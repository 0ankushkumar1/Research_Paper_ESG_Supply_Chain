The study collected 2,400 financial data and ESG performance of 200 companies from the Clean 200 list of global public companies from 2019 to 2021. It aimed to: 1) evaluate green supply chain performance based on financial indicators and corporate’s ESG performance; 2) use the entropy weight method (EWM) to determine the weight of ESG elements in green supply chain; 3) validate this ESG-based green supply chain performance using real world examples. The results showed that operational performance had the highest weight, followed by environmental performance, and profitability ranked the last. The results suggested that managers should focus more on the governance and environment rather than emphasizing short-term financial benefits. It contributes to the literature by incorporating ESG to evaluate green supply chain performance, which is the first of its kind. The results would be beneficial when people wish to select supply chain partners. They are also conducive to companies’ managers and listed companies when they submit financial reports that need to report ESG performance.

The burgeoning demand for fast fashion, often reliant on cheap and environmentally unsustainable textiles, exacerbates this environmental degradation. To facilitate a harmonized and sustainable progression of the entire TA industry, this study employs the Stackelberg game model to investigate the prerequisites for establishing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related cost-sharing contracts and their consequential effects on supply chain coordination. Specifically, the paper compares four distinct supply chain models under two conditions: whether market demand is stochastic or deterministic. Through this comparative analysis, the study finds that the ESG related cost-sharing contracts bring more profit to the textile and apparel supply chain (TASC) in deterministic and stochastic demand, which effectively mitigates the risks associated with unpredictable demand. Numerical results indicate that the ESG cost-sharing contract significantly improves TASC's ESG performance with customers' sustainable awareness increasing. Furthermore, such contracts are instrumental in enhancing the aggregate ESG environmental performance of the Textile and Apparel Supply Chain (TASC), elevating profits for both manufacturers and retailers and alleviating the impact of fluctuating demand on supply chain participants. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","ESG cost-sharing; Stochastic demand; Supply chain system; Textile and apparel industries","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Environmental management; Profitability; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Textile industry; Apparel industry; Apparel supply chains; Cost sharing; Cost sharing contracts; Environmental, social, and governance cost-sharing; Stochastic-demand; Supply chain coordination; Supply chain systems; Textile and apparel industry; Textile supply chain; Textiles","M.

Starting with an overview of the CSDD Directive’s legislative process and main obligations, this article then focuses on conducting a comparative study between the CSDD Directive and the German Supply Chain Regulation (“Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz”). The two regulations share similarities in terms of structure and scope, enabling a meaningful comparison. Notably, the German Regulation contains a procurement clause (s.22), that allows exclusion of non-compliant companies from public procurement procedures. This provision is unparalleled among the European Union’s mandatory due diligence laws and sets a precedent for the European legislator. This article argues that including a clause similar to s.22 of the German Regulation in the CSDD Directive would serve the overarching goal of sustainability, help prevent human rights violations and promote the CSDD Directive’s enforceability. This article outlines the effects of such a procurement clause on companies and contracting authorities, as well as its potential impact on Member State legislation, particularly the German. The findings are of value to policymakers, companies, government authorities, and other stakeholders interested in sustainable procurement practices. © 2023 Thomson Reuters and Contributors.","Due diligence; Environmental social governance; EU law; Germany; Public procurement; Supply chains; Sustainability","","","English","Public.

Green supply chain management is considered a way to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change concerns. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate whether sustainable supply chain practices reduce carbon emissions and whether supplier environmental, social, and governance (ESG) training further enhances this effect, thereby reinforcing the negative association. We collected data for an international sample of manufacturing firms from Thomson Reuters Eikon for the period between 2002 and 2021 and ran a country–year fixed-effects regression. To address endogeneity, we also utilized two-stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. Our findings indicate that sustainable supply chain practices alleviate carbon emissions. Furthermore, we found that supplier ESG training strengthens this relationship, leading to even higher reductions in carbon emissions. Specifically, this training reinforces the negative association between sustainable supply chain practices and carbon emissions, resulting in a more pronounced decrease in carbon emissions. These results are robust to alternative proxies, samples, and endogeneity concerns. Our study highlights the importance of policy development and collaborative interorganizational actions among supply chain partners in developing solutions to climate change issues. As supply chain activities generate high levels of emissions and regulatory press is mounting, our findings may help firms take proactive actions for greener supply chain management and avoid regulatory sanctions. Additionally, we found that institutional strength stimulates firms' clean supply chain practices. Therefore, we advise policymakers to develop and implement necessary policies in less developed countries with weak public environmental regulations. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","carbon emission; ESG training; green supply chain; stakeholder theory; sustainable supply chain","carbon emission; climate change; supply chain management; sustainability; training","A.S.

Questions were raised on how Industry 4.0 and green practices improve green supply chain performance with the mediation role of green servitization? Green servitization now addresses product service systems and environmental impacts. This study is crucial because environmental unpredictability is causing the supply chain to migrate toward green and digital supply chains, which reduce environmental impact and increase efficiency. The institutional and resource-based view theory-based research model checks the moderation of Environmental, social and government (ESG) compliance and the mediation role of green servitization for environmental advantages. It helps to develop a research model. Structural equation modeling applies to check the model and hypotheses' significance. The unique research model with the three hypotheses is validated with less than two-tailed 0.001 significance, showing that Industry 4.0 and green practices positively affect green servitization and green supply chain (GSC) performance while moderating ESG compliance.

Our objective was to find whether independent tobacco supply chain companies similarly lack transparency on tobacco-related activities while prominently displaying ESG. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, mentions of tobacco supply chain activities and ESG company official documentation and websites were explored for independent tobacco supply chain companies (n=80) with identified annual reports included in the Tobacco Supply Chain Database. Bivariable statistical analysis tested for differences in the visibility of tobacco supply chain contribution and ESG within official documents and websites. In depth exploration was undertaken for seven case study companies. Results: Independent tobacco supply chain companies were significantly less likely to mention their tobacco supply chain contribution than ESG (31% and 80%, respectively p<0.001) in annual reporting. Tobacco supply chain contribution was also less prominent than ESG on websites (29% and 79%, respectively, mentioned on the home page or a home page menu p<0.001). The companies were making median annual profits of over US$2 million (n=76), with a large variation of revenue from tobacco activity (5-100%) where it was reported (n=9). Conclusions: Independent tobacco supply chain companies undertake ESG activities that they prominently display in official reporting and on websites while often being less transparent about their tobacco supply chain contribution. Potential investors and customers may thus be misled about the companies' true nature. More rigorous reporting requirements are needed.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Additionally, questions have arisen about whether these disclosures affect the firm’s value. Therefore, we conducted a bibliometric analysis coupled with a systematic literature review (SLR) of the current literature in the Scopus database from 2001 to 2023. We utilized VOS viewer, Site Space, and R Studio tools for this analysis. Our findings indicate that the relationship between ESG disclosures and the firm’s value has different effects and that disclosure impacts through various channels, such as increasing stakeholder trust. Moreover, the keyword analysis results before and after 2015 demonstrate significant advancement in the utilization of a theoretical foundation in the literature. Furthermore, China (Country), “Universidad de Salamanca” (University), “Uyar, Ali and García-Sánchez, Isabel-María” (Authors), and “Sustainability” and “Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management” (Journals) were the most contributing and influential in this field. On the other hand, the results revealed six thematic clusters: society, sustainable development, ESG, organization, innovation, and stakeholders. We found promising research paths and emerging themes through content analysis of these clusters, such as sustainability assurance, green innovation, and sustainable development goals (SDGs).

In this study, we treat a firm's ESG score as a demonstration of strategic choice in the level of transparency that results in increased firm performance as measured by Tobin's Q and return on assets. Performance differences are a result of choice moderated by the size of the firm as measured by employees and sales. We analyze 467 firms in the S&P 500 from 2009 to 2015. Applying legitimacy and stakeholder theory, we find that there is significant difference between groups with respect to disclosure and performance. The results of quartile analysis by sales, capitalization, and Tobin's Q are relevant to understand the influence that the ESG score has on financial performance. ESG influences on Tobin's Q are greatest for large firms as measured by sales, as opposed to the ESG affects on Tobin's Q and return on asset for smallest firms as measured by market capitalization. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","corporate social responsibility; environmental social governance; legitimacy theory; performance; stakeholder theory","capital market; corporate social responsibility; environmental impact; finance; governance approach; industrial performance; social status; stakeholder","M.C.

In Canada, ESG reporting is not obligatory, and multiple frameworks are used making performance comparisons across producers challenging. Additionally, methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are underestimated in Canada which also suggests systemic under-reporting of emissions in this key area of carbon intensity. Here we investigate 2019 methane emission intensity gaps for 70 of Canada's largest oil and gas producers, between 1) provincial regulatory submissions, 2) assumed contributions to the federal inventory estimates, 3) a mobile ground laboratory measurement-based inventory, 4) and producer self-published ESG. We de-aggregated existing methane inventory estimates and measurements for Canada's largest producing province, Alberta, and found a greater than 1000-fold variation in methane intensities within the cohort. We also found surprisingly broad agreement in assumed methane emission intensities between (2) and (3), suggesting they capture the same signals. Regulatory submissions captured only a small amount of the total methane inventory and we also observed a low bias in regulatory reporting. In conclusion, we believe that changes to required and voluntary reporting, and associated systems management frameworks are needed to differentiate oil and gas producers and preserve market access based on carbon intensity. © 2022 The Authors","ESG disclosure; Leak rate; Methane emissions; Oil and gas; Sustainability","Carbon; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Sustainable development; Carbon intensity; Emissions intensity; Environmental, social, governance disclosure; Leak rate; Methane emissions; Oil and gas; Oil and gas producers; Oil and gas production; Performance; Regulatory submissions; Methane","M.

Utilizing the supply chain innovation and application pilot policy as a quasi-natural experiment, we assess the causal impact of supply chain digitization on corporate environmental practices. Our findings reveal that supply chain digital innovation substantially enhances corporate environmental practices. We discuss four underlying economic mechanisms behind this causality: efficiency, governance, resource allocation, and innovation improvements. Furthermore, the impact is more pronounced for industries with high transportation costs, as well as for non-high-tech sectors and non-state-owned enterprises. When companies face weaker environmental regulations, this effect is further amplified. Moreover, we examine the spillover effects of supply chain digital innovation on the environmental practices of upstream and downstream enterprises. The results suggest that supply chain digital innovation could trigger desirable economic consequences by exerting positive impacts on sales volume and market value. These findings offer practical implications for policymakers to leverage smart and digital supply chain systems in attaining SDGs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","China; Corporate environmental practices; Digital technology; Supply chain digital innovation; Sustainable development","Sustainable city; China; Corporate environmental practice; Corporates; Digital innovations; Digital technologies; Environmental challenges; Environmental practices; Operational efficiencies; Supply chain digital innovation; Sustainable growth; corporate strategy; environmental economics; innovation; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal; technological development; Sustainable development goals","H.

By employing a Stackelberg game model, this paper investigates how the mechanism of cross-shareholding affects operational behaviour in a green supply chain. Specifically, we examine how cross-shareholding affects pricing strategies, carbon emissions reduction and profit in two supply chain models with different power structures, namely the manufacturer-dominated supply chain (MD model) and the retailer-dominated supply chain (RD model). We find that both the manufacturer and the retailer in the green supply chain reduce more carbon emissions after cross-shareholding. Both the manufacturer and the retailer can earn greater profits than would be possible in a decentralised supply chain when the proportion of cross-shareholding meets a certain threshold. Furthermore, our results show that the ratio of carbon emissions reduction between the manufacturer and the retailer in the cross-shareholding supply chain is affected by the proportion of shares and the power structure. In the MD model, carbon emissions reduction is positively affected by the proportion of the manufacturer's shares held by the retailer. In the RD model, it is negatively affected by the proportion of the retailer's shares held by the manufacturer. A revenue-sharing contract can be adopted to improve the performance of the cross-shareholding supply chain. Our results have important managerial implications for companies who intend to improve their environmental and financial performances through cross-shareholding when a centralised decision is difficult to achieve. © 2021","Coordination; Cross-shareholding; Game theory; Green contribution; Green supply chain; Power structure","Carbon; Emission control; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Carbon emissions reductions; Financial performance; Green supply chain; Managerial implications; Pricing strategy; Revenue sharing contracts; Stackelberg Games; Supply chain models; Green manufacturing","B.

The model traces silver from mining to PV module manufacturing, from 1995 to 2021. The supply of silver powder, paste, PV cells, and modules is found to be highly concentrated. These supply chains are linked to substantial ESG risks, mostly nested in fabrication and manufacturing, some of which have worsened over time. Over 87% of the silver used in PV transits through at least one country with a very high risk factor.

Although it is complex, it is also hard to implement and measure collaborative initiatives in the field of the supply chain. This study aims to examine the role of information technology (IT) and people’s involvement in OP through the mediation of supply chain collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a deductive and quantitative approach to test the research hypotheses. Data was collected from 249 supply chain professionals working at various manufacturing firms. Findings: This research found a significant effect of IT on supply chain collaboration. Similarly, people involvement (PI) also significantly influenced the supply chain collaboration. For the mediation hypotheses, SCC significantly mediates the relationships between two independent variables (IT and PI) and OP. Furthermore, the full mediation of SCC occurred. Originality/value: This study provides a framework emphasizing manufacturing firms’ practices, SCC and OP. The “people involvement” was found as a novel variable in the tested model using the resource-based view as a supporting theory. The research findings can benefit the professionals working on supply chain business processes to improve OP. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Collaboration; Information technology; Manufacturing; People involvement; Supply chain performance","","N.A.

This study uses data from publicly listed automotive manufacturing firms from 2009 to 2022 to examine the impact of target firms’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on total-factor productivity (TFP) at upstream and downstream firms from a supply-chain perspective. By employing a two-way, fixed-effects model, mediation analysis, and a moderation model, the study provides comprehensive insights. The findings reveal the following: (1) The ESG performance of target firms in automotive manufacturing significantly improves the TFP of downstream customers, and this conclusion is robust even when using instrumental variable methods, additional control variables, and rigorous robustness tests. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that the ESG performance of target firms alleviates the financing constraints of their customers, thereby positively impacting the customers’ TFP. Additionally, the study finds that the monopolistic power of the target firm negatively moderates the relationship between its ESG performance and the TFP of its customers. These empirical findings enhance the understanding of supply-chain spillover effects and provide a new theoretical foundation for improving firms’ ESG performance. © 2024 by the authors.","ESG performance; financing constraints; monopolistic advantage; total-factor productivity","automobile industry; corporate social responsibility; firm size; manufacturing; spillover effect; supply chain management; sustainability; total factor productivity","K.

This growth has led to unsustainable consumption of scarce resources such as energy, food, and water, thereby challenging GCC countries to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). Accordingly, these countries faced several environmental and social problems because of the rising pollution, and the rapid increase in economic activities. This paper seeks to examine the impact of environmental, social, and governance factors on achieving sustainable development goals in GCC countries. The study employs secondary data from the United Nations (UN) and World Development Indicators (WDI), spanning the years 2000 to 2021. To assess data stationarity, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied. Both short- and long-term relationships among the variables are analyzed using a pooled mean group (PMG) panel autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) econometric model. Results indicate a significant positive association between environmental governance, social governance, corporate governance, and the attainment of SDGs. This indicates that the country that has a high implementation of ESG strategies is more likely to achieve SDGs. The findings of this study are useful for government entities, business organizations, and potential research to formulate policy guidelines while maintaining SDGs through ESG. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Economic development; Environmental; SDG achievements; Social and governance","","A.

This trend is accompanied by a surge of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) standards used to justify a perceived just transition. Through an analysis of 13 widely used international instruments and the ways mining companies adopt them, this article develops a comparative examination of Western and Chinese ESG practices, with a focus on guidelines and standards aimed at mitigating the socio-environmental impacts of extractivism. Despite conventional portrayals of Western and Chinese governance standards as disparate or in competition, we find their standards evolve in tandem and conversation in the context of the rush for critical minerals, underscoring the need to move beyond a Western-Chinese binary. This research also challenges the notion of China attempting to set global standards. Chinese companies increasingly embrace ESG principles due to reputational risks, national standardization efforts, and international partnerships. They, however, focus more on downstream stakeholders, while Western counterparts lean towards upstream considerations. Notably, guidelines are employed similarly by Western and Chinese companies, albeit influenced by geographical, material, and political considerations.

As the world focuses on ESG investments, the media shed light on ESG controversies or concerns, such as tax frauds and harmful products. These controversies place companies at risk and consequently harm their sustainable development. Using a unique supply chain dataset from McDonald’s Corporation, this study (i) develops a two-stage efficiency evaluation framework with a metafrontier range directional model in data envelopment analysis (DEA) and (ii) examines the relationship between DEA efficiency scores and ESG and ESG controversy scores through regression analysis. Results show that research and development efficiency (0.910) contributes more to overall efficiency than to profitability efficiency (0.700). While ESG scores positively impact efficiency, ESG controversies exert a negative effect, except for companies with ISO14000 environmental management certification. This study not only reinforces stakeholder theory by highlighting the critical role of ESG practices in enhancing company efficiency and stakeholder engagement but also provides actionable insights for policymakers and management teams to foster sustainable development through strategic ESG investments and partnerships. Overall, this study underscores the importance of examining stakeholder engagement in achieving sustainable development goals by managing financial and R&D resources, investing in ESG, and addressing ESG controversies among supply chains. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Data envelopment analysis; Environmental, social, and governance; ISO14000; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable development goals","","I.W.K.

We answer this question by studying the impact of geopolitical conflict of a country on the ESG performance, separately and collectively, of firms of that country. We use data from Refinitiv and UCDP/PRIO (Uppsala Conflict Data Program/International Peace Research Institute, Oslo) databases for the period from 2002 to 2021 for 79 countries and we use fixed effects regression as our main methodology. We find that if a country is in a geopolitical conflict, their firms are impacted in the form of lower E, S and G performance and overall ESG performance, with stronger effects for developed countries. This comes on top of the direct costs of geopolitical conflicts. Our results are robust to country, year and firm fixed effects as well as robust to endogeneity as we use Lewbel (2012) estimator to eliminate any chances of endogeneity.

In this study, a novel framework is presented that demonstrates how the universal immunization program (UIP) India can utilize the key performance indicators (KPIs) of its vaccine supply chain (VSC) towards the goal of sustainable development (SD) of Mission Indradhanush. Based on the expert's opinions and an in-depth review of the literature, 57 performance indicators of VSC and 52 sustainability practices criteria (SPC) were identified. Using the balanced scorecard (BSC), the performance indicators were assessed in four dimensions: learning and growth, internal process, customer, and finance; whereas SPC were evaluated in three dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Further, from the field survey in 3 states of India, 248 valid questionnaires were collected, which were used to conduct exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the analysis revealed that the learning and growth and internal process KPIs of VSC have a positive and significant effect on the success of Mission Indradhanush sustainable development. In addition, results also revealed that the internal process mediates the relationship of learning and growth and sustainable performance and is the main dimension of VSC to strive towards sustainability. The findings of the present study will be beneficial to the policy-makers for measuring, monitoring, and improving the performance of immunization programs so as to build up the sustainability in Mission Indradhanush. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Balanced scorecard; Mission Indradhanush; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable development; Vaccine supply chain","","D.

Companies are progressively incorporating environmentally friendly practices into their strategies to tackle this global problem. Accordingly, the increase in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks has increased the importance of sustainable corporate governance. As a result, companies tend to place more emphasis on ESG initiatives. The study aims to analyze the importance levels of ESG criteria and to select the most ideal environmentally sensitive competitive strategy for multinational logistics companies. For this purpose, a set of criteria and alternatives for the businesses in the context of the related problem was defined, and a decision model was proposed to handle problems, which include uncertain information. In this context, q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) weighted average technique was used for weighting the criteria and q-ROF-evaluation based on distance from average solution (q-ROF-EDAS) method was utilized for prioritizing the strategies. As a result, “greenhouse gas emissions” was identified as the most important criterion, while “eco-efficiency” was selected as the best option for environmentally conscious competitive strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

The carbon footprint (CFP) of industrial production, especially in the resources industry is an essential part of the environmental, social, governance (ESG) criteria which are part of the fight against climate change. The CFP is measured in t CO2e(CO2equivalent) and strongly correlated to the energy intensity in MWh/t of produced mineral. The CFP is strongly dependent on locations and infrastructure where the specific energy supply structure is mainly determining the magnitude of emissions. The ET is demanding huge amounts of steel, metals and other critical minerals from fresh production or from recycled materials. The resources industry is confronted with three Scopes of GHG-Emissions. Scope 1 emissions are the directly released CO2emissions especially from diesel fuels used in mining operations, but also the methane gas emissions from coal deposits during mining. Scope 2 covers the indirect emissions from purchased energy, such as electric power but also inherently contained emissions in consumables and machinery. Scope 3 are the emissions in the downstream chain, released from the customers using the mined and processed minerals. They include ocean transportation of bulk material and all corporate overhead activities. While the scope 1 & 2 emissions account for 4 to 7 % of global GHG releases, this number increases to almost 30 % when the huge amount scope 3 is included. The best way to reduce the CFP is the use of regenerative energies, such as hydropower, solar- and wind energy. The article clarifies the CFP of the steel and iron-ore and cement industry and of the minerals and metals for the electric vehicles (EVs) such as aluminium, cobalt, copper, graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel and rare earths. The CFP of recycling within a circular economy is treated as well as the plans in the mining industry to reduce the CFP. Technical solutions to reduce the CFP in opencut and underground mining operations are presented. The most effective is electrification of mining equipment based on regenerative energies by use of trolley assisted trucks, batteries and hydrogen fuel-cells. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and the special CO2-sequestration in waste rock or mine tailings is explained. The related subjects tracing of GHG emissions including greenwashing in the supply chains are pointed out. Finally, regulatory actions of governments and corporate initiatives to control ESG compliance with regards to emission control are shown. © 2022 GDMB Gesellschaft fur Bergbau, Metallurgie, Rohstoff- und Umwelttechnik e.V..

The hands-on simulation is called Business Process Integration Simulation, or BPIsim. Participants collaborate on a five-member supply chain team comprised of an end-user, a distributor/dealer, a manufacturer (OEM), and two suppliers. While partaking in the simulation, participants actively experience the exchange of tangible resources (e.g., preprinted documents; prop cash money; packaging; and component, raw, semi-finished, finished, and trading goods inventories, etc.) and construct tangible products for the benefit of the customer. When the simulation is complete, the participants will have learned major ERP concepts and the five major activities associated with plan, source, make, deliver, and return management processes that are prominently highlighted in the seminal Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model. Quantitative and qualitative data indicate that the hands-on simulation is not only intuitive, engaging, and fun, but also a highly-effective experiential learning activity to improve understanding of key business processes that span across five key supply chain members. ©2020 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

Using the panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2018 to 2022, in this article, we empirically demonstrate that Fintech adoption can significantly improve sustainable supply chain management performance. This improvement is primarily attributed to Fintech's ability to enhance information transparency and refine decision-making capabilities, thereby fostering sustainability. Furthermore, green innovation, digital innovation policies, top management team forward-looking innovation orientation, and persistent innovation orientation strengthen the relationship between Fintech adoption and sustainable supply chain management performance. Green innovation enables firms to comply with environmental regulations and gain a competitive advantage, thereby facilitating the integration of Fintech into sustainable supply chain management. Digital innovation policies provide regulatory support and establish norms, creating a conducive environment for technology applications.

Based on the signaling theory, our study investigates the operational benefit of supply chain transparency in terms of ESG (SCT-ESG). To further clarify the signaling process, the moderating roles of digitalization of the firm and signal strength are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal secondary data from multiple databases are matched and analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to validate the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Results suggest that with SCT-ESG, firms have a weakened disparity between production variance and demand variance, and the supply chain experiences a reduced bullwhip effect. Further, digitalization of the focal company and signal strength reinforce the negative effect of SCT-ESG on the bullwhip effect. Originality/value: The study integrates the SCT and ESG literature through SCT-ESG, extending benefits of ESG disclosure to the supply chain context. It extends the application of the signaling theory in OSCM by including contextual factors of digitalization and signal strength. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bullwhip effect; Digitalization; ESG transparency; Noise; Signal strength; Supply chain transparency","","T.-M.

ESG performance has become an essential business strategy. This study examines the combined effect of carbon tax, emissions trading systems (ETS), and ESG initiatives of a sample semiconductor company. We use a multi-objective mixed integer programming (MOMIP) model to investigate the production, carbon emissions, and job creation for the global supply chain of an Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM). This study examines how an IDM's ESG initiative affects facility location selection, machine procurement, profit, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We apply the proposed MOMIP model to a supply chain network of global semiconductor manufacturers. An example of an illustrative IDM company is used to validate the model's effectiveness. The results suggest that adopting ESG strategies does not significantly increase costs in the supply chain while reducing carbon emissions and increasing job creation. Therefore, semiconductor manufacturing companies benefit from ESG management and should put more resources into promoting it. This study contributes to the literature on developing a framework to assess ESG management in the global semiconductor supply chain.

This paper considers an integrated three-stage forward and reverse supply chain, which provides new and remanufactured green products to a green conscious market. Both the manufacturer and the remanufacturer invest on green manufacturing processes. Our research problem is the coordination of this integrated green supply chain through contracts. We develop an integrated two-part tariff contract so that all supply chain members act rationally according to the centralized solution. Along with its coordination ability, we also develop a mathematical model to determine the contract parameters so that the contract is fair and each supply chain member benefits from the contract almost evenly. The results denote that as the consumers become more sensitive to the greening levels of new and remanufactured products, the manufacturer and the remanufacturer determine higher greening levels; also the demands for both types of green products increase; and the overall supply chain earns more profit. As more green products are sold, collector becomes more sufficient to collect used products from the market, which also increases the remanufacturer's greening level, the demand for remanufactured products, and the profit of the overall supply chain. Thus, a greening initiative has a positive impact on the others; and this leads to a more successful supply chain both in environmental and economic dimensions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Contract; Coordination; Game theory; Green supply chain; Supply chain management","Commerce; Environmental protection; Investments; Profitability; Supply chains; Competitive business; Coordination ability; Environmental policy; Green manufacturing process; Green supply chain; Remanufactured products; Reverse supply chains; Two-part tariff contract; Green manufacturing","","English","J.

To take into account the carbon footprint on crude oil from its international distribution segment, we utilize a micro-level dataset of more than 28,000 individual shipment samples to estimate each journey's carbon emissions. The unique detailed dataset enables us to aggregate carbon emissions at the country level for importers and exporters, by trade lane, and by vessel size categories. Our methodology provides a framework for crude oil consumers to dynamically account for the carbon footprint of the commodity which is transported via different trade routes and by different vessels (size and age). So far, this dynamic emissions accounting has been largely neglected by oil consumers who typically apply one single emission factor regardless its supply chain. Our results highlight the importance for importers to consider the origin and point-of-use of crude oil in order to have a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint. The quantitative analysis in this study can feed into well-to-tank fuel emissions factors for oil and oil products in order to adopt dynamic emissions factors in companies' carbon accounting. Finally, our research is important for the design of new environmental policies for the corporate Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reporting to include downstream logistics in the overall emission accounting of oil companies. © 2020 The Author(s)","AIS; Carbon emissions; Crude oil; ESG; Sustainability; Well-to-tank","Carbon footprint; Commerce; Crude oil; Emission control; Environmental protection; Fuel tanks; Oil tankers; Petroleum industry; Supply chains; Waterway transportation; Carbon accounting; Carbon emissions; Emission factors; Emissions factors; Environmental policy; Fuel emissions; Maritime transportation; Oil companies; annual variation; carbon emission; crude oil; environmental management; fuel consumption; maritime transportation; sustainability; Petroleum transportation","H.

However, they revealed the presence of divergent viewpoints in discussing the sustainability-resilience relationship. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Network Analysis that combines the traditional systematic literature review with bibliometric techniques to analyse how the relationship between supply chain sustainability and supply chain resilience has been addressed by previous literature in the main research thematic areas of the field. The analysis revealed the presence of four perspectives for organizing the concepts of supply chain sustainability and supply chain resilience, sustainability and resilience are considered to be two different concepts that rely on separate and distinguishable goals, resilience is considered a component of sustainability, sustainability is considered a component of resilience, and they are considered as synonyms. The rationale for the presence of different perspectives can be identified in the level of detail with which sustainability and resilience objectives are considered. As a result, an original framework is developed to explain the different perspectives and link them with the emerging research streams of the literature.

Findings: ESG performance of an enterprise can positively promote enterprise technology innovation, and the conclusion is still valid after the robustness test. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of ESG performance on enterprise technology innovation is different when considering the nature of corporate ownership and industries. Mechanism analysis shows that ESG performance can positively promote enterprise technology innovation by improving supply chain relationship stability.

The results show that manufacturers should provide trade credit and participate in retailers’ financing decisions to avoid double marginal effects under both centralized and decentralized decision-making. Interestingly, the optimal value of green marketing effort and retailer order quantity was twice as high as the decentralized under the centralized decision, indicating that the centralized decision could better improve GSC’s financing efficiency.

However, for environmentally sensitive corporations, ESG disclosure is not only a regulatory obligation. It also has the potential to promote corporate reputation. This study aims to uncover the motivating factors behind ESG disclosures in an emerging economy. The research methodology employed in the study includes (i) systematically reviewing literature following the PRISMA protocol to identify ESG disclosure motives, (ii) integrating fuzzy set theory with interpretive structural modelling (FISM) for developing a structural hierarchical model to understand the interactions between the motives, (iii) applying a fuzzy Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment (Fuzzy MICMAC) approach to categorize the motives. The FISM model shows that organizations primarily disclose ESG information in response to regulatory and stakeholders’ pressures. The results further highlight the role of corporate ‘greenwashing’ behaviour and ethical considerations in ESG. The findings recommend that feasible regulations are crucial in improving ESG reporting quantity and quality. This research is one of the very few examining the motives behind ESG disclosures and a ‘stepping-stone’ to implementing mandatory ESG disclosure regulations.

Despite this growing interest, significant gaps persist in understanding the motivations behind ESG disclosure, specific practices, and the consequences it causes from a supply chain management (SCM) perspective. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of 64 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2024. Using the belief–action–outcome framework, our review identified several SCM-related beliefs that drive firms’ ESG disclosures. We also detailed specific practices and outcomes at the supply chain level. Additionally, the review synthesized various SCM-related enablers and barriers to ESG disclosure. Finally, we integrated these insights into a conceptual framework and developed a research agenda to explore ESG further within the SCM context. This research represents the first comprehensive review to systematically analyze ESG disclosure with SCM, making a significant contribution to the ESG in the SCM research stream and laying a robust foundation for future studies. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","belief–action–outcome; conceptual development; ESG disclosure; supply chain management","Supply chain management; Belief–action–outcome; Chain management; Conceptual development; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental, social, and governance disclosure; Journal articles; Management research; Research agenda; Synthesised; Systematic literature review","L.

However, shipping stock prices were highly volatile during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify the causal relationships of the four dimensions (financial performance, bond financing, environmental, social, governance, and COVID-19) and 20 criteria affecting the sustainability of global shipping companies. The research scope includes a sample of nine listed international shipping companies accounting for 49% of the global market share with data collected from 2010 to 2020. Survey responses from 15 investment experts were also obtained. We applied a hybrid multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method integrating the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process, and modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno techniques to be the DANP-mV model to identify the causal relationships among the dimensions and criteria, providing ways of narrowing the performance gaps of shipping companies. The results indicate that financial performance is the main cause affecting COVID-19 and ESG practices. The ESG practices influence bond financing. The largest performance gaps across shipping companies include earnings per share (EPS), yield to maturity, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and timely delivery. The findings of this study suggest that shipping companies may focus on gross profit margin to improve EPS, term to maturity to enhance yield to maturity, social distancing policy to meet timely delivery, and the board size to enhance corporate social responsibility (CSR). The outcome of this study aids shipping companies in prioritizing their resources and investors in selecting shipping company stocks in response to COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

Developing countries are considered the new fertile territory for developing global chains for multinational enterprises (MNEs). Despite the positive outcomes derived from this global development, it also induces negative impacts in the domain of domestic firms' competition, education, welfare and infrastructure system. A way to overcome this pessimistic view has been found in corporate social responsibility (CSR) best practices. MNEs seek to involve local stakeholders in their social activities to show their commitment and generate innovations. It calls for a multi-tier domestic involvement integrated into a global supply chain to create value. This study builds its empirical analysis exploring a range of 1547 Chinese manufacturing multinational enterprises listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2010 and 2018. The findings revealed that multi-tier supply chain integration (SCI) practices positively moderate the relationship between CSR and MNE performance. In turn, it implies benefits for developing sustainable development goals, generating new job opportunities mostly in the developing countries guaranteeing wealth employment conditions. The sense of involvement and engagement towards their employees requires more development of CSR practices, which can be moderated by multi-tier SCI, as shown in the present study. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Chinese MNEs; corporate social responsibility; multi-tier supply chain integration","","V.

Moreover, this study identifies the critical drivers of corporate sustainability by focusing on the levels of market developments and geographical regions. Design/methodology/approach: Based on corporate sustainability data of 2,725 global companies in 2016, this study uses a combination of analytical techniques including cluster analysis, data mining, partial least square path modeling and importance performance map analysis. Findings: This study finds that companies in European developed markets exhibit the highest-ranking of corporate sustainability. In line with the social impact hypothesis, environmental, social and governance performance positively affects economic performance. Moreover, there is strong evidence of causal relationships and synergistic effects among the four pillars of corporate sustainability. In accordance with the institutional theory, the patterns of causal directions and the critical pillars depend on levels of market developments and geographical regions. Overall, social and environmental pillars are among the most critical drivers of corporate sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The methodology does not aim to provide a new weighting scheme for calculating the corporate sustainability index. Practical implications: Corporate managers should consider sustainability practices in all dimensions to benefit from synergistic effects among environmental, social, governance and economic activities. Furthermore, corporate sustainability strategies should not be generalized across countries with different levels of market developments and geographical regions.

We determine the equilibrium state of members by using variational inequality and then construct a network equilibrium model that considers these three policies. A modified projection algorithm is used to verify and solve the model. The results show that a higher CTP helps to reduce carbon emissions but reduces the transaction quantity of products. Further, when the CTP increases, the system’s profits increase only under the LPS policy. However, regardless of the CTP level implemented, if the CT rate is higher than the subsidy level, carbon emissions are lower. Notably, under the same levels of LPS and CT, LPS has a greater effect on the system. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cap-and-trade; carbon tax; carbon trading price; low-carbon product subsidy; network equilibrium; Supply chain network","","X.

However, the ways in which IM enhances environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance, along with its potential mechanisms, remain unexplored. This study employs a two-way fixed-effects model with panel data from 4417 Chinese listed firms spanning the period 2009–2022 to examine these relationships. It is found that IM significantly improves corporate ESG performance. Robustness tests confirm the reliability of these results, and mechanism analysis highlights the mediating effects of information transparency, green technology innovation, and supply chain collaborative innovation. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that IM has a notably stronger effect in high-carbon-emission sectors, state-owned enterprises, and high-tech industries. This suggests that policymakers should design differentiated policies based on industry and firm characteristics to promote the adoption of IM and foster sustainable development strategies. This research contributes to expanding the theoretical understanding of how IM affects ESG while also providing empirical evidence for enterprises and governments to promote green transformation. © 2024 by the authors.","ESG performance; green technological innovation; information transparency; intelligent manufacturing (IM); supply chain collaboration","China; high technology industry; industrial performance; innovation; manufacturing; policy making; strategic approach; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal","C.

Here, we use a sample of 25 Indian firms listed for their sustainability performances in the Thomson Reuters Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores. The sustainability performance data have been accessed from the Bloomberg terminal, where the overall sustainability performance on ESG is measured as a discounted score on ESG considering various controversies on ESG reported for the firm. And for the study, we associate financial data using the profit indicators of firms. We perceive that the sustainable supply chain practices considering environmental, social and governance performances may not positively impact the financial performance measured by the Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), during the considered period of five years for the study. We construct the empirical model and use Partial Least Square (PLS) regression modeling to analyze the results. The study can be further extended for many Indian firms and for firms across different developing economies, as well.

Various organizations seek to implement SSCM to achieve their competitive advantage. One of the important implementation activities is the identification of drivers and barriers of strategy implementation, which has been a focus area for scholars. The purpose of this paper is to identify key drivers and barriers to creating and improving sustainability in the Iranian oil and gas supply chain. However, a distinct focus on the oil industry has been the subject of limited previous attention. This study is planned to recognize and prioritize the drivers and barriers for implementation of SSCM in Iranian oil context. These drivers and barriers are presented in a form of a conceptual framework. A comprehensive literary review using metasynthesis is used to identify a number of drivers and barriers that identifies 112 drivers and 41 barriers and then evaluates using the Delphi three-round study. The evaluation process involves 30 supply chain management experts from oil companies, and the analysis showed the important drivers and barriers for consideration in SSCM implementation. The proposed drivers and barriers enable the oil supply chain manager to identify appropriate strategies for deploying and improving SSCM implementation in the company. This study would expand the scope of SSCM research in the context of oil. In addition, the identification of drivers and barriers would be useful for industrial decision makers, policy planners, and strategic managers to recognize a set of related hurdles for effective SSCM implementation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","barriers; drivers; implementation; improvement; oil industry; Sustainable Supply Chain Management","Iran; competitiveness; conceptual framework; implementation process; oil industry; prioritization; supply chain management; sustainability","A.

The present paper aims to map this growing literature to understand how SCC can contribute to the achievement of broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Via a systematic review of literature (SLR), the paper maps key themes at the intersection of SCC and sustainable development. Relying on nine key themes, the study presents novel insights into the domain of SCC for sustainable development. The results of the SLR reveal that collaborative innovation, collaborative process and product development are key mechanisms driving SCC. However, the extant literature has not devoted much attention to the effectiveness of SCC mechanisms or their performance. Further, the current study posits that more effective SCC strategies can boost the sustainable operational performance of the supply chain (SC) by enhancing capacity building and resource utilisation. Based on the contingency approach, this study offers a novel framework linking SCC to SDGs. The study thus has the potential to help managers and practitioners identify strategic fields of action for achieving SDGs. © 2022 The Authors","Coordination; Supply chain collaboration; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable supply chain","","","English","J.

However, regulations on cross-ownership within green supply chains are still in their early stages of development. Cross-ownership affects both the government’s pricing strategy and its carbon reduction policies. Additionally, the cross-shareholding structure impacts the profitability of the supply chain by introducing power dynamics between manufacturers and retailers. When cross-shareholding regulations and models are implemented, manufacturers and retailers within the supply chain exhibit more substantial reductions in their carbon footprint and experience increased profits, particularly in decentralized supply chains when cross-ownership surpasses a specific threshold. The adoption of cross-shareholding profit-sharing agreements could enhance the performance of green supply chains. This article synthesizes the views of scholars on cross-shareholding in the supply chain. It uses analytical methods to evaluate the role of the negotiation process, trade credit, and cross-shareholding in the supply chain. The article uses jurisprudence to recommend a cross-shareholding policy in the Philippines to enhance supply chain efficiency. It uses the “Stackelberg Leadership Model” to analyze the impact of cross-shareholding on two levels of the supply chain, offering recommendations for future implementation to improve supply chain efficiency. The article recommends that the Philippines’ supply chain policy include mechanisms to encourage new companies to join the existing cross-ownership network, capitalize on the impact of cross-shareholding on supply chain assessment, and develop ways to use equity ratio and trade credit. These recommendations aim to refine policy and legislation in the Philippines to effectively utilize trade credit, equity ratios, and cross-shareholdings in supply chain management. © 2023, University of Southeastern Philippines.

Using the differences-in-differences (DID) model, we have tested the relationship between the low-carbon city pilot policy in the location of the largest customer and affiliated suppliers’ innovation behavior. Our findings indicate that implementing the low-carbon city pilot policy in the location of the largest customer incentivizes suppliers to invest in innovation. Additionally, our research finds that financing constraints and market monopoly power moderate the supply chain innovation spillover. Interestingly, the impact of the policy is more pronounced among suppliers in high-carbon and low-tech sectors as well as those in the eastern region. © 2024, HARD Publishing Company.

Europe is dependant on other continents for the safe supply of rare earth elements as these are to date not mined in Europe. In order to circumvent the shortage of supply, the rare earth elements recycling, especially from End-of-Life (EoL) products are imperative. This article evaluated the feasibility of Estonia as viable REEs recycling hub in Europe via an environmental, social and governance risks evaluation model. The model assessed the pros and cons of Estonia‘s environmental, social and governance indicators, and concluded that Estonia is very suitable for the establishment of REEs recycling industry. The environmental indicators showed continuous improvement in environmental health. The Estonian education system is of excellent quality and has produced a highly skilled workforce over the past years. The country's economic indicators are good, management is transparent and business opportunities are diverse. The environmental, social and governance situations show that Estonia mostly meets the prerequisites for the establishment of a rare earth element recycling industry.

The formulation of a robust circularity strategy depends on a comprehensive assessment, which is closely related to the overarching goal of managing the transition to circularity. The initial phase of transition within the healthcare sector reinforces the need to seamlessly integrate CE principles. It is therefore imperative to define and carefully monitor indicators that will help assess and improve sustainability, operational efficiency, supply chain resilience and stakeholder satisfaction, including both consumers and patients. The primary objective of this research is to prioritize relevant performance indicators that will be critical in measuring the effectiveness of the transition to a circular economy within the healthcare supply chain. To achieve this objective, the study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established methodology known for its effectiveness in solving complex multi-criteria challenges. The AHP is used to prioritize performance indicators that facilitate the management of the circular economy transition in the healthcare supply chain. The focus is on improving the quality of care, optimizing delivery efficiency, and emphasizing environmental sustainability within the healthcare paradigm. The methodological framework includes the identification of key main criteria covering environmental, social, economic, and logistical dimensions. These criteria are further refined with the inclusion of 14 sub-criteria, resulting in a list of 16 key performance indicators (KPIs). Additionally, the study proposes an alternative business model advocating for the implementation of the Circular Supply Chain Operation Reference Model (circular SCOR). This model offers a perspective for rapid change in supply chain processes towards circular transition within the healthcare system. The final stage of the research involves verifying the results through sensitivity analysis and correlation mapping of the indicator results with the Circular SCOR model. This process helps organizations refine their performance measurement protocols, enhancing their capacity for effective evaluation and strategic decision-making within the circular economy framework. This comprehensive approach enables healthcare organizations to proactively contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future while maintaining a focus on quality care for patient well-being. © The Author(s) 2024.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Circular economy; Circular SCOR; Healthcare sector supply chain; Performance indicators","","K.N.

Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","collective outcomes; supply chain heterogeneity; supply chain interconnectedness; sustainability; transparency","Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Bloomberg; Collective outcome; Empirical studies; Extended supply chains; Large-scales; Levels of analysis; Material information; Supply chain heterogeneity; Supply chain interconnectedness; Supply chain structures; Transparency","J.

Aims and Methods: Here we assess (1) the global reach of TTLCs by mapping their tobacco growing and manufacturing subsidiaries and (2) the relationship between in-country presence of the tobacco industry and their power and interference. Data on subsidiaries were collated through systematic searching for countries’ supply chain activities in documents and web pages. Cross-sectional multiple regression analysis was used to assess the association between the number of agricultural and manufacturing TTLCs and the Tobacco Industry Interference score, and the degree to which these were mediated by tobacco control, good governance, and economic importance of tobacco. Results: TTLC supply chain activity had global reach. As the number of TTLCs with tobacco growing and manufacturing activities rose, interference increased significantly. Interference was associated with poorer tobacco control. The association with more TTLCs undertaking final product manufacturing was related to higher-value tobacco exports but was not related to tobacco making a bigger contribution to the economy. Conclusions: TTLCs continue to control the global tobacco supply chain through their globe-spanning subsidiaries. The presence of TTLCs in a country is associated with political interference. Countries should consider their participation in the tobacco supply chain alongside the understanding that they are likely to cede political power to TTLCs, potentially undermining the health of their populations. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Industry 5.0 is the most recent infrastructural revolution of industrial sector technology based on technologies like human–machine interaction, artificial intelligence, IoT, Big Data, collaborative robots, etc. This happened when the sector radically turned its global focus to sustainability and set many environmental goals to meet the requirements. In this research, the authors identified the synergy between Industry 5.0 and green supply chain management (GSCM) for achieving this target at RMG industries in Bangladesh. GSCM is well known for environmental concerns in traditional supply chain stages. For developing countries, the solution of a sustainable approach to counter waste and pollution-related issues is not adequate enough. A proper understanding of the digitalized industrial approach through Industry 5.0 will enable them to make efficient decisions regarding sustainable goal accomplishment and proper monitoring of the initiatives. This paper illustrates how I5.0 can integrate with GSCM. In this synergy, this study has identified 9 synergistic factors and analyzed the impact of each factor by using the interpretive structural modeling approach. By using level portioning, the factors are illustrated in 7 different levels, and MICMAC analysis is used to categorize them. This study offers a detailed exploration of the synergy between Industry 5.0 and GSCM, offering a practical framework that can guide industry stakeholders in implementing advanced technologies to achieve sustainable development in the RMG sector. © 2025 The Authors","Green Supply Chain Management; Industry 5.0; Man-machine Interaction; RMG Industry; Sustainable Development","","M.A. Amin; Division of Engineering Management and Decision Sciences, College of Science & Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, 34110, Qatar; email: mdal44149@hbku.edu.qa","English","Clean.

This complexity poses challenges for decision-makers who must integrate both qualitative and quantitative approaches, particularly in relation to digital energy business models. This study identifies key indicators for decision-making regarding digital energy business models and prioritizes alternatives from environmental, social, governance (ESG), and financial perspectives. Additionally, it incorporates activity-based costing techniques and resource constraints into the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. The study employs the decision-making trial and evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), the analytic network process (ANP), the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and zero–one goal programming (ZOGP) to optimize digital energy business model portfolios. The findings indicate that perspectives on environmental concern and governance practices significantly influence other dimensions. Furthermore, managing carbon footprint is crucial for evaluating digital energy business models. Specifically, optimal portfolios of digital energy business models—such as green energy experience communities, green energy resource-sharing platforms, asset activation innovative designs, and series connections with grid data demonstrate feasibility and reasonability in terms of resource requirement. This study offers insights into various MCDM approaches, emphasizing the importance of digital energy resource planning over traditional decision-making processes. It provides valuable scientific guidance for optimizing digital energy business model planning and contributes to the transformation of Taiwan's energy industry toward sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Activity-based life-cycle costing (ABLCC); Digital energy business model; Mathematical planning; Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); Resource requirement","","C.-H.

To analyze the heterogenous and non-linear effects, the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) and the Partially Linear Functional-Coefficient (PLFC) Model are utilized. The findings indicate significant variations, showing that ESG environmental performance favourably influences energy source diversification across all quantiles from 10 to 90 %. Non-linear results demonstrate that ESG environmental performance negatively affects energy source diversification when economic growth is between 7.39 per cent and 9.91 per cent; however, this relationship turns positive when economic growth surpasses 9.92 per cent, indicating that economic development is crucial in the relationship between ESG environmental performance and energy sources diversification. Overall, the marginal effect plots generated by both the MMQR and PLFC models illustrate that an increase of one unit in ESG environmental performance results in a rise in energy source diversification. Moreover, robustness check shows that ESG environmental performance enhances energy sources diversification at both upper and lower regimes of ESG environmental performance.

Investors are majorly focussing on ESG measures with financial incentives while making investment decisions. Empirical evidences indicate that firms disclosing ESG measures are likely to outperform others by reducing the risk and enhancing the economic performance, although the results may vary. ESG measures not only promote economic incentives but also encourage sustainable production through value accretive supply chain mechanism.

Studies have revealed positive or negative relationships between ESG disclosure and the EP of companies. However, fewer studies have explored the contents of EIs to know their effectiveness in EP. Therefore, this study investigated the EI contents and their correlation with EP disclosed in the ESG reports of 10 international construction firms. Through case studies, a total of 68 EIs were identified from 10 ESG reports and their corresponding EP values (PVs) were evaluated. Relevant studies were adopted to determine the levels of initiative (LI) and PV scores. The results indicate a positive and moderate correlation (ρ = 0.59) between LI and PV, which means EIs disclosed at higher content levels were correlated with improved EP. This finding encourages companies to ensure appropriate contents and effectiveness of EIs when adopting them, and helps stakeholders gauge a company’s efforts in reducing environmental impact. © 2025 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.","construction firm; Environmental initiative; environmental performance; ESG report","Environmental remediation; Case-studies; Construction firms; Content level; Environmental initiatives; Environmental performance; Environmental social governance report; High-content; International construction; Performance; Performance value; Environmental monitoring","C.Y.

A novel approach in this context involves replacing single-cell proteins based on residues, aiming to reduce reliance on animal protein. The paper has suggested a novel multi-level, multi-period, multi-product mixed-integer linear programming model to design an efficient single-cell protein supply chain network through recycling municipal solid waste and sewage. Seven recycling technologies are considered, and their capacities are optimized. The network investigation involves identifying the location and capacity of centers at each supply chain level, the production technology type used at these centers, and other logistics network management decisions like inventory level and material flow throughout network. The proposed model has been applied in a real case in Iran for a 20-year planning horizon. The production of additional by-products, including electricity, heat, and bio-fertilizer, is also studied. An extensive sensitivity analysis of key parameters, including demand, production center capacities, and costs related to feedstock and final product processing, is conducted. The research revealed that rail transportation was favored by 62% of respondents over road transportation. Furthermore, the study identified the medium capacity level as the most suitable, considering the high production volume, which constituted about 60% of the total output. The evaluation results emphasize the model's efficiency and performance, highlighting its potential to improve and optimize the single-cell proteins supply chain network. © 2025","Municipal solid waste; Optimization; Sewage; Single-cell protein; Supply chain","Integer linear programming; Integer programming; Waste management; Animal proteins; Environmental sustainability; Innovative strategies; Microbial proteins; Multilevels; Optimisations; Resources utilizations; Single cell proteins; Supply chain network; Sustainable resources; Municipal solid waste","R.

Emphasising the supplier-customer interaction, ‘Industry 5.0’ is technological revolution, which is a value-driven initiative that drives knowledge spillovers along the sustainable supply chain (SSC). In this context, enterprises are incorporating more GTI activities into their partners’ SSC strategies. This study employs samples of China's A-share listed companies covering the period from 2010 to 2021 to examine the spillover effects between customers’ GTI and suppliers total factor productivity (TFP). Both GTI and TFP indicators are important representations of ‘Industry 5.0’, with our major concerning on the enhancement of supplier's long-term orientation (LTO). We calculated TFP by the Olley-Pakes and Levinsohn-Petrin methods, dividing GTI indicators into three levels: substantial green technological innovation (SGTI), non-substantial green technological innovation (NGTI), and overall green technological innovation (OGTI). Our empirical results show that 1) Customer's GTI contributes to supplier's TFP, and supplier's LTO including environmental, social & governance (ESG) performance, and R&D input can strengthen this beneficial link; 2) customer's NGTI represents a significant differentiation in comparison with SGTI, where R&D investment weakens the positive relationship between customer's NGTI and supplier's TFP; 3) heterogeneity analysis indicates that the spillovers of customer's GTI on supplier's TFP are more pronounced among state-owned enterprises, high-tech enterprises, and non-polluting enterprises. Notably, the connectedness demonstrates dynamic patterns through 2SLS and GMM regressions, highlighting the importance of enterprises' SSC and LTO being the shock transmitters to their TFP. Our study is prone to benefit lawmakers, regulators, and firm executives responsible for analysing and assessing the SSC, providing more policy implications with future prospects for sustainable transformation in the upcoming ‘Industry 5.0’ era. © 2024 The Author(s)","Green technological innovation; Industry 5.0; Long-term orientation; Sustainable supply chain; Total factor productivity","","Q.

To address this gap, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 313 employees from five Chinese supply chain enterprises. Through factor analysis, this study identified four latent variables associated with environmental factors, three with social factors, and four with governance factors. A structural equation model was then developed to present a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of the three ESG dimensions and digital intelligence on SCR, while also examining the interplay among these ESG factors. The findings reveal that environmental factors positively influence SCR, whereas social and governance factors exert a negative impact. This study further observes that digital intelligence enhances ESG factors but does not directly influence SCR. These results underscore the intricate dynamics between ESG indicators, digital intelligence, and SCR, highlighting the imperative for supply chain entities to make balanced decisions.

This paper aims at overcoming these limitations of traditional rating systems by proposing an integrated model of supply chain rating, based on both financial and non-financial variables and including environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators to embrace a long-term orientation of value creation. Enlarging the scope of evaluation from the single company to its supply chain, we realize an integrated ESG–financial model which evaluates both financial and sustainability aspects of organizations, based on the supply chain they belong to. This model is especially useful for evaluating the potential growth of small and medium enterprises which, differently from large corporations, are usually more opaque to financial markets, and present lower disclosure intensity. Therefore, this measurement system can be adopted by both financial institutions, to evaluate potential borrowers, and individual companies, to make internal assessments or to evaluate the performance of their downstream and upstream partners. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ESG indicators; supply chain finance; supply chain management; supply chain performance measurement; supply chain quality management; supply chain rating; sustainable supply chain management","","D.

After an extensive literature review, four research questions were formulated and a questionnaire designed. From its distribution, 152 responses were collected from the textile industry. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to determine the most effective factors that could contribute to the evaluation of extensive aspects of sustainability in MtSCs as well as recognize the importance of constructs. The categorized constructs based on their importance included “Environmental issues”, “Economic issues”, “Policy and governance”, “Participation”, “Social issues”, “Transparency” and “Leadership and support”. A comprehensive rating for evaluating sustainability by indicating a readiness score and linguistic variables for each construct was developed in the form of a “fuzzy expert system”. The developed fuzzy expert system was applied in an Iranian textile company to assess its readiness status as a case application. The results indicated that the company had the highest and lowest readiness in “Transparency” and “Environmental issues” with total readiness scores of 2.65 and 0.17 respectively. The finding recommends that the company should pay more attention to environmental issues such as making a cutback on utility consumption and increasing recycled materials. The framework's validity was measured around 90% based on the satisfaction of experts' judgments, which enables the framework to be applied in different industrial settings. Theoretically, the findings contribute to the Resources-Based View (RBV) theory, with a focus on the sustainability of MtSCs, by unveiling a comprehensive set of factors for assessing sustainability and recognizing external and internal strategic resources that lead firms to sustainable competitive advantages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging economy; Exploratory factor analysis; Fuzzy inference engine; Multi-tier suppliers; Resources-based view theory; Sustainability","Competition; Environmental protection; Factor analysis; Fuzzy inference; Multivariant analysis; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Supply chains; Textiles; Transparency; Emerging economies; Empirical studies; Environmental issues; Factors analysis; Fuzzy inference engines; Fuzzy-expert systems; Hybrid approach; Multi-tier; Multi-tier supplier; Resource-based view theory; Sustainable development","J.A.

The information on ESG scores is valuable for understanding whether companies are explicitly considering ESG targets, developing plans to incorporate these targets into their businesses, and assessing to what extent the companies successfully reach these targets. In fact, the higher the ESG score, the better the company’s performance should be with respect to ESG targets. The explicit incorporation of ESG targets could lead towards transitioning to sustainable and socially responsible businesses capable of dealing with grand societal challenges. While ESG has been mostly explored from an investor’s point of view, this structured review takes a company’s perspective. By analysing the citation network using CitNetExplorer, two important managerial trends are identified: 1) the characteristics of CEOs and their boards affect ESG disclosure and performance; 2) ESG disclosure influences access to debt financing, cost of capital, and financial performance.

We examine data for the companies in the 2020 and 2022 Fortune Global 500 and find that corporate definitions of diversity are dynamic and vary across regions. Furthermore, while supplier diversity efforts are not yet widespread, these initiatives are increasingly common, especially in the form of references to diversity in companies’ supplier codes of conduct. Companies in North America and in certain economic sectors, such as the financial and healthcare sectors, are more likely to have such efforts in place. Based on our data, companies that report on their internal diversity and companies that have other forms of supplier sustainability initiatives are also more likely to have supplier diversity initiatives. We argue further that supplier diversity efforts will follow a trajectory similar to other supplier sustainability efforts. Finally, we suggest possible avenues for future research on supplier diversity. © The Author(s) 2024.","DEI; social sustainability; supplier diversity; supply chain management","","A.

While carbon neutrality has gained prominence, our study argues that achieving carbon neutrality alone is not enough to address climate change effectively, as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) are potent contributors to global warming. Design/methodology/approach: We used multiple databases, including EBSCO, ProQuest, Science Direct, Emerald and Google Scholar, to identify articles related to climate neutrality in the context of non-CO2 gases. A total of 71 articles in environmental science, climate change, energy systems, agriculture and logistics are reviewed to provide insights into the climate neutrality of supply chains. Findings: We find that, in addition to CO2, other GHG such as methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and fluorinated gases also significantly contribute to climate change. Our literature review identified several key pillars for achieving net-zero GHG emissions, including end-use efficiency and electrification, clean electricity supply, clean fuel supply, “GHG capture, storage and utilization,” enhanced land sinks, reduced non-CO2 emissions and improved feed and manure management. Originality/value: We contribute to the literature on climate neutrality of supply chains by emphasizing the significance of non-CO2 GHG along with CO2 and highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to climate neutrality in addressing climate change. This study advances the understanding of climate neutrality of supply chains and contributes to the discourse on effective climate change mitigation strategies.

In a world where increasing pressure from stakeholders has led to an intense level of attention towards sustainable supply chain practices, both scholars and practitioners have sparked the debate surrounding ESG scores and performance of supply chains. Given the novelty of the topic, along with its significance for both academia and industry, we performed a systematic literature review with the goal of synthesizing extant knowledge and providing a structured research agenda to further expand the field. We found a lively stream of research, notably focused on the need for transparency in supply chain management, the pivotal role of policymakers in driving the ESG agenda forward and the impact of ESG in the supply chain performance. In addition to providing a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of the current state of the art, with the aid of bibliometric data, we provide useful recommendations for future research by developing a structured research agenda and a theoretical framework, synthesizing extant knowledge and covering notable research gaps. The work has implications for both theory and practice. Theoretically, the research agenda acts as a starting point for further research in the field, while simultaneously providing scholars with a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the art. From a practical perspective, the review highlights the role of managers and policymakers in implementing the ESG framework in supply chains, along with its challenges, benefits and potential drawbacks, thus acting as an informative point of reference for such implementation. © 2023 The Authors","ESG; Supply chain; Sustainable development; Systematic literature review","Supply chain management; 'current; Environmental, social and governance; Management research; Performance; Policy makers; Research agenda; State of the art; Sustainable supply chains; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Sustainable development","E.

The authors propose hypotheses about the impact of buying companies SSCM activities on the inflicted damage by unexpected supply chain disruptions and the recovery time afterwards and test these empirically using data from companies during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate a sample of 231 of the largest publicly traded companies in the European Union with 4.158 firm-year observations. For the analysis, the authors generate variables capturing the companies’ intensity and years of experience of their SSCM activities targeted at the supply chain and run regression analyses on the inflicted damage due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery time after the disruption. Findings: Buying companies’ SSCM activities have a positive effect on their SCRES. The damage inflicted by unexpected supply chain disruptions is lower when companies have higher levels of SSCM and longer experience with it. The recovery time afterwards is significantly reduced by longer experience with SSCM efforts. Research limitations/implications: The authors suggest SCRES is reinforced by transparency, situational awareness, social capital and collaboration resulting from companies SSCM activities translate into increased SCRES. Practical implications: The authors show that companies with superior SSCM are more resilient in a crisis and conclude that, therefore, companies should invest in SSCM to prevent future supply disruptions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study analyzing a data set of multi-industry companies, linking their SSCM activities to SCRES during the pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Damage control; Disruptions; Environmental management; Recovery time; Resilience; Supply chain; Sustainability; Sustainable management","","J.

Amongst this criticism, Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to the industrialized agri-food supply systems. In recent years there have been some attempts to explore the relationship between SFSCs and sustainability, but these are mostly theoretical discussions and lacks empirical validation. This study, therefore, attempts to provide empirical validation of the SFSCs and sustainability linkages. Additionally, from the theoretical perspective, our work extends the traditional triple bottom line constructs and explores two extra dimensions of sustainability in the food supply chain system, namely, governance and culture, thus exploring five dimensions of sustainability. Furthermore, while SFSCs have proven to improve farmers’ livelihoods and reconnect producers with consumers, little or no attention has been given to understand the consumers' attitudes towards the SFSC practices. Therefore, this study aims to explore the customers’ attitudes towards participating in SFSCs through the concept of a moral economy and personal relationship. Based on the 532 valid responses from Chinese consumers, our study shows that all five pillars of sustainability, moral economy and Chinese relationship have a positive influence on consumers’ participation in SFSCs. With its intuitive benefits, the economic pillar emerged as the most approved factor by the participants.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses econometric modeling and regressions as its methodology. The baseline results were obtained through feasible generalized least squares and Driscoll–Kraay estimation procedures, and robustness tests were applied afterward to ensure the results’ validity. Findings: For the main outputs, after applying econometric methods, the adoption of ISO 9000 series model certificates in all categories considered by the index foments the development of CGI. The same positive coefficient is observed for the second hypothesis, confirming the assumption that adopting environmental management systems such as ISO 14001 supports CGI. Adopting internal good practices programs such as Six Sigma, Lean, Lean Six Sigma, total quality management and others positively influences Brazilian CGI. Originality/value: These results are important for both public and private policymakers, managers, shareholders and general stakeholders alike because they provide significant insights regarding the mechanisms and elements that support the development of CGI. The outputs are also relevant to the director boards of the companies so that they can be used as inputs to discuss and set strategic goals, as well as plan long-term courses of action to embed in processes and practices ways of developing CGI. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Econometric modeling; Environment; Management control systems; Organizational performance","","V.M.

In addition, buying firms cannot optimize the performance of the whole supply chain because the supplier sustainability practices are unobservable to them and to the public. These two challenges lead to the occurrence of several environmental and social scandals. These scandals pose serious economic and reputational consequences to supply chain members, especially buying firms. Given these challenges and using a sequential game-theoretic methodology, our contribution to the literature on supplier sustainability is to address the effects of supplier code of conduct (SCC) programs on different performance indicators of supply chains. Our analyses indicated that (a) an SCC program can mitigate the supply chain performance deficiencies created by the lack of the integrated optimization of the whole supply chain. Moreover, an SCC program can be superior to some common auditing programs initiated by buying firms. (b) In cases that the supplier’s capability is low or moderate, an SCC program provides a Pareto improvement in its sustainability level and the buying firm’s profit. (c) High consumer awareness threatens the buying firm’s survival in the market. Given this threat, an SCC program indirectly enhances the buying firm’s potential to survive. (d) Buying firms should lower their suppliers’ wholesale prices in exchange for a substantial investment in their suppliers’ capabilities, irrespective of whether or not an SCC program is initiated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buyer–supplier relationship; Code of conduct; Game theory; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Consumer Behavior; Investments; design method; game theory; investment; optimization; supply chain management; sustainability; consumer attitude; investment","H.

The ESG score has been disaggregated into three sub-parts, i.e., EDS, GDS, and SDS (environmental, social, and governance disclosure scores, respectively). Using a sample of 305 companies listed in the NSE 500 (the largest stock exchange in India), linear and non-linear relationships among the variables have been investigated. The data has been compiled from 2014 to 2022 since the Indian government implemented the CSR mandate from the year 2014. The linear results of the dynamic panel data analysis technique have indicated that ESG disclosures significantly impact the market performance of business enterprises. Further, the non-linear results have indicated a U-shaped association between the composite ESG score and market performance. The disintegration of ESG score has revealed that while the social and governance components have a positive linear relationship with all performance indicators, the environmental sub-component has a U-shaped relationship with market performance. Hence, as the findings indicate that ESG-related activities impact firms positively after reaching a threshold, long-term planning and substantial resources are required to be dedicated in this direction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","And governance (ESG); Corporate performance; Environmental; Non-linearity; Panel data analysis; Social","Commerce; Data handling; Information analysis; And governance (environmental social governance); Corporate performance; Environmental; Market performance; Non linear; Non-linearity; Panel data analysis; Performance; Social; U-shaped; Disintegration","T.N.

Drawing on the legitimacy theory, we explore whether ESG and diversity scores predict global companies' carbon emission scores. As concerns about the environmental impact of businesses grow, understanding the relationships between ESG performance, diversity management, and carbon emissions becomes imperative for sustainable corporate practices.

Our research resulted in the final sample, which includes 627 worldwide firm data from 2021. Data regarding all publicly traded companies was obtained from Refinitiv Eikon. Findings: Our findings showed that corporate carbon emission performance in global corporations is influenced by ESG performance and total diversity score.

While past studies have explored this connection, they often faced challenges in quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of CSR initiatives. However, advancements in research methodologies and the development of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) measurement dimensions have led to the creation of more robust evaluation criteria. These criteria use ESG scores as primary reference indicators for assessing the effectiveness of CSR activities. This study aims to utilize ESG indicators from the ESG InfoHub website of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) as benchmarks, comprising 15 items from the environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) dimensions to form the CSR effectiveness indicators and predict financial performance. The data cover the years 2021–2022 for listed companies, using return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) as measures of financial performance. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, the applications of machine learning and deep learning (DL) have proliferated across many fields. However, the use of machine learning to analyze ESG data remains rare. Therefore, this study employs machine learning models to predict financial performance based on ESG performance, utilizing both classification and regression approaches. Numerical results indicate that two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), outperform other models in regression and classification tasks, respectively. Consequently, deep learning techniques prove to be feasible, effective, and efficient alternatives for predicting corporations’ financial performance based on ESG metrics. © 2025 by the authors.","corporate social responsibility (CSR); deep learning; ESG; machine learning; prediction","","P.-F.

Using 10 years of panel data across resource-intensive, consumer-facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource-intensive, consumer-facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry-specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector-specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID-19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies. However, the moderating effect of COVID-19 on this relationship was not significant, indicating limited variation in the ESG–ROA dynamics during the pandemic period except in the governance model. These findings suggest that tailored ESG strategies, aligned with industry-specific challenges, can optimize financial performance. Policymakers and investors are encouraged to focus on sector-specific ESG practices to better evaluate company performance and formulate effective regulations.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating sentiment analysis, topic modeling, clustering, causal loop analysis and ethnography to examine ESG-related content on social media. Analyzing social media data, study identified key themes and derived ten propositions about ESG investing. Industry professionals, financial advisors and investors further validated these findings through expert interviews. Combining data-driven analysis and qualitative insights provides a comprehensive understanding of how social media shapes investor preferences and decision-making in the ESG domain. Findings: Environmental aspects, such as conservation, preservation of natural resources, renewable and clean energy, biodiversity, restoration and eco-friendly products and technologies, shape attitudes toward ESG investing. Social considerations, including inclusivity, diversity, social justice, human rights, stakeholder engagement, transparency, community development and philanthropy, significantly influence ESG investing sentiments. Governance elements such as transparency, accountability, ethical governance, compliance, risk management, regulatory compliance and responsible leadership also play a pivotal role in shaping ESG investing opinions. Practical implications: This study presents actionable insights for policymakers and organizations by identifying key constructs in ESG investing and proposing an integrated framework that includes mediating factors like resource efficiency and stakeholder engagement alongside moderating elements such as regulatory environment and investor preferences. Policymakers should establish standardized ESG reporting frameworks, incentivize sustainable practices and use social media data for regulatory purposes. For businesses, integrating social media insights into decision-making can enhance ESG communication strategies and accountability. These measures will foster greater transparency, strengthen investor relations and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive global economy. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study to investigate improving ESG investing preferences based on big data mined from social media platforms. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ESG issues; Investor perceptions; Machine learning; Netnography; Social media","","A.K.

Under the guidance of the theory of sustainable development, the ESG (Environmental Social Governance) goals in the social aspect are realized through digital technology in the storage field. In the picking process of warehousing, efficient and accurate cargo identification is the premise to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of intelligent robot operation. According to the driving and grasping methods of different robot arms, the image recognition model of arbitrarily shaped objects is established by using a convolution neural network (CNN) on the basis of simulating a human hand grasping objects. The model updates the loss function value and global step size by exponential decay and moving average, realizes the identification and classification of goods, and obtains the running dynamics of the program in real time by using visual tools. In addition, combined with the different characteristics of the data set, such as shape, size, surface material, brittleness, weight, among others, different intelligent grab solutions are selected for different types of goods to realize the automatic picking of goods of any shape in the picking list.

Although some companies have responded to reputational pressure by taking nominal steps to improve working conditions, such as enacting supplier codes of conduct, those efforts have not led to significant change. Because voluntary efforts have thus far been ineffective, victims have pursued domestic litigation against MNCs to compensate their losses and encourage future reform. In the recent case of Nestlé USA, Inc. v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court cut off one popular avenue for such suits, the Alien Tort Statute, leaving plaintiffs with little ability to sue under federal law. State law tort claims, however, are a strong alternative. Plaintiffs can argue, and indeed have argued in one federal circuit court case, that MNCs have undertaken a duty of care to them as third-party beneficiaries of their supplier codes of conduct. This Note argues that plaintiffs making this claim should point to analogous cases in construction law, where courts have often found that design professionals overseeing a construction site have a duty of care towards their contractors' employees. In analyzing construction law cases, this Note draws out five factors that have influenced courts to find liability. Future plaintiffs suing for labor violations should use these factors to show that MNCs owed them a duty of care under their supplier codes of conduct and may therefore be held liable for labor rights violations in their international supply chains. © 2022 University of Virginia.

Our results show that ESG performance increases the quantity and quality of corporate GI by 2.72% and 3.20%, respectively. These significant positive effects are consistent across three ESG sub-ratings and a series of robustness tests, such as the instrumental variable (IV) test based on Confucian culture intensity. Mechanism analysis reveals that ESG performance positively affects corporate GI through the resource effect, governance effect, and innovation effect. Additionally, the GI impact of ESG performance is more pronounced in large, young, growing, and mature enterprises, enterprises in clean and low-carbon industries, and those located in key environmental protection (KEP) and two control zones (TCZ) cities.

This was one of the first empirical studies to integrate the institutional theory with the resource-based view and thereby demonstrate that ESG factors had a significant role in contributing to institutional isomorphic behaviour, in the form of sustainable innovation as a strategy. This study established the importance of ESG factors in defining the sustainability agenda of multinational life sciences organisations. Lastly, the study elucidates the benefits of the integration of sustainability as a strategy in multinational life sciences corporations. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ESG; Innovation output; Institutional isomorphism; Institutional theory; Resource-based view; Sustainability as a strategy; Sustainable innovation","","B.

The panel data was attained through Thomson Reuters Eikon Database for 1491 firms from ten countries from 2014-2018. The empirical model was tested by two dynamic panel data methods: Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on all four dimensions of social sustainability. There is also a positive and significant relationship between cultural diversity and three dimensions of social sustainability: workforce, community, and product responsibility.

This study aims to examine the integration of ESG into the currently prevailing business model. Twenty-nine studies were systematically reviewed. Our analysis used an input–process–output model to identify the integration process and the outcomes. The findings show that only two papers explain the implementation steps or transition process of ESG integration, while 27 papers discuss ESG integration as an outcome, including integration behaviors, advantages, practices, and critical views. Our research aims to highlight that firms adopt ESG as a response to pressure from financial markets rather than as a serious effort to integrate sustainability into their core operations. We state the need for more research into the integration process to motivate firms to reform their business models, foster sustainability, and enhance financial performance. © 2022 by the authors.

However, inconsistent results remain a research gap and thus need to be re-examined. By drawing on stakeholder theory and the neoclassical economics perspective while using the panel data of 155 Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2020, system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation results revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between ESG and CFP. Moreover, by drawing on the institutional-based view, it was determined that government subsidies moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship between ESG and CFP. Specifically, we found that the inverted U-shaped effect of ESG on CFP is weakened when government subsidies are high. This study contributes to the literature by confirming the presence of a curvilinear relationship between ESG and CFP. This study also generates meaningful implications suggesting that the governmental role in ESG is salient in mitigating associated financial costs for firms, thereby ultimately affecting CFP. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Corporate financial performance (CFP); Emerging economies; Environmental, social, and governance (ESG); Government subsidies","","X.

Businesses that act on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters can attain a competitive advantage. ESG has become necessary in the agricultural sector as agribusinesses are considered high-impact companies. The lack of uniformity in reporting guidelines leads to inconsistent and overloading of information. The objective of this paper is to conduct an evaluation and comparison of the current ESG reporting practices of listed agribusinesses in South Africa, Australia, and Chile. To support the quality and quantity of reporting, the concept of materiality is addressed by recognising what is material to be disclosed to stakeholders. The study evaluates how agribusinesses have incorporated the proposed material topics of the new GRI 13 sector standard into their current reporting practices. A qualitative content analysis was done to identify the presence or absence of the 34 proposed material topics in their reports. The findings indicate a distinct lack of harmonisation in the agri-food sector disclosures. Topics hardly mentioned included the rights of indigenous people, living income, and climate adaptation. Low disclosures of the keywords Climate adaptation with 3.3% and Climate resilience with 7.0% on average, for all three countries, were reported. It is recommended that the newly proposed GRI 13 sector standard must be implemented as companies can seize this opportunity for increased transparency and gain a strategic advantage. Emphasis on the materiality concept is needed as it connects with the stakeholder theory to disclose only important information. © 2023 The Authors.

In response to the increasing demand of investors and regulators for non-financial information, listed companies have paid attention to publishing ESG reports consisting of environmental, social, and governance information. Listed companies are increasingly required to provide high-quality information that is clear and comparable. However, the lack of incentive to listed companies makes it hard to improve the quality of ESG disclosure, and the cost of ESG disclosure leads to the uncontrollable quality of ESG reports and may even manipulation by opportunistic behaviors. In this paper, we illustrate the moral hazard problem in ESG disclosure from the perspective of investors and listed companies, in which the effort level for listed companies to provide high-quality ESG report cannot be observed by investors. Then we propose a blockchain-based incentive mechanism for ESG disclosure from a principal-agent perspective to improve the information quality of ESG disclosure, where investors act as principal and listed companies act as agents. Token in blockchain technology is utilized as the rewards to improve the listed companies' reputation, thus increasing their chance of being promoted to investors for preferential investment opportunities in the blockchain platform. We then design the first-best (FB) and second-best (SB) optimal contracts based on classic principal-agent model to overcome the moral hazard problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the incentive mechanism. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, the heterogeneous impact of different dimensions of ESG performance on idiosyncratic risk (IR) remains unclear. Drawing upon the stakeholder theory, this study investigates the differing impacts of separate E, S, and G performance on IR, as well as the contingency role of political ties. Using a dataset of 2436 Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2019, the empirical results indicate that S and G performance significantly mitigate IR, and these linear negative relationships are enhanced by political ties. Surprisingly, the linear effect of E performance on IR is not significant, but the post-hoc analysis reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between E performance and IR. More importantly, this curvilinear linkage is steeper for firms with political ties. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that firms with the chief executive officer (CEO) duality make the effects of E, S, and G performance on IR insignificant. This study extends the growing literature on ESG and risk management, guiding firms to develop differentiated ESG investment strategies and offering actionable insights for firms to better benefit from their ESG performance. © The Author(s) 2025.","","","J.

As a pivotal criterion for measuring green development, green total factor productivity (GTFP) refers to maximizing output while minimizing the environmental pollution for the required input production factors. Existing research neglects the impact of ESG ratings on GTFP that indicates the balance between economic growth and ecological protection. This study examines the impact of ESG ratings and mechanisms on GTFP using a sample of Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms between 2010 and 2021. The findings indicate that ESG ratings promote corporate GTFP, a result which remains robust after a series of robustness tests. The mechanism analysis reveals that ESG ratings improve corporate GTFP by alleviating financial constraints, mitigating managerial myopia, and enhancing supply chain efficiency. A moderating analysis verified that managerial power weakens the positive impact of ESG ratings on corporate GTFP. The positive effect of ESG ratings on GTFP is more pronounced among non-state-owned firms and firms in non-heavily polluting and highly competitive industries. This study confirms that ESG ratings can achieve the benefits of productivity growth, energy conservation, and pollution reduction at the micro-enterprise level, offering a policy foundation for promoting ESG disclosure and achieving green development. © 2024 by the authors.","ESG ratings; financial constraints; green total factor productivity; managerial myopia; managerial power; supply chain efficiency","corporate social responsibility; environmental issue; environmental protection; financial provision; industrial regulation; manufacturing; rating curve; reduction; supply chain management; total factor productivity","S.

The paper aims to measure ESG disclosure by Indian companies and the perspective of stakeholders. To meet the research objectives and understand the stakeholder perspective on the three ESG disclosure norms, and ESG reporting including environmental factors, social factors and governance factors on 10 aspects, the data from 569 individuals were collected from accountants, managers, employees, investors, and other beneficiaries in different parts of India. The data were analysed using multiple regression techniques to determine whether stakeholders’ perspectives were met and achieved widespread recognition of the inclusion of ESG disclosures and sustainability enhancements. As a result, it was discovered that the cost of disclosing information should be as low as possible to support businesses dedicated to ESG reporting and sustainability. However, the attraction of working for organizations that are good stewards of the environment and society serves to increase interest in ESG reporting among other stakeholders, such as employees. The relevance of the study is that it provides an outcome that the corporation should invest in new technology or platforms to provide more timely data and high-quality disclosure processes for ESG disclosure practices. © 2024 The Authors.","Environmental; ESG Disclosure; Governance; Integrated Reporting; Social","","","English","Corp.

As social and environmental issues increase, firms are advocating the need to be more sustainable. However, in this scenario, corporate controversies still persist, and an analysis of their causes is required. This study focuses on establishing the relationship between financial constraints (FC) and ESG controversies and on determining whether the country context might modify the controversial behaviours of financially constrained firms. Through a Tobit analysis for panel data—and using a sample of firms with headquarters in 47 countries—our results show a positive and significant influence of FC on ESG controversies. In addition, our evidence confirms that country context impacts relationships within the firm, and that opting for controversial activities is increasingly less viable for firms located in countries where there is institutionalized sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s).

The heterogeneity of the top management team (TMT) significantly influences the direction and effectiveness of both ESG performance and corporate green innovation. Drawing on upper echelon theory, information decision-making theory, and social categorization theory, this paper conducts an empirical study using a sample of 314 manufacturing enterprises and employs multiple linear regression analysis to uncover the impact of TMT heterogeneity on corporate green innovation and the mediating role of ESG performance. The findings from this research suggest that TMT heterogeneity exerts a notable positive influence on green innovation (including green technological innovation and green product innovation), and that ESG performance plays a partial mediating role between TMT heterogeneity and green innovation.

Furthermore, while supplier diversity efforts are not yet widespread, these initiatives are increasingly common, especially in the form of references to diversity in companies’ supplier codes of conduct. Companies in North America and in certain economic sectors, such as the financial and healthcare sectors, are more likely to have such efforts in place. Based on our data, companies that report on their internal diversity and companies that have other forms of supplier sustainability initiatives are also more likely to have supplier diversity initiatives. We argue further that supplier diversity efforts will follow a trajectory similar to other supplier sustainability efforts.

Firstly, the relationships among venture capital, enterprise performance, and supply chain integration are analyzed, and the positive impacts of optimization and innovation of supply chain technology and venture capital on enterprise performance improvement are discussed. Secondly, the edge computing and blockchain technology are adopted to optimize the supply chain, and a protocol model is established to improve the security of supply chain information transmission. In addition, the supply chain Internet of Things (IoT) system is designed in layers based on blockchain and edge computing technology. Finally, the designed protocol model is applied to the supply chain and the supplier performance is evaluated by using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). The results show that the gas value of the designed protocol model is stable at 104,000∼116,000 in blockchain transactions, and the execution time of a single blockchain transaction fluctuates between 4,300 and 6,100 ms. Therefore, the designed protocol model can effectively ensure the security of supply chain data during the transmission. The evaluation results of supplier performance suggest that the cooperative relationship between venture capital enterprises and suppliers is affected by many factors. Optimizing the supply chain structure and production activities can improve the performance of suppliers and venture capital enterprises.

Thus, implementing ESG might assist firms in Malaysia to improve their corporate performance. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of ESG on corporate performance in terms of the value of Malaysian listed firms. A total of 45 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia that have complete ESG data from 2011–2021 were selected from Bloomberg’s ESG database. Corporate value was measured using three indicators – return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin’s Q. According to the results, the ESG scores have an insignificant positive influence on ROE and Tobin’s Q. However, the ESG scores have a negative but insignificant impact on ROA. The individual Environmental score has a negative impact on ROA but a positive impact on ROE and Tobin’s Q. Meanwhile, Social on its own has an insignificant negative impact on all variables, and Governance has a positive but insignificant impact on all variables. Based on the inconsistencies between the results of this study and those of previous research, the conclusions on whether ESG criteria promote business value and performance cannot be reached. ESG practices have become increasingly important, not only for policymakers but for governments and stakeholders. Hence, the outcome of this study will be useful for the government to reduce costs and implement policies to improve corporate performance in Malaysia. © 2023 AESS Publications.

This study employs, for the first time, the grounded theory (GT) methodology to investigate how sustainability is “perceived” and “practiced” by the entrepreneurs of the Italian poultry supply chain. The results provide insights into how changes toward greater sustainability can be transformed into concrete pathways that function within the organizational design. The outcome could be the reconfiguration of the organizational design, whereby the practice becomes incisive, or its circumvention, whereby the practice is adopted only superficially. The development of a more standardized ESG reporting system, along with incentivization measures and policies supporting small and medium-sized agrifood companies in the adoption of sustainability practices, could contribute to overcoming the “detachment” between the sustainability “perceived” and “practiced” by agrifood companies and to effectively adopting environmental sustainability as a development strategy. © 2022 by the authors.","ESG; greenwashing; grounded theory; poultry sector; sustainability practices","Italy; development strategy; green economy; management practice; policy approach; supply chain management; sustainability","M.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical research evidence on how firms’ DESG practices impact customers’ attitudes and brand equity. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the effect of DESG initiatives on customers’ attitudes (CA) and brand equity (BE), and (2) to explore how those impacts vary based on the diversity of socio-economic attributes. An online survey was conducted, and the data were analyzed by a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Based on 212 samples of Thai citizens’ experiences with firms’ DESG initiatives, the results revealed that DESG has a significant positive direct effect on CA. The mediation analysis revealed that CA fully mediated the relationship between DESG and BE. The results of a second-order confirmatory factor analysis of the DESG construct found that the digital social dimension (b = 0.775) played the strongest role in explaining DESG, followed by the digital environmental (b = 0.768) and digital governance (b = 0.718) dimensions. The moderation analysis found that the impact of DESG on CA was stronger for younger groups than older populations. Additionally, the group with a higher formal education level seemed to exhibit higher levels of CA than those with a lower level. Our study is one of a few endeavors to clarify the effects of DESG from the customer’s side, and suggests several implications and recommendations. © 2022 by the authors.","brand equity; customer attitude; DESG; Thailand","Thailand; business; factor analysis; numerical model; public attitude; socioeconomic impact","S.

Design/methodology/approach: Using an integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach, this study uses rough stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (R-SWARA) to determine the weights of ESG factors, followed by the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method to assess the sustainability performance of five major commercial banks. This study involves insights from 15 experts in the banking sector, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of ESG integration. Findings: The research reveals that governance is the most significant ESG factor in the banking sector, followed by social and environmental factors.

Analyzing the relationship between ESG performance and two-way FDI behavior can guide companies towards adopting green and open practices. This study covers the period from 2009 to 2022, focusing on 2022 listed companies using unbalanced panel data with 13,365 observations. The results establish that a company's ESG performance significantly contributes to its two-way FDI behavior. Endogeneity analysis and robustness checks are consistent with the baseline regression findings. Non-state owned enterprises, large companies, and non-high-tech companies particularly benefit from ESG performance in their two-way FDI behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic likely amplified the significance of ESG factors in the decision-making process for two-way FDI behavior. Mechanism analysis indicates that ESG performance promotes innovation and efficiency, enhancing companies' ownership advantage. Additionally, ESG performance could enhance companies' reputation and bring information symmetry advantages. The study presents evidence that ESG performance acts as a substitute for digital transformation in driving companies' two-way FDI behavior. These three mechanisms contribute to a greater likelihood of two-way FDI behavior. These findings are of significant importance to both businesses and policymakers, guiding companies toward adopting more environmentally friendly and open practices, thereby promoting sustainable development and fostering growth in two-way FDI. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","and governance performance; Digital transformation; Environmental; Information symmetry; Ownership advantage; Social; Two-way foreign direct investment","Decision making; Investments; Sustainable development; And governance performance; Digital transformation; Environmental; Foreign direct investments; Information symmetries; Ownership advantage; Performance; Social; Two ways; Two-way foreign direct investment; Digital storage","Z.

However, few studies have analyzed in depth the mechanisms of ESG impact on green total factor productivity (green TFP). Here, we explored the impact of ESG performance on green TFP, green technical efficiency, and green technological progress using A-share listed companies in China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2011 to 2021. The results show that good ESG performance can significantly improve the green TFP of enterprises, and that this effect is more prominent in industries with lower environmental risks and enterprises in the growth and maturity stages. We identified the importance of the psychological account path and propose that the promotional effect of ESG performance on green TFP mainly derives from improving green technical efficiency, rather than from expanding green technological boundaries. These findings have practical implications for guiding companies to implement ESG concepts, strengthening the synergistic role of government regulation and professional supervision, and promoting micro-level implementation of innovation-driven and sustainable development strategies, thereby promoting high-quality development. © 2024 Niu, Wang.","","Carbon; China; Drive; Government Regulation; Industry; carbon; Article; business ethics; computer model; data collection method; decision making; diffusion of innovation; ecosystem resilience; environmental social and governance performance; expanding technological boundary; feedback system; government; green transformation strategies for enterprise; human; income security; interpersonal communication; lifestyle; outcome variable; process optimization; psychology; quality control; quality of life; social support; technical efficiency; technology; China; drive; government regulation; industry","D.

However, since incorporating a large number of environmental and social governance measures into corporate business strategies will affect a company's short-term financial performance, it is difficult for ESG strategies to gain the decision-making support of the board of directors. Female board representation, on the other hand, can address the above-mentioned challenges by virtue of their acumen in environmental subsidies and their pro-environmental market image. Nevertheless, the existing literature has not recognized the advantages of female board representation in these two aspects. Based on this, drawing on the Upper Echelons Theory and Gender Socialization Theory, this paper takes the listed companies on China's stock markets from 2014 to 2022 as a sample and uses a fixed effects model to analyze the impact of female board representation (FBR) on ESG. The research findings show that when there are two or three female board members, it significantly improves ESG performance. Secondly, from the perspective of the institutional environment, environmental subsidies amplify the positive impact of FBR on ESG. However, market competition has the opposite effect and may even offset the positive impact of environmental subsidies. The heterogeneity analysis further reveals that FBR has a greater positive impact on the ESG performance of companies in non-critical industries and those that have established environmental committees. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","environmental committees; environmental subsidy; ESG; female board representation; market competition","","B.

To ease the burdens of conducting sustainability studies, especially life cycle assessments (LCA), practitioners may consider integrating large language models (LLM) into LCAs. This emerging application may offer some advantages due to the capability of these models to generate and process text quickly and efficiently, decreasing the time it takes to complete an LCA and increasing the accessibility of LCAs. In this perspective, we assess the ability of LLMs to complete LCA tasks and encourage the LCA community to study the potential strategies for enhancing the integration of LLMs in LCA methodologies and collaborate to develop standards for responsible use. Because of these advantages, LLMs show promise for life cycle inventory data collection and interpreting the life cycle impact assessment. Challenges arise primarily from the inclusion of hallucinations in the content generated by the LLM, which can be mitigated if the LCA practitioner uses prompt engineering techniques. Moreover, the risk that models cannot take responsibility for generated content can be ameliorated by having the LCA practitioner carefully review the LLM output and take responsibility for decisions made based on the generated content. So long as appropriate steps are taken to overcome the challenges and risks of using of LLMs for LCA, the opportunities presented by integrating the generative AI models can streamline the LCA process and result in significant benefits for the LCA practitioner. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental social governance goals; Large language models; Life cycle assessment; Multi-modal models; Sustainability","Computational linguistics; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Environmental social governance goal; Language model; Large language model; Life cycle assessment; Modal models; Multi-modal; Multi-modal model; Sustainable cities; Sustainable communities; Wicked problems; Life cycle","F.

Although numerous studies have investigated the impact of ESG scores on financial returns and the trend in ESG investment strategies, only a limited number of studies have attempted to capture the key players in ESG investment. Therefore, to determine the most influential investors in the ESG investment field, the cumulative impacts are calculated based on the ESG scores of invested companies, the total market price of invested companies, and the investor history portfolio report.

Our sample comprises 148 European companies belonging to the Euro Stoxx index in the period 2009–2014. For high-innovation companies (HICs), we find positive relationships between some Social (S) issues and CFP and weaker linkages between Environmental (E) indicators and CFP. In contrast, Governance (G) issues (i.e., issues related to board structure and board function) negatively influence CFP. In contrast, for medium-innovation companies (MICs), these relationships are absent and low-innovation companies (LICs) show negative relationships. Adopting reporting frameworks or guidelines affects CFP only in HIC. We introduce an original interpretative model, which identifies innovation (R&D) as the main driver in corporate sustainability, particularly in light of Social issues related to the production of a good or service. In terms of managerial implications, we identify three key factors for effectively embedding ESG in organizations' policies: investment in product innovation, compliance with environmental regulations, and corporate choices on brands and channels of external communication. © 2023 The Authors.

Despite a few research investigations, studies on ESG are still developing by using a broader range of new technologies to improve ESG transparency; overcoming shortcomings that have arisen have yet to be examined. Industry 5.0 (I5.0) provides an effective paradigm for comprehending the significance of technology in enhancing ESG disclosure and reporting. To handle the critical shift to wider sustainable development goals (SDGs) specifically, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) within the ESG monitoring system, this research digs into current ESG reporting concerns and obstacles. The study systematically reviews I5.0 and ESG reporting literature. The study also carries out an extensive content-centric assessment of relevant sources and information mappings to accomplish the research aims. The findings reveal that the fundamental characteristics of I5.0 are consistent with ESG, while I5.0 may accommodate ESG capabilities by improving ESG disclosure reliability, expanding from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing, broadening the range of reporting, lowering costs, and improving effectiveness. The findings suggest that ESG reporting must expand outside its company-centric emphasis, altering existing accounting methods to embrace ESG disclosure requirements more appropriately. ESG performance can be improved with clearer representation of environmental and social consequences, guiding both firms' and investors' decisions (double materiality concept) towards SDGs. New or missing (M) scores revealed by I5.0 technologies can assist both investors and company managers. © 2024 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, the diversity of ESG investing remains unattended amidst the growth in ESG literature, as the academic literature focuses dominantly on measuring performance. An understanding of a wide range of subjects entailing ESG is required before future research on ESG investing is performed. To overcome the challenge, this systematic literature review uses bibliometric mapping to reveal four significant research themes within the ESG investing literature: investor behavior and motivations for ESG investing; cost and risk mitigation in ESG investing; portfolio screening and ESG investing; and ESG performance. The review critically examines each theme and broadens the research agenda for future studies. In addition to the significant themes, this paper also discusses theoretical and recent research trends in the ESG investing literature. The review identifies clashes and crossovers between these themes to appropriately interpret one theme using another and emphasizes the heterogeneity in ESG investing. Lastly, discussion over concerns and criticisms of ESG investing highlights greenwashing as a major cause of concern for investors. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bibliometric; ESG investing; greenwashing; socially responsible; sustainable investment","","V.

It also looks at how specific firm attributes and board characteristics affect ESG reporting in three different industries. The analysis uses data for 8094 enterprises sampled from Asia and Europe between 2016 and 2021 that was gathered from secondary sources and taken from the Refinitiv Eikon database. According to the findings, proactive environmental investments, fines, and environmental expenses associated with ESG reporting are positively correlated. The findings also show that European businesses disclose environmental information at a higher degree than Asian businesses, which benefits their sustainability initiatives. Furthermore, sustainability indices have an adverse relationship with ESG reporting in Asia but a positive relationship with ESG reporting in Europe. Crucially, the findings show that various industries have varied relationships between sustainability reporting and environmental indicators. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers by highlighting the extent to which enterprises disclose their emissions, innovations, and resource use. Additionally, the study offers evidence on the role of corporate board members and how certain board characteristics as important mechanisms can improve the quality of ESG reporting making environmental disclosures useful and relevant. © 2024 The Authors.","Board Characteristics; Environmental Disclosure; Environmental Pillar; ESG Score; Firm Specifics; Sustainability Reporting","","","English","J.

There is a compelling business case for ESG acceptance and integration; however, it is challenging to integrate ESG because there is no decision support tool for integrating ESG into the natural resource exploiting industry. This study applies the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) multicriteria decision-making method (MCDM) to develop a hierarchical decision support framework for integrating ESG into the natural resource industry. Twenty-five experts selected from multiple stakeholder groups in the natural resource industry evaluated a total of 3 main criteria and 25 sub-criteria identified through literature reviews and company sustainability reports. The results showed that “E"" is the most important factor, followed by “S"" and “G.” The overall top five sub-criteria include, Governance structure (G2), Emission (E1), Health and Safety (S1), the composition of the highest governance body and its committee (G6), and Risk Governance (G3). The results imply that managers should seek to integrate ESG into the natural resource industry for sustainable supply chain management because it has a strong potential to improve the credibility of their sustainability performance reporting. Again, managers and practitioners in the natural resource exploiting industry should sustain their environmental efforts, especially regarding emissions but should also consider energy issues and spills to improve the overall sustainability performance of the industry. Policymakers can consider implementing reporting and disclosure requirements that mandate natural resource extraction companies to provide transparent and comprehensive information on their ESG performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; ESG; Natural resource extraction industry; Ordinal priority approach; Sustainability","Africa; Decision making; Decision support systems; Extraction; Health risks; Safety factor; Supply chain management; Africa; Decision supports; Environmental, social and governance; Natural resource extraction industry; Natural resource industries; Ordinal priority approach; Priority approach; Resource extraction; Support tool; Sustainability performance; conceptual framework; decision support system; multicriteria analysis; natural resource; performance assessment; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable development","C.

To test the hypotheses, we analyze firm-level data from 552 Taiwanese listed companies. The results suggest that ESG implementation mediates the relationship between a firm's ESG strategy and SDG impact. The governance structure plays a moderating role on the relationship between ESG implementation and SDG impact. Furthermore, the embeddedness of strategy shows a positive effect on SDG impact.

Findings showed the absence of social reporting and the disclosure of business governance, including sustainability strategy, and the poor reporting of the environmental and social pillars, except for product innovation, product quality, and responsible marketing themes. The capability of ESG disclosure to predict corporate profitability and access to credit is limited. Moreover, investments in product responsibility are negatively related to the cost of debt, while commitment toward the internal and external companies' community appears to predict their ability to access credit positively.

The methodology used followed the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, corroborated by a critical analysis. The results indicate that the integration of ESG criteria, observed from different perspectives, strengthens corporate sustainability performance. They also revealed narrowing gaps in the literature regarding methodological analysis. Most of the papers in the analyzed sample use company-level data and employ regression analysis in their analysis. The present study concludes that companies, regardless of nationality, follow the guidelines of ESG criteria integration and such procedure brings several benefits. It points to the lack of more confirmatory research approaches from a workers’ perspective, as the interest remains in the economic-environmental realm from the organizations’ point of view.

This paper aims to examine the relationship between the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars of a country’s development, green brand and digitalisation. To achieve the study’s goal, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied. The object of investigation was EU countries for 2016-2020. The findings allow us to conclude that a country's green brand is conducive to ESG performance by attracting green investment in renewable energies, social projects, and innovations. The results confirm that governments should prioritise sustainability initiatives, such as investing in renewable energy, adopting sustainable practices, and implementing environmental and social policies. Such efforts can enhance a country's green brand and lead to positive ESG outcomes, attracting more responsible businesses and investors. Moreover, digitalisation promoted governance by 0.142. The results showed that digitalisation could be a powerful tool for improving a country's green brand and ESG performance.

Item Response Theory (IRT) serves as a valuable approach for quantifying and exploring observable variables associated with these parameters. Therefore, this article aims to propose, apply, and validate an instrument utilizing IRT to measure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts on corporate sustainability performance, using the perspective of workers. Workers were chosen as key stakeholders for the present study, as they were pointed by previous research as central to corporate sustainability decisions. The present paper addresses a literature gap by introducing, implementing, and validating a research instrument, along with a comparative scale, to assess the effects of integrating ESG criteria on corporate sustainability performance. Workers of two major Brazilian electricity sector companies were respondents for this instrument. Multigroup IRT method was used to assess item discrimination and difficulty levels, and to construct a scale reflecting workers' perceptions of integrating ESG criteria. The questionnaire consisted of 15 items, demonstrating Content Validity Coefficients (CVC) above.97, confirming the instrument's content effectiveness. Cronbach's Alpha and McDonald's Omega were greater than.94 for both companies. Questionnaire items demonstrated satisfactory discrimination ability and varying difficulty levels, resulting in a five-level scale to gauge the impacts of ESG criteria. This research contributes through the introduction and validation of the research instrument, the latent trait assessment scale, and the evaluation of workers' perceptions regarding ESG criteria impacts on corporate sustainability performance. In conclusion, the proposed instrument showed robust psychometric properties, displaying favorable reliability and validity parameters. It effectively measures the impacts of ESG criteria, providing interpretable levels aligned with the unique characteristics of its constituent items. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anchoring method; environmental, social, and governance criteria; factor analysis; item response theory; multigroup analysis; workers' perception","Brazil; corporate social responsibility; factor analysis; perception; stakeholder; sustainability","A.D.S.

Here we estimate the relationship between company size and four environmental indicators to understand the environmental performance of nearly 6500 companies, building on the concept of allometric scaling and using Thomson Reuters EIKON data for the year 2018. We highlight that carbon dioxide emissions, energy use, water and waste production scale with the size according to a power law. This can be used as a benchmark to assess unambiguously a company’s environmental performance. We find that the adopted Environmental, Social & Governance rating is uncorrelated with the environmental performance. Our results suggest that a fair and effective environmental policy should consider the nature of the scaling relationship. Scaling laws suggest the existence of a nexus between an underlying network and corporate metabolism, whose understanding would help in discerning the determinants of environmental impacts. © 2024, The Author(s).","","carbon emission; energy use; environmental economics; environmental indicator; firm size; sustainability","F.

According to the socioemotional wealth theory, family firms place significant emphasis on sustainable development and long-term orientation, but this emphasis can be either internally or externally driven according to the type of involvement chosen by the owning family. Therefore, this study uses listed family firms to explore the relationship between different types of family involvement (i.e., family ownership and control, the influence of market competition, and the institutionalisation level of the environment in which a firm decides to pursue ESG criteria). We performed a multivariate regression analysis on a sample of 1,151 Chinese companies to test these relationships and found that both family ownership and control are positively related to ESG scores. Market competition negatively moderates the influence of both family ownership and control on the adoption of ESG criteria. Moreover, the influence of family control is negatively moderated by the institutional environment. Thus, types of family involvement seem to be relevant for the firm’s engagement with ESG criteria. © The Author(s) 2023.","ESG criteria; Family control; Family involvement; Family ownership; Socioemotional wealth theory","","M.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of US companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index between 2010 and 2019. The Thomson Reuters database was used to collect ESG disclosure scores and governance information. The authors applied multiple panel data regressions. Findings: The results showed that audit quality has a direct positive effect on ESG transparency. The findings also showed that the high exposure to public media by firms, the more they commit to high audit quality leading to disclose more transparent ESG information. Research limitations/implications: The results illustrated the significance of an external audit on an organization’s ESG report. Second, improving data quality has significant consequences not only for rating agencies but also for investors, businesses and researchers. These steps are required to increase the information content of ESG ratings. Originality/value: The findings demonstrated that third-party external verification improves the dependability of nonfinancial reporting, hence bridging the confidence gap between corporations and the market regarding sustainability reporting. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Audit quality; Disclosure; ESG transparency; Media coverage; S&P500 Stock index","","M.

This research paper explores the intricate interplay between AI-assisted BDA and strategic sustainable development (SSD) within the context of Industry 4.0, focusing on Italian manufacturing. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by the fusion of physical and digital worlds, has ushered in unprecedented advancements in technology and data analytics. AI-assisted BDA emerges as a powerful tool for harnessing vast datasets to drive innovation, efficiency, and sustainability strategies. It facilitates predictive maintenance, waste reduction, and optimal resource utilization. Furthermore, it aligns with circular economy principles by optimizing resource flows and promoting responsible sourcing. However, this digital transformation is not without challenges. Data privacy, security concerns, and the digital divide need addressing. Multidisciplinary approaches involving policymakers, academics, and industry leaders are essential to establish ethical norms and ensure inclusivity. The study’s theoretical implications call for a re-evaluation of the existing frameworks surrounding BDA’s role in sustainable development. It highlights the symbiotic relationship between digitization, BDA, and SSD, emphasizing the mediating role of environmental and social governance (ESG). This research underscores the transformative potential of AI-assisted BDA in Industry 4.0, bridging the gap between sustainability and innovation.

Our analysis covers 594 articles from 2007 to 2022, divided into two distinct periods. In the first period, the pillars are centered on contextualizing theories, the impact in terms of financial-related performance, and the ethical implications within the domain of corporate social responsibility. In the subsequent period, there is a notable progression towards reinforcing theoretical foundations. The pillars shift towards more practical implications, focusing on challenges associated with investing based on ESG criteria, guiding stakeholders in adapting to this paradigm, and addressing risks tied to its implementation. Financial performance, disclosure in reporting, and socially responsible investments remain crucial matters, and the analysis of the environmental issues outnumber social, and governance ones in both periods. We discuss the potential implications and further lines of research. © 2024 The Author(s).

Theoretically, a decline in the cost of capital is linked to a decrease in the firm risk. We measure CSR performance using the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) combined score from the Thomson Reuters EIKON database for non-financial enterprises between 2014 and 2019. A panel regression analysis has been run in order to test whether (1) the inclusion in the ESG combined ranking or (2) the level of the scores for ESG combines is linked to a decline in the cost of capital. Empirical evidence suggests that the level of the ESG combined score does not affect the firm's financial risk. Inclusion in the ESG combined index decreases the cost of equity and the average cost of capital instead. Firms that received an ESG combined score pay lower returns to investors. © 2023 The Authors.

As a result, researchers have paid notable attention to this subject. Though numerous studies have already explored various aspects of ESG in the context of emerging economies like Bangladesh, there is limited evidence on whether ESG practices promote customer brand perception (CBP). This study measures the impact of ESG on CBP deploying structural equation modeling in an emerging economy by analyzing the responses of 450 samples in accordance with the philosophies of triple bottom line theory and signaling theory. The results indicate that sustainability responsiveness, social and environmental disclosure practices, and CBP are positively impacted. Customers’ enhanced level of sustainability responsiveness strengthens the influence of governance disclosures in choosing a brand, while weakens the impact of environmental and social disclosures. However, the study concludes there is no significant effect of governance disclosures on CBP. The findings also reveal that social issues have the strongest impact on CBP among the ESG parameters. As sustainability concerns increase, customers either demand more sustainability performance from brands or their impression of the brands declines correspondingly. The study outlines a customer’s viewpoint on the requirements of ESG and sustainability concerns, which will contribute organizations to adopt appropriate ESG strategies and address sustainability challenges to win over customers and strengthen their brand image.

However, research that looks at factors that influence carbon emissions is scarce. We address this gap by empirically examining the impact of internal and external initiatives on firms' carbon footprints, as captured by their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Using secondary data collected from CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), we carry out an inductive analysis to understand the role of some of the more commonly adopted practices for carbon footprint reduction by non-financial companies in the Global 500 list, which represents the largest companies by market capitalization. Specifically, we investigate factors contributing to internal and external decarbonization efforts in a company's supply chain, and how they affect emissions and financial performance outcomes. Consistent with past sustainability research, we include financial and environmental motives as key considerations for assessing the usefulness of carbon reduction practices. However, we find limited support for the factors that we hypothesized to influence carbon footprint reduction and economic benefits, and most firms pursuing carbon reduction initiatives were yet to see the effectiveness of the initiatives. All internal initiatives, except the disclosure scores, were positively associated with Scope 1 emissions. The influence of supplier engagement on Scope 3 emissions was significant, but non-significant on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. As such, rigorous and comprehensive reporting about sources and the management of emissions do not necessarily translate into lower emissions by external supply chain partners. Finally, reduction of emissions per se did not lead to superior financial performance. Theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Inductive analysis; Scope 1; Scope 2 and scope 3 emissions; Secondary data","Emission control; Finance; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Carbon Disclosure Project; Carbon footprint reductions; Financial companies; Financial performance; Managerial implications; Market capitalization; Reduction of emissions; Supply chain partners; Carbon footprint","S.K.

ESG assessment is one of the important institutions of the green financial system, which plays a significant part in boosting corporate green development. We use the number of green patent applications and green patent citations to measure corporate green innovation and analyze the micro-green effects of the ESG score system using the panel fixed effects models, which means that we explore the impact of the ESG scores on corporate green innovation performance, the specific mechanism of this effect, and the asymmetry of this impact under different moderation effects by using Chinese listed A-shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010–2019 as our research sample. We find that ESG positively affects corporate green innovation; the higher the ESG evaluation, the more it improves firms’ green innovation performance. The promotion effect is reflected quantitatively and qualitatively and remains valid after several robustness tests. In addition, the contribution of ESG to corporate green innovation is achieved through two main paths improving corporate investment efficiency and government-enterprise relations. Corporate black attributes inhibit the contribution of ESG to green innovation, while green attributes strengthen the contribution of ESG to green innovation performance. Our study demonstrates the importance of corporate participation in environmental, social, and governance practices for corporate green innovation, which is beneficial for achieving win-win environmental, social, and economic results. Furthermore, our research completes the research on the effects of corporate green performance and green finance. It can provide empirical references for promoting corporate green development and improving the ESG evaluation system. © 2023 Zhang, Chen.

However, sustainable management of TSW is challenging as it contains hazardous chemicals. Implementing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices can support managing TSW towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is not easy to implement ESG practices for TSW management since numerous challenges exist in the system. To assist TSW management through ESG implementation, it is imperative to investigate the interactions among challenges and mitigation strategies. However, the existing decision-making models cannot deal with the uncertainty and vagueness on a border scale during interaction evaluation and alternatives ranking. Additionally, there is a shortage of scientific works on ESG practices in emerging economies. Therefore, this study, for the first time, offers an integrated novel Dombi t-norm and Dombi t-conorm grounded interval valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) Delphi, an extended IVFFSs-weighted influence non-liner Gause system (WINGS), and novel IVFFSs-TODIM approach which is utterly lacking in the present literature. Also, the study offers a strategic roadmap to understand the interlinkage of findings with SDGs. The results of the IVFFSs-WINGS analysis confirmed that the “Lack of solid waste management policy” is the most critical challenge for ESG implementation. Further, IVFFSs-TODIM analysis confirmed that the “Policy development for TSW management complying with ESG and SDGs” is the top ESG challenges mitigation strategy for TSW management. The study's findings will provide guidance for government agencies, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders of the emerging economies tannery industry for successful implementation of ESG practices, thus helping to achieve SDGs. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ESG strategies; IVFFS-Delphi; IVFFS-TODIM; IVFFS-WINGS; Solid waste management; Sustainable development goals","developing world; hazardous waste; mitigation; policy development; pollution policy; solid waste; stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal; waste management","J.

Amidst intensifying market competition, crafting a sustainable supply chain for overseas expansion has become an indispensable core element for driving corporate internationalization. This study focuses on the sustainability generation mechanism of the overseas supply chain of Chinese pre-cooked meal A-share listed companies, employing the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method. Herein, an in-depth analysis of 388 data points from 17 listed companies has been conducted. The study systematically reveals the key factors affecting the sustainability of overseas supply chains and identifies three critical sustainability generation paths: the technology-driven and norm compliance model (path 1), the market sensitivity and product innovation model (path 2), and the robust operation and risk control model (path 3). The present study not only introduces a novel perspective on the application of a TOE framework within the realms of sustainable supply chain management and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria but also offers clear directions for companies to enhance sustainability in their overseas expansion process. This includes strengthening technological research and development, compliance construction, market adaptability, product diversity, infrastructure construction, and risk management.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are therefore gaining increasing importance, in line with the growing demand for corporate sustainability. ESG ratings foster the comparison of companies with respect to their sustainable practices. This study aims to investigate how ESG ratings impact financial performance in the European food industry. Ordinary least squares regression is applied to analyze the relation between ESG ratings and financial performance over a 4-year period from 2017 to 2020. The profitability measures Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are employed as financial performance measures, while ESG ratings are obtained from the database CSRHub. Results show that higher ESG ratings are associated with better financial performance. Although the effect is modest in the present study, the findings support previous results that ESG ratings are positively related to financial performance. Nonetheless, they also highlight that ESG ratings strongly converge to the mean, which depicts the need to reassess whether ESG ratings are able to measure actual ESG behavior. © 2022 The Authors.

However, prior studies have not extensively investigated this issue. Hence, this study, based on stakeholder theory, seeks to examine the effect of ESG on CB toward brands under the moderating effect of DT. To this end, data was collected from 306 students from Yemeni universities via an online questionnaire and analyzed using PLS-SEM via SmartPLS software. The results showed a direct relationship between ESG and CB. Specifically, the environmental dimension had the strongest effect on CB, followed by the social dimension and governance dimension. The results also found that DT moderates the relationship between the environmental dimension of ESG and CB, in contrast, the effect of DT on the relationship of the social dimension of ESG or the governance dimension of ESG on CB is not significant. © 2024 The Author(s).

Whether state-owned equity participation in private enterprises can facilitate the development of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in private enterprises is a question that needs urgent examination. This study aims to investigate the impact of state-owned equity participation on the ESG performance of private enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: Using Chinese listed companies as the research sample, this study uses econometric methods such as multiple regression to analyze the relationship between state-owned equity and the ESG performance of private enterprises. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms and influencing factors of this relationship. Findings: There is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between state-owned equity and the ESG performance of private enterprises. Mechanism analysis reveals that resource effects and governance effects play a mediating role in this nonlinear relationship. Furthermore, the authors find that environmental regulation and managers' attention to the environment positively moderate the relationship between state-owned equity participation and ESG performance. Practical implications: A reasonable equity structure is crucial for enhancing corporate ESG performance. Moderate state-owned equity participation helps to leverage resource integration and governance advantages, which will assist private enterprises in maximizing ESG performance and achieving sustainable development. Social implications: In advancing the process of mixed-ownership reform, the government should maintain an appropriate proportion of state-owned equity to avoid excessive intervention in enterprise decision-making. At the same time, it should ensure that enterprises can genuinely undertake their social and environmental responsibilities while pursuing economic benefits. This is of great significance for promoting sustainable economic and social development. Originality/value: This study integrates state-owned equity, ESG and nonlinear relationships into a single research framework. It explores the internal mechanisms and influencing factors of their relationship, overcoming the limitations of previous studies and provides a new perspective for understanding the impact of state-owned equity on corporate ESG performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ESG; Governance effect; Inverted U-shaped relationship; Resource effect; State-owned equity","","P.

Stakeholders, namely, investors, are relying on firms' environmental, social, and governance disclosures (ESGD) to evaluate their ESG performance and strategize their investment decision-making. Since firms have substantial discretionary power in deciding the quantity and quality of ESGD, understanding the drivers and motivations of ESGD is paramount. This study examines the literature on the determinants of ESGD, and 36 articles published in a period spanning from 2006 to 2022 were analyzed and synthesized via a systematic literature review approach. Ninety-one researchers from 30 countries contributed to these studies. Of these studies, 28% perform cross-country investigations. This study found that although there is no single underpinning theory for ESGD, ESGD determinant studies are well supported by multiple theoretical frameworks, such as stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, and institutional theory. This study reveals many factors that have an impact on ESGD, such as natural disasters, political and legal systems, ownership structure, board characteristics, and the CEO's characteristics. This study contributed to the burgeon of literature on ESG by offering valuable insights into the antecedents to ESG performance and facilitating future enhancements of a better ESGD framework.

Then along comes more demands to deliver successful environmental, social, and governance (ESG) outcomes. Understanding public perceptions of ESG is paramount to gaining public support, advancing ESG actions, and creating a sustainable ESG policy system. This study aims to explore the general public's perceptions of ESG. The setting is China, where ESG is in its infancy and ESG policies are incomplete. Given the richness of social media data, a social media analytics (SMA) framework is applied to obtain public perceptions from Sina Weibo, the largest Chinese social media platform. The SMA framework integrates descriptive analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis to investigate the characteristics of users concerned about ESG, discover latent ESG-based topics from posts and examine corresponding attention, as well as identify public sentiment orientation and opinions on ESG from their comments. The results indicate that there are regional and industry-specific disparities in ESG-conscious users. The latent topics often discussed in posts include ESG investment, ESG disclosure, ESG rating, and ESG notion and practice. It is observed that the increasing number of Weibo posts has not received the corresponding growing attention. The comments containing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments account for 66.03%, 17.37%, and 16.60%, respectively. The negative sentiments might result from the greenwashing effect, inadequate knowledge of ESG, inconsistency among ESG ratings, and lack of transparency in rating methods. The findings can aid policymakers and corporations in proactively comprehending public needs and providing guidance for effective ESG communication on social media and policy improvement. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","ESG; Public perceptions; Sentiment analysis; Social media analytics; Topic modeling","Social networking (online); Environmental challenges; Environmental, social, and governance; Negative sentiments; Public perception; Public support; Sentiment analysis; Social challenges; Social media analytics; Social media datum; Topic Modeling; Sentiment analysis","W.-Z.

Employing ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares methods, the empirical results reveal a negative correlation between underinvestment and ESG ratings, particularly in the environmental and social dimensions. Further analysis shows that the effects vary among state-owned enterprises (SOE) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOE), as well as companies facing different financing constraints. Notably, SOE and entities with significant financing limitations experience a more pronounced decline in ESG evaluations due to underinvestment tendencies. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for ESG-related policy and strategic adjustments, enhancing our understanding of the consequences of underinvestment on ESG metrics.

In order to more systematically elucidate the evolutionary trend, status quo, hotspots and overall structure of research in the field of ESG, we searched based on the Web of Science core ensemble database, and comprehensively utilized bibliometrics and content analysis to analyze and mine the data of research on the theme of ESG from 1991 to 2023. The results of the study show that: (1) ESG research is gradually attracting attention from all countries, with a steady growth in results, rich and diversified research, and the main research power is concentrated in mainstream developed countries. (2) The proportion of funded research in the field of ESG is large, and countries are deepening their research on ESG one after another. There are great research prospects and opportunities in this field in the future. (3) The level of ESG research has gradually deepened from theoretical research to multidisciplinary cross-application research. The issues of ""responsible investment"", “corporate social responsibility” and “sustainable development” are the main themes of ESG research. Meanwhile, “ESG investment” and “ESG disclosure” are cutting-edge trends in ESG research. (4) Future ESG research may focus more on social latitude (S) versus governance latitude (G). This study facilitates the investigation of key contributors in the environmental, social and governance fields at micro, meso and macro levels, and provides insights into the structure and direction of knowledge in the ESG field for future research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometrics; Content analysis; Cutting-edge trends; Data mining; Environmental; Social and governance (ESG)","Cutting tools; Environmental protection; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics analysis; Content analysis; Cutting edges; Cutting-edge trend; Environmental; Environmental issues; Evolutionary trend; Social and governance (environmental, social and governance); Systematic literature review; Data mining","S.

However, little attention has been paid to the nexus of ESG and CFP. This paper attempts firstly to investigate the bidirectional causality of ESG and CFP, followed by the micro-foundations, and finally, the moderating effect of intrinsic factors. A GMM-PVAR method was used to examine the research hypotheses, which can effectively deal with endogenous problems that have been ignored by traditional literature. The findings of this research demonstrate that CFP promoted ESG growth, but ESG did not boost CFP. This asymmetric causality was because CFP had a supportive effect on the environment and society pillars, while the social pillar cannot promote CFP, and the environment pillar negatively affects CFP. The relationship between ESG and CFP was moderated by total quality management, environmental sensitivity, and the pay gap. Furtherly, a panel threshold model was constructed to access the threshold effects of ESG on CFP, showing an inverted U-shape. Based on these findings, the theoretical implications, managerial prescriptions, and limitations are also discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bidirectional relationship; Corporate financial performance; Environmental, social, and corporate governance; GMM-PVAR; Granger causality; Threshold effects","Asian People; East Asian People; Humans; Prescriptions; environmental economics; environmental quality; financial system; governance approach; Granger causality test; threshold; Asian; East Asian; human; prescription","J.

Path planning technology is one of the key technologies to achieve intelligent mobile robots. In order to improve the pickup efficiency and to reduce the resource waste and carbon emissions in logistics, we investigate the robot path optimization problem. Under the guidance of the sustainable development theory, we aim to achieve the goal of environmental social governance by shortening and smoothing robot paths. To improve the robot’s ability to avoid dynamic obstacles and to quickly solve shorter and smoother robot paths, we propose a fusion algorithm based on the improved genetic algorithm and the dynamic window approach. By doing so, we can improve the efficiency of warehouse operations and reduce logistics costs, whilst also contributing to the realization of a green supply chain.

This study draws on signaling theory, stakeholder theory, and opportunism theory, and uses panel data from Chinese A-share listed firms from 2009 to 2022. It identifies a U-shaped relationship between ESG performance and stock price crash risk, indicating that the increase in ESG performance decreases stock price crash risk, but after reaching a threshold value, it increases the risk. Green innovation moderates this U-shaped relationship, reinforcing its effects. Meanwhile, earnings management plays a mediating role in this U-shaped relationship. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that the U-shaped relationship is significant in polluting industries, firms without the duality of chairperson and CEO, firms with high analyst coverage, and those under high market competition. The moderating effect of green innovation is particularly significant in firms with poor external legal environments and firms with positive management tone.

In Thailand, agriculture is integral to both the economy and society, employing approximately 25 million people. However, agricultural workers often earn lower average incomes compared to those in other sectors (Digital Economy Promotion Agency [DEPA], 2020).

This study aims to explore the application of ESG within Thailand’s rice production supply chain, evaluate its impact on sector competitiveness, and identify best practices for integration. Utilizing qualitative methods, including content analysis and interviews with 30 participants, the findings reveal that ESG adoption presents substantial opportunities for improving sustainability and competitiveness. By fostering environmental stewardship, promoting social welfare, and strengthening governance, ESG can help farmers and businesses tackle challenges such as resource inefficiency and market volatility. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of public-private partnerships and supportive policies in establishing a sustainable, ESG-driven rice production system, which could serve as a model for other developing nations aspiring to implement sustainable agricultural practices. © 2025 The Authors.","Environmental and Social Governance; ESG; Innovative Practices; Rice Industry; Sustainable Development","","","English","Corp.

In addition, the authors study whether differences in the levels of national commitment to gender-equality policies affect the effectiveness of gender-diverse boards and management in curbing ESG misconduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the role of women directors and women executives in ESG misconduct using a European sample of analysis of 2,994 firm-year observations from 2015 to 2020. Findings: The authors find that gender diversity effectively prevents ESG misconduct only in countries with strong national policies supporting gender equality. Specifically, women directors and executives significantly reduce ESG misconduct in these countries, demonstrating the complementary role of gender diversity and national equality policies. In addition, female chief executive officers are more likely to curb negative ESG practices in firms operating within gender-equal corporate environments, noting that female chief executive officers are not effective in reducing irresponsible ESG behavior when they are not supported by a critical mass of women directors or executives. Practical implications: This paper finds novel evidence that the influence of female representation on ESG misconduct is not linear but conditional on the level of female proportion; women in the minority (usually under 3) can scarcely influence group decisions because their specific female attributes are only evident when the visibility and legitimacy of the female group are high enough. Firms led by female chief executive officers seem to reduce ESG misconduct, especially when their chief suites are above a critical threshold. But queen bee female chief executive officers are not effective in reducing adverse ESG activity if their boards and TMTs are not gender diverse; the joint effect of women in different hierarchical positions contributes to decreasing ESG failures. Social implications: These findings are useful for policymakers because they show that although there is growing social concern about business gender equality and increasing regulatory efforts through soft/hard gender quotas, stakeholders will not completely benefit from firm gender diversity without national support for gender equality. Originality/value: This study contributes to the sustainable development literature by examining the direct effects of gender diversity at multiple levels of a firm’s hierarchy (chief suite, board, TMTs), as well as addressing the gap between firm gender diversity and national gender equality policies as mechanisms to reduce ESG misconduct. It also explores the queen bee phenomenon, noting that female leaders in non-diverse organizations often adapt their leadership style to align with masculine corporate cultures. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical mass; ESG; Female directors; Female executives; Gender equality policies; Misconduct","","J.

By employing digital tools, firms can improve their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, increase transparency, and maintain stakeholders' accountability. This increasing significance has elevated the value of examining the impact of digitalisation on firm-level ESG performance and disclosures. This study explores this relationship by synthesising 199 relevant research records published during 2019–2024, obtained from Web of Science and Scopus, using a bibliometric and systematic literature review approach. Our descriptive analysis reveals exponential growth in publications on this relationship during the study period, focusing predominantly on quantitative research leveraging secondary data. Regression analysis emerged as the most popular analytical technique, followed by structural equation modelling. The theoretical foundations of this research are based on the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities view. The Co-occurrence analysis identifies China, Italy, and England as the leading contributors, with research hot spots centring around concepts such as ‘Industry 4.0’, ‘sustainability performance’, ‘sustainable development’, and ‘sustainability reporting’. Co-citation analysis highlights the leading journals, authors, and documents, emphasising the scholarly foundations of this field. Further, thematic analysis uncovers the benefits of digitalisation across four dominant dimensions: sustainability performance, supply chain sustainability, sustainability assessment, and sustainability accounting and reporting. Finally, we discuss critical knowledge gaps and propose future research questions to advance understanding of this emerging field. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace; digital transformation; ESG disclosure; ESG performance; knowledge domain visualisation","","I.

Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrated strategic framework for the implementation of effective green growth strategies for Morocco's sustainable development. Thirty-two indicators were identified and categorized into five groups: environmental, social, governance, financial variability, and technological innovation. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to assess and rank the main indicators and their subindicators. Furthermore, within the study, we developed nine green growth strategic solutions for sustainable development. The fuzzy VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) approach was employed to evaluate and rank the proposed strategic solutions. The FAHP results revealed that environmental, governance, and technological innovation factors are the most pivotal among the five primary categories. Among the subfactors, transparency and disclosure received the top ranking, followed by social community engagement and market volatility. FVIKOR indicated that the most effective strategies for promoting green growth in Morocco include improving transparency and disclosure methods, issuing green bonds, and increasing shareholder engagement. This research provides essential insights for developing effective strategies to foster green growth in Morocco, thereby aiding Morocco's progress in sustainable performance. It also offers practical guidance for policymakers by identifying priority areas improving transparency, expanding green finance, and enhancing stakeholder engagement to accelerate Morocco's green growth and sustainable development efforts. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","environmental sustainability; green growth; integrated framework; Morocco; strategic decision-making; sustainable development","","M.

The extraction industries are poised to play a pivotal role in providing key environmental information to downstream organizations. However, these industries face unique environmental challenges, making it difficult to identify what is significant to disclose. This article explores significant environmental impacts within the quarrying sector, from a lifecycle perspective. Quarries, where mechanical extraction and processing for rock products (including aggregates and ornamental stone) occur, are integral for infrastructure projects worldwide. To identify significant environmental aspects that should be considered in comprehensive environmental assessment for quarry stakeholders, a systematic literature review is conducted with in-depth content analysis. This reveals potential significant environmental impacts, trends, and crucial knowledge gaps. Nine relevant environmental aspects are found across six lifecycle stages for quarries. Notably, differences in environmental concepts are observed. To help overcome some conceptual barriers and improve understanding at a holistic level, environmental aspects are mapped to endpoint impacts where notable damages can occur. The findings suggest more harmonization of significance assessment for environmental impacts is needed to facilitate cross-disciplinary discourse. Waste management and transport emerge as key areas that demand increased attention. Additionally, future research efforts should focus on exploring ways to reduce environmental impact in quarries. © 2024 The Authors","Decision-making; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management system; Extraction; Life cycle assessment; Mine; Quarry","Decision making; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; Life cycle; Quarries; Waste management; Decisions makings; Down-stream; Environmental aspects; Environmental challenges; Environmental information; Infrastructure project; Life cycle assessment; Mechanical extraction; Mechanical processing; Ornamental stone; Extraction","C.

This study aims to explore the role of AI adoption in firm environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. By analyzing 23,094 firm-year observations of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2009 to 2021, the primary findings reveal that AI significantly improves firm ESG performance. This highlights the importance of technological advancements in driving environmental efficiency and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, the impact is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, compared to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and in central SOEs than local SOEs. Additionally, the mechanism analysis indicates that AI helps firms alleviate financing constraints, enhance internal control, and improve overall firm performance, leading to enhanced ESG performance over time. Moreover, the impact is more pronounced in regions with high fintech activity, strict environmental regulations, and high bank concentration. These findings highlight the substantial role of China's government in advancing the digital economy and broader ESG initiatives.

Many articles and exposés have led consumers to be more conscious of purchasing products from companies who source materials in a socially responsible and ethical manner. As a result, business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumers (B2C) companies are under increased pressure to source raw materials in a transparent and ethical way. Because of the associated costs, companies then look to benefit from increased brand equity by promoting to consumers how ethical their products are. The purpose of this study is to look at the case of the food industry to analyze sustainability messaging on Twitter in both B2B and B2C companies to determine which of the dimensions of sustainability (people, profit, planet) are being emphasized. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, two published dictionaries were combined to capture the three dimensions of “sustainability,” and these scales were then used to analyze Twitter posts. This study created a unique software package to classify, mine, collect and analyze Twitter data. This study used these tools to analyze 246,386 Twitter posts within a sample of 39 leading B2C and B2B food companies over a 10-year period (2012–2021) to explore brand messaging and engagement rate. Findings: This research revealed several interesting results. These include how B2B companies have emphasized the employee (people) dimensions of sustainability, while B2C companies have had a more balanced approach that overall has prioritized the economic dimension (profit) of sustainability. The data on audience engagement revealed a mismatch between the types of sustainability messaging B2B companies and B2C companies in the food industry are posting and what engages audiences. Originality/value: This study fills several gaps, including analyzing how B2B and B2C companies use sustainability language in their social media brand management, as well as looking at which dimensions of sustainability they emphasize and which ones engage audiences the most.

Existing studies have focused on the driving role of formal institutions on corporate ESG performance while ignoring the motivational role of informal institutions such as culture. Based on the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021, this study adopts textual analysis to quantify corporate culture and discusses the impact of corporate culture on ESG performance and its internal mechanism. We find that corporate culture significantly enhances ESG performance. Mechanism test indicates that corporate culture can promote green innovation and improve information transparency through resource and information effect, enhancing ESG performance. We further demonstrate differences in the impact of corporate culture dimensions on ESG performance, with innovation culture and quality culture being the most prominent. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the impact of corporate culture on ESG performance. In the context of non-state-owned property rights, low market attention, and high economic policy uncertainty, the impact of corporate culture on ESG performance is more significant. This paper enriches the related research on ESG performance drivers from the informal system perspective and provides decision-making references for enterprises to promote ESG practices and achieve sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate culture; ESG performance; Green innovation; Information transparency","Decision making; Economics; Transparency; Corporate culture; Corporates; Environmental, social, and governance performance; Green innovations; Information effects; Information transparency; Innovation Culture; Performance; Quality culture; Textual-analysis; Sustainable development","Y.

Methodology: The study employed a panel regression approach to assess the impact of a firm’s ESG score on its performance (accounting and market) and risk. The data encompassed 1,973 firms across 17 developed and 14 emerging countries, ranging over 5 regions and 11 industries. Findings: The results revealed a non-linear relationship between ESG scores and business performance, suggesting that ESG activities initially had a negative impact and eventually had positive long-term benefits. Furthermore, the strength of this relationship differed between developed and emerging economies. It indicated regional variances in ESG performance, with Europe and the Middle Eastern countries leading the way. Practical Implications: The study emphasized the importance of considering country, industry, and regional factors while evaluating the impact of the ESG score. Expenditures on ESG activities could have a complex and dynamic influence on company performance, with differences observed across different contexts. Stakeholders need this information to understand how the ESG practices of organizations change over time and how they may affect their financial performance and risk. This may also have financial repercussions for creditors, regulatory bodies, and investors. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of ESG on firm performance and risk at various levels, including country, industry, and region, in both developed and emerging economies. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Therefore, on the basis of a systematic literature review of 80 studies, we examine, in detail, the subject areas and emphasize the main points in the existing literature. The findings reveal that there are four main thematic areas attracting research interest, as follows: (1) A shift in value creation; (2) green bonds; (3) ESG ratings and performance; and (4) sustainable finance, banking, and financial risks.

Motivation: Although anecdotal evidence indicates a rising investment in blockchain technology, there is currently a lack of systematic literature reviews assessing its implications in accounting issues. While blockchain holds significant potential, the challenges and opportunities associated with its integration into financial reporting warrant further investigation. Design/Methodology/Approach: From 2017 to 2023, a systematic literature review in the accounting, business, and management journals from the Scopus Database identified 77 articles on blockchain and accounting. Main findings: Increasing the quality of information using blockchain positively impacts governance, accountability, supply chain, innovation, shareholder value, and sustainability reporting. However, stakeholders' high expectations of these benefits, coupled with a minimal understanding of blockchain and the need for accounting regulations or standards governing blockchain adoption, may reduce the reliability and relevance of information derived from blockchain adoption, potentially leading to opportunistic behaviour. Practical implications: Organizations must manage risks amidst high expectations(hype) surrounding the adoption of this technology. Further research into earnings management–whether opportunistic or beneficial–and its impact on non-profits and SMEs could yield valuable insights.

However, few studies have investigated the governance composition and characteristics of MIs involving the UPF industry, nor considered the implications for organizing global responses to UPFs and other major food systems challenges. We address this gap by conducting a network analysis to map global MIs involving the UPF industry, drawing data from web sources, company reports, business and market research databases, and academic and grey literature. We identified 45 such global food system MIs. Of these, executives from the UPF industry or affiliated interest groups held almost half (n = 263, or 43.8%) of the total 601 board seat positions. Executives from a small number of corporations, especially Unilever (n = 20), Nestlé (n = 17), PepsiCo Inc (n = 14), and The Coca-Cola Company (n = 13) held the most board seat positions, indicating centrality to the network. Board seats of these MIs are dominated by executives from transnational corporations (n = 431, or 71.7%), high-income countries (n = 495, or 82.4%), and four countries (United States, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) (n = 350, or 58.2%) in particular. This study shows that MIs involving the UPF industry privilege the interests of corporations located near exclusively in the Global North, draw legitimacy through affiliations with multi-lateral agencies, civil society groups and research institutions, and represent diverse corporate interests involved in UPF supply chains. Corporate-anchored multi-stakeholderism, as a form of GFG governance, raises challenges for achieving food systems transformation, including the control and reduction of UPFs in human diets. © The Author(s) 2024.","Corporate power; Food policy; Food systems; Global food governance; Multi-stakeholder; Ultra-processed foods","","S.

The ripple effects of industrial chain ESG are more pronounced when the focal firm demonstrates financial stability, maintains geographic proximity to the upstream and downstream chains, possesses a larger firm size, or operates under private ownership. Further, the paper finds that corporate ESG initiatives exert industrial chain ripple effects through two channels: optimizing the matching of supply and demand between upstream and downstream companies and focal firms; and stabilizing the supply-demand relationship through interactions between focal firms and upstream and downstream entities. This study aims to elucidate the phenomenon of focal firms adopting ESG practices, and how it is affected by upstream and downstream entities within the industrial chain.

While vital to an economy's success, banking is not immune to societal, environmental and economic consequences of business practices. The study has examined the sustainable performance of banking institutions on the suggested multidimensional framework comprising economic, environmental, social, governance and financial dimensions and 52 sustainability indicators. The study benchmarks the significant performance indicators of leading banks indispensable to sustainable banking performance. The findings attempt to address research questions concerning the extent of sustainable banking performance, ranking the sustainability dimensions and indicators and standardizing sustainability adoption metrics. Design/methodology/approach: To determine the responsiveness of the banking industry to sustainability dimensions, content analysis was conducted using NVivo software for the year 2021–2022. Furthermore, a hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is used by integrating entropy, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) to provide relative weights to performance indicators and prioritize banks based on their sustainable performance. Sensitivity analysis is used to ensure the robustness of results. Findings: In the context of the Indian banking industry, the pattern of sustainability reporting is inconsistent and concentrated on addressing environmental and social concerns. The results of the entropy methodology prioritized “Environmental” sustainability over other selected dimensions while “Financial” dimension has been assigned the least priority in the ranking order. The significant sustainable performance indicators delineated in this study should be used as standards to ensure the accountability and credibility of the sustainable banking industry. Additionally, the research findings will provide valuable inputs to policymakers and regulators to assure better contribution of the banking sector in meeting sustainability goals. Originality/value: Considering the paucity of studies on sustainable banking performance, this study makes two significant contributions to the literature. First, the suggested multidimensional disclosure model integrating financial and nonfinancial indicators would facilitate banking institutions in addressing the five aspects of sustainability. As one of the first studies in the context of the Indian banking industry, the findings would pave the way for better diffusion of sustainability practices. Second, the inclusion of MCDM techniques prioritizes the significance of sustainability indicators and benchmarks the performance of leading banks to achieve better profits and more substantial growth. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Entropy; MCDM; Sustainable banking; TOPSIS; VIKOR","","D.

However, for developing economies like Ghana, studies on stakeholders’ pressure and sustainable development has not received much attention. Hence, this study examines the influence of stakeholders’ pressure on sustainability disclosure and employed green technological innovation (GTI) as a mediating factor. The study focused on mining and manufacturing firms because their processes are known to release carbon dioxide, create waste. The data utilize in this study was collected from 383 respondents in Ghana via online questionnaires. PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data and tested the hypothesis for the study using SMART-PLS 4. The results demonstrated that stakeholder pressure substantially improves sustainability disclosure performance. Also, the results revealed that a firm’s GTI mediates the connection between stakeholder pressure in terms of shareholder and consumer pressures. However, government pressure and sustainability disclosure were found to be insignificant. The study recommends that managers should incorporate GTI into the product design and manufacturing process since it enables firms not only fulfill their client’s needs but also reduce their environmental impacts, like the production of carbon dioxide and solid debris. © 2024 The Author(s).

Using this method, based on a fuzzy expert system (FES), it is possible to generate a comprehensive rating for the assessment of the sustainability of a firm. Up to now, measurement has been hampered by a lack of clarity in theoretical frameworks and empirical methods for the Corporate Social Responsibility construct. The algorithm of the Fuzzy Expert System aggregates multicriteria evaluations of a problem. The assessments of behavior and the resulting decisions are represented in blocks of rules, drawn up by an inference engine in fuzzy logic. The Fuzzy Expert System unites the ability of an expert system to simulate the decision-making process with the uncertainty typical of human reasoning, present in fuzzy logic. Despite the spread of Corporate Social Responsibility practices among firms, there is not a commonly accepted method of measuring sustainability. Moreover, although Environmental social governance (ESG) rating agencies provide Corporate Social Responsibility ratings, their methods have certain weaknesses. Considering the growing importance of socially responsible financial markets, this topic could be of vital importance for decision-makers in the management of their investments, by remedying deficiencies in methods used by sustainability rating organizations. The outcome of the application is a system designed to measure the CSR identity of a firm. On the management side, the possibility to identify the determinants of the different Corporate Social Responsibility intermediate indicators making up the final Corporate Social Responsibility index would allow CSR-compliant managers to use this information for decision-making purposes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CSR assessment; CSR identity; CSR score; Fuzzy Expert System; Performance measurement","Computer circuits; Electronic trading; Expert systems; Fuzzy logic; Rating; Reconfigurable hardware; Sustainable development; CSR assessment; CSR identity; CSR score; Fuzzy expert systems; Performance measurements; Decision making","A.

However, the current echelon utilization system for retired batteries remains immature, exposing numerous issues in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. This paper seeks to enhance and regulate ESG issues throughout the lifecycle of EV batteries and explore the balanced decisions of battery manufacturers (BMs) and electric vehicle manufacturers (EVMs) in a supply chain. Using the Stackelberg game model, we explore ESG-related cost-sharing contracts across three distinct supply chain models, influenced by BM's ESG improvements and EVM's due diligence efforts. Our analysis reveals that prioritizing ESG considerations enhances mutual benefits, with centralized systems consistently outperforming decentralized ones. Notably, as consumer sensitivity to recycling prices increases, BMs tend to lower their recycling prices, which can reduce battery recycling rates and hinder the sustainable development of the closed-loop battery supply chain. To better align the interests of supply chain members, we propose a two-way cost-sharing contract, with EVMs favoring moderate arrangements to avoid profit loss for both parties.

The objectives are to identify: (1) the latest research, development, and innovation activities; (2) issues and key barriers related to the technology readiness to bring biogas/biomethane to market; and (3) commercialisation issues, including cost parity with natural gas (the main competitor). A survey of the literature was carried out based on research articles and grey literature. The PESTEL and SWOT analyses identified opportunities for these fuels due to the relevant regulations (e.g., Fit for 55; the recent inclusion of the Mediterranean Sea as a SECA and PM control area; MPEC 79), market-based measures, and environmental, social, and governance strategies. The potential of biomass feedstock is estimated to have a substantial value that can satisfy the energy needs of the maritime industry. However, production costs of biomethane are high; estimated to be 2–4 times higher compared to natural gas. The market is moving in the direction of alternative drop-in fuels, including liquefied and compressed biomethane (LBM and CBM) and biogas. In terms of potential market penetration, LBM can be used as a marine drop-in fuel for the existing fleet that already combust LNG and LPG due to similar handling. Currently, these vessels are LNG and LPG tankers. However, in newly built vessels, LBM can be also supplied to container ships, vehicle carriers, and bulk carriers (about 20% of newly built vessels).

Data from 2018 to 2022 is sourced from the Bloomberg database, focusing on ESGD scores as indicators of companies’ ESG commitments. The study utilizes a structural equation model to examine the relationships between independent variables; ESGD, Earnings Per Share (EPS), Debt to Assets ratio (DA), Return on Investment Capital (ROIC), Total Assets (TA), and dependent variables Tobin’s Q (TBQ) and Return on Assets (ROA). The analysis reveals a positive relationship between ESGD and TBQ, but not with ROA. Further exploration is conducted to determine if different ESGD levels (high, medium, low) yield consistent effects on TBQ. The findings indicate discrepancies: high and medium ESGD levels are associated with a negative impact on TBQ when EPS increased, whereas low ESGD levels correlate with an increase in TBQ with rising EPS. This nuanced approach challenges the conventional uniform treatment of ESGD in previous research and provides a deeper understanding of how varying commitments to ESG practices affect a firm’s market valuation and profitability. These insights are crucial for firm management, highlighting the importance of ESGD in relation to other financial variables and their effects on market value. This study offers a new perspective on ESGD’s impact, emphasizing the need for differentiated strategies based on ESG commitment levels. © 2024 by author(s).","environmental, social, and governance disclosures (ESGD); profitability of firms; return on assets (ROA); structural equation model; Tobin’s Q (TBQ)","","T.

In addition, this study aims to reveal how this relationship is evaluated within the scope of Vestel and Arçelik enterprises in the white goods sector within the scope of the BIST (Borsa Istanbul) Sustainability 25 Index in Türkiye. For this aim, the relationship between Industry 5.0 and ESG processes was first explained using document analysis, one of the qualitative analysis techniques. Then, descriptive content analysis, which is also one of the qualitative analysis techniques, was used to examine the latest annual reports of Vestel and Arçelik, which are in the white goods sector within the scope of the BIST Sustainability 25 Index in Türkiye, published in 2022. For Industry 5.0, Industry 4.0, environment, employees and society, and finally, the resilience of businesses components were considered, while for the ESG process, environmental, social and governance components were emphasised. NVivo (version 14.23.2) software was used for the analysis. As a result of the study, it was determined that there is a close bidirectional relationship between the components in the Industry 5.0 process and the components in the ESG process. In other words, it can be said that investing in ESG processes will contribute positively to the Industry 5.0 process and investing in the Industry 5.0 process will contribute positively to the ESG process. Within the scope of Industry 5.0 and ESG processes, Vestel and Arçelik have similar studies.

As a consequence, a large number of theoretical and empirical studies, research and professional publications, and guidelines have been published. This trend toward academic scrutiny is a significant change to the traditional way of understanding corporate governance and has led to an increasing number and diversity of stakeholders to which the corporations must be held accountable. Traditionally, corporate governance has focused on “financial” aspects with the aim of improving the protection rights of corporate stakeholders whereas the CSR approach has been limited to the consideration of only economic, social, and environmental issues. However, there has, in the recent past, been a convergence of the four concepts that are increasingly frequently being jointly studied by academics and practitioners. A clear example of this convergence is the use of the ESG criteria in the assessment of sustainable investment portfolios. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present the current state of research on convergence themes (focusing on CSR and CG) in order to present the resulting framework as a basis for the subsequent analysis of the relationship between good governance practices, the CSR, and financial performance.

This is done through investigating the influence of being listed and ranked in the Egyptian Corporate Responsibility Index on firm value during the period starting from 2007 to 2016. Design/methodology/approach: Using univariate and multivariate analyses, the findings support the economic benefits of ESG disclosures. Findings: The authors find that firms listed in the ESG index have higher firm value, and that there is a positive association between firms’ higher rankings in the index and firm value, as measured by Tobin’s q. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide feedback to regulators and standard-setters in the developing countries, and more specifically the Egyptian regulators, on the benefits associated with the introduction of the sustainability index (Standard & Poor’s (S&P)/EGX ESG index). This, in turn, clarifies how the government’s efforts to promote ESG provide benefits to publicly traded firms. Practical implications: By linking ESG to firm value, the ESG index will enable investors to take a leading role in inducing firms to enhance transparency and disclosure, and hence, improving their reporting standards. This, in turn, will ultimately result in improving sustainability and governance practices in Egypt. Social implications: The reported positive market reactions to social and governance practices disclosures can motivate firms to improve their social and governance performance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by addressing the combined economic effects of social and governance disclosures on firm value, and by investigating the economic effects of such disclosures on firm value in an emerging market. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Egypt; Emerging economies; ESG; Firm value","","A.

Based on 168 samples of Thai participants, survey research with an online questionnaire tool was employed to collect the data with structural equation modelling (SEM) to test hypotheses and verify the conceptual framework of this study. The results showed that all environmental, social, and governance activities significantly affect brand image and customers’ purchase intentions. For brand image as a consequence of ESG activities, social activities (b = 0.511) play the strongest role, followed by environmental (b = 0.482) and governance (b = 0.434) activities. On the other hand, environmental activities (b = 0.420) of the ESG concept strongly influence customers' purchase intentions, followed by social (b = 0.395) and governance activities (b = 0.309). Additionally, the moderation analysis found that the effects of ESG activities on brand image and purchase intentions vary depending on gender, age, and education level. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the ESG concept for both academics and practitioners. This paper offers implications and recommendations for further research based on the outcomes. © Authors retain all copyrights.","Brand Image; Environmental activities; Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG); Purchase Intention; SEM; Thailand","Purchasing; Scanning electron microscopy; Brand image; Environmental activities; Environmental concerns; Environmental, social, and governance; Governance activities; Power; Purchase intention; Social activities; Structural equation models; Thailand; Sales","S.

However, the successful establishment of an effective mechanism relies on proper supervision and guidance. Therefore, implementing a value assessment system for long-term care service quality management is of paramount importance. Using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach can provide effective conditions for the establishment of such system and enable a more comprehensive and objective evaluation of long-term care service quality. Using this system, decision-makers can incorporate different indicators based on various needs and weights to evaluate the quality and performance of long-term care services. This facilitates the determination of priorities and the formulation of improvement strategies, thereby enhancing the quality of long-term care services. This study develops an information-based assessment model for a platform that is win-win for both institutions and individuals. The model incorporates consumer reputation and environmental social governance (ESG) dimensions, in addition to indicators such as operational and management efficiency, professional care quality, safety and environmental facilities, and protection of individual rights and interests. Further, it integrates multiple indicator items and employs the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to decompose and structure complex multi-dimensional issues, thereby aligning itself with current corporate evaluations. It aims to assist care service agencies in making key service quality decisions across different dimensions, and enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of those agencies, while increasing public trust and recognition in the evaluation of care service quality. © 2024 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

It is related not only to introducing the concept of circular economy, but also to building and integrating closed-loop supply chains. It includes different aspects of buyer-supplier relationships, such as supplier selection and evaluation. The aim of this article is to determine the scope of use of supplier environmental evaluation and the possibilities for the development of this concept. Methods: The focal study has an exploratory character. The research methods used are the review of the literature and a survey conducted using the computer-aided telephone interview (CATI) technique. The reviewed literature is related to the areas of supplier environmental evaluation and supplier assessment. The empirical study focusses on different areas of supplier environmental evaluation and supplier assessment environmental criteria using a novel approach not found in the literature. Results: The results refer to the possibilities of practical application of the supplier environmental evaluation. One of these possibilities is to link different areas of supplier environmental evaluation with specific environmental criteria of supplier assessment. Conclusions: The main implication for business is to focus activities related to reducing negative environmental impacts mainly on the compliance of the supplier with the buyer's needs and requirements related to the environmental performance and limiting environmental impacts.

However, limited understanding of ESG mechanisms hampers effective management strategies. To address this challenge, this study constructs an ESG introduction mechanism framework based on Bayesian networks and machine learning algorithms. Using Zhengzhou, a major city in China, as a case study, the research employs quantitative methods to identify key factors influencing ESG introduction. The findings reveal that attitudes towards ESG-related construction products, the establishment of corporate brand image, and ESG readiness are the three primary factors driving ESG introduction among construction enterprises. Further scenario simulation analyses indicate that a positive attitude towards ESG significantly enhances the likelihood of successful ESG introduction. Additionally, fostering and expanding local ESG consulting and service agencies and strengthening regulatory measures markedly improve the success rate of ESG introduction. This framework provides construction enterprise managers with a practical tool to analyze ESG introduction mechanisms and offers critical decision-making support for policymakers in designing policies to promote ESG introduction. © 2025 The Authors","Bayesian network; Chinese construction firms; ESG introduction; Machine learning; Sustainable development","Bayes Theorem; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Construction Industry; Machine Learning; Sustainable Development; China; Henan; Zhengzhou; Decision making; Federated learning; Project management; Sustainable city; Bayesia n networks; Chinese construction firm; Construction enterprise; Construction firms; Effective management; Enterprise IS; Environmental, social, and governance introduction; Governance mechanisms; Machine-learning; Management strategies; Bayesian analysis; decision making; environmental impact; governance approach; machine learning; policy making; quantitative analysis; simulation; social impact; sustainable development; article; Bayesian network; China; controlled study; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; simulation; sustainable development; Bayes theorem; building industry; environmental protection; sustainable development; Adversarial machine learning","J.

The mechanisms by which ESG performance affects corporations primarily include the “governance effect” and the “window-dressing effect.” Aimed at high-quality development goals, what kind of impact does ESG performance have on corporate competitiveness? This paper attempts to explore the economic relationship between corporate ESG performance and corporate competitiveness in China's capital market through theoretical analysis and empirical testing. The research results show that ESG performance significantly promotes corporate competitiveness, particularly through the “social” dimension (S) and “governance” dimension (G). ESG performance significantly enhances corporate competitiveness by increasing corporate philanthropic donations and improving total factor productivity, demonstrating the “governance effect” of ESG. However, in the “environmental” dimension (E), ESG performance instead leads to an increase in corporate carbon emissions, which may indicate that corporate efforts in environmental areas are more for superficial appearance, exhibiting the “window-dressing effect” of ESG.

Donating food to food banks is socially responsible, as it improves local communities and reduces waste generation. It also diverts food to a secondary, quality-differentiated market. Academic/practical relevance: In this paper, we quantify the economic impacts of this secondary market for food by examining donation and pricing behaviors for competing retailers. Methodology: We use a structural model of price-discriminating oligopoly retailers to study the effect of food donations on store and category-level demand and equilibrium prices. Empirically, we estimate the food donation effect using a unique data set of food donations and sales for several categories of perishable foods across two major retail chains that compete in the same market. Results: The competitive effects of food donations follow from the price-discrimination logic. First, food donations create a direct demand effect. Donations raise the average quality of products on display, shifting demand curves inward and rotating them clockwise (e.g., more inelastic). Second, food donations create a market enhancement effect, softening price competition and raising equilibrium prices among competing retailers. Managerial implications: Food donations increase food prices and store profits, tying the socially responsible option to an economic benefit. This study contributes a new type of reuse operation to the literature on closed-loop supply chains.

Several studies have analysed the implications of CSR for TQM and vice versa, to form a large and articulated body of knowledge. This body of knowledge, however, is still poorly organised. There are not many studies that systematically analyse it, trace its profile or lines of future development. To fill this gap, in this article, we present the results of a systematic review of the literature at the intersection of the themes of CSR and TQM.

Nevertheless, the absence of universally accepted standards for measuring ESG risk and impact, along with the difficulty of identifying the materiality of ESG aspects, makes assessing ESG ratings challenging. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art literature on studies that describe and evaluate ESG rating methodologies and the impact of ESG factors on credit risk, debt and equity costs, and sovereign bonds. We also expand on the topic of ESG research by including a literature strand that focuses on the impact of climate change on financial stability. The reviewed studies suggest that positive ESG ratings are associated with an improvement in credit ratings, a reduction in credit default swap spreads, and a decrease in the costs of equity capital and debt. Finally, we consider the literature discussing the currently predominant sustainable investment (SI) strategies (negative screening and divestment) and their real limited effectiveness, but also suggesting several potential solutions for more appropriate SI strategies, a clearer standardized definition of climate change risk, a better alignment between private profit and social welfare and mostly an ESG focus on outcomes rather than on activities. With regard to the relationship between climate change and credit risk, the literature agrees on the need for adequate scoreboards and an improved disclosure process to address the problem of insufficient data availability and data quality. © 2024 M.

The authors aim to identify and discuss influential aspects of ESG accounting in Africa, focusing on prominent themes, authors and journals in published articles using Africa’s setting. It also constructs agendas for future research to advance the literature and contribute to the ESG accounting practices in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an SLR approach, where accounting research journal articles are collated and compiled according to pre-determined criteria and analysed using bibliometric techniques. After carefully reviewing 1,387 articles, the authors selected and examined 246 academic articles published from 2006 to 2024 in 32 accounting journals indexed in the Web of Science. Findings: The authors identify four main streams of ESG accounting research in Africa, namely, ESG disclosure in primary-based economies; corporate governance dynamics in Africa; internal mechanisms in ESG reporting; and external mechanisms in ESG disclosure. According to the analysis, the authors propose future research agendas to discuss institutional perspective of ESG reporting standards implementation and enforcement; value creation impact on sustainability performance; ESG reporting effect on conflict resolution; and ESG reporting quality and environmental sustainability. Research limitations/implications: This study assists policymakers, academics, managers, accounting professionals and investors in comprehensively understanding the current state and projecting future actions to develop ESG accounting in Africa. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is perhaps the first to examine Africa’s ESG research through an SLR. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive analysis of the existing ESG accounting landscape and tailoring future research agendas based on the distinctive characteristics of Africa. © 2025, Samuel Karanja Kogi, Ari Budi Kristanto and June Cao.","Africa’s environment; Research agenda; Research streams; Social and governance accounting research; Systematic literature review","","J.

Though past studies investigated COVID-19’s impact on firm performance, there is consensus on the role of firms’ Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosures between firm performance and the pandemic. With this view, the study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on firms’ financial performance with the moderating role of Environmental, Social, and Governance performance disclosure. To do so, the study retrieved data of Nifty 500 index companies from the Bloomberg database for a sample period ranging from 2016 to 2022. To this end, the study performed the fixed-effect regression and GMM model. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of the pandemic on Return on Assets (β =-4.812), Return on Equity (β =–.675), and Earnings Per Share (β = –2.875), highlighting the unfavorable effect of the pandemic on firm performance. Further results showed that firms’ Environmental, Social, and Governance performance disclosure positively moderates the connection between COVID-19 and Return on Assets (β = 3.231), Return on Equity (β = 0.032), and Earnings Per Share (β = 1.523), respectively. This indicates that companies actively involved in Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosure are less likely to suffer during the pandemic in terms of financial performance due to their ESG disclosures. © G.

The extractive industries are believed to have unique strengths to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Nonetheless, companies are expected to be transparent and accountable not only to investors but to all stakeholders, including communities, suppliers, clients, employees, and governments. Therefore, extractive industries require effective sustainability accounting and reporting to transition and contribute to sustainable development. Through a data-driven approach, this paper examines the scope and consistency of sustainability indicators used in the sustainability reports of eight oil and gas and eight mining companies from 2012 to 2018. Through content analysis and relevant statistical methods, we analyze the ways in which companies reported on their contributions to sustainable development, with a focus on indicators used and trends over time both within each industry and between industries. We demonstrate that extractive industries’ sustainability reporting practices are not consistent over time and that internal issues are better represented than external issues, in particular transportation and supply chain issues. Furthermore, while there are similar trends across the industries in terms of social and environmental indicator reporting, there are significant differences in economic reporting. We conclude that although both industries have established sustainability reporting practices, there are trends that demonstrate what companies are focusing on more, as well as areas for improvement. We see this as an initial step for conceptualizing how these industries can more objectively, consistently, and effectively assess and contribute to sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

The change in the relationship between CSR and CFP in the context of internationalization was studied systematically using regression analysis. The study’s results indicate that corporate internationalization exercises a significant and negative moderating effect on the relationship between shareholder-oriented CSR and CFP across the whole sample. In addition, corporate internationalization significantly moderates the relationship between different dimensions of CSR and CFP when the sample is further divided into labor-intensive, capital-intensive and technology-intensive enterprises; and that such moderating impacts vary across the three subsets of enterprises.

Cluster Analysis (CA) and Factor Analysis (FA) grouped and validated the data, while PLS-SEM assessed associations between latent and observable variables. FIMIX-PLS analyzed sample segmentation, and PROMETHEE-ROC ranked significant ESG criteria. Findings revealed that ESG criteria significantly influence workers' perceptions of corporate sustainability, with multidimensional FA elucidating 71 % of latent traits and PLS-SEM parameters demonstrating strong model fit.

Companies are therefore challenged to reorient their production systems and turn the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity into an opportunity for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we analyze the interest of institutional investors in these corporate policies through the role they play in the disclosure that companies make about them. For a balanced data panel of 8,320 firm-year observations from 832 global companies operating in different sectors of activity over the period 2011–2020, the results obtained indicate that institutional investors, especially those with investment a long-term investment horizon, are interested in biodiversity commitments and exercise their demand for information on these initiatives through their representatives on the board of directors. Furthermore, we show that companies are rewarded for disclosing relevant information on business policies, biodiversity management, and the valuation of ecosystem services in the value chain. © 2023 The Authors.

The transition to a circular economy, which entails shifting from the current ‘take-use-dispose’ model to a closed-loop system, emerges as a pragmatic approach to curbing waste generation. This study therefore aims to identify the enablers and barriers associated with adopting circular economy practices in the management of medicines waste within hospital pharmacies, examining practices in both the United Kingdom and Kuwait. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this research is validated using empirical data gathered through qualitative interviews (Phase one, n = 29) and quantitative questionnaires (Phase two, n = 86). Key themes were identified in the qualitative data and supported by quantitative results, these were: Barriers and Enablers (Cognitive, Structural and Cultural) and CE Practices (Circulation of products and Eliminating waste and pollution). 89% of the total sample confirmed that legislation was a key barrier to CE adoption. Sustainable design of products and packaging was considered a priority by a large proportion of the respondent sample (89%), but technology was seen to be unsupportive in advancing CE agendas (90% confirmation across both samples). The sharing of medication with other hospital pharmacies was deemed a sensible approach with 75% of the Kuwait sample favouring this. Sharing stock within UK NHS Trusts was practiced but not between Trusts. To maximise the use of products in circulation nearly half of UK participants said they repackaged medications to reduce wastage. Embracing circular economy principles in hospitals’ management of medicines waste presents a promising strategy that can not only enhance national eco-friendly supply chain management practices but also mitigate medicines waste, bolster sustainability efforts, and alleviate disposal costs. Frameworks are proposed to overcome barriers to CE and support pharmacy operational activity promoting higher levels of circular practice. © Crown 2025.","Circular economy; Circularity; Hospitals; Medicines waste management; Pharmaceutical supply chain management; Pharmacy; Sustainability","","L.

Hospitals are a good target for improvement since they are centres of communities, linking together surrounding healthcare facilities and influencing wider determinants of the environment. District and rural hospitals are good sites to start since they serve large populations, have the least sustained energy and clean water supplies and will benefit most from quality improvement. Within hospitals, surgeons and surgical pathways are the ideal places to start decarbonising healthcare. Surgery is a high-resource activity, but it focuses on one patient at a time, allowing measures to be introduced, and their effects closely monitored. Through a mass movement, surgical teams should be able to influence policy-makers for healthcare and industry supply chains, amplifying their effect. This article describes how we can make personal, professional and organisational changes to start creating impact. Change can be hard, especially in healthcare, so this new community needs to blend carbon literacy and behavioural change techniques for success.

This study uses panel data of 275 firms from 2010 to 2018 of German firms, to explore the impact of female directors on the board of corporate environmental, social and governance performance. Through OLS, 2SLS and GMM model, this study found that the high percentage of female directors on the board is more likely to enhance the corporate environmental, social and governance performance and corporate social responsibility strategy. The policy “Act on Equal Participation” in Germany that makes it mandatory for companies to increase the percentage of female directors will increase the positive impact of female director on corporate environmental, social and governance performance. In addition, this study separates environmental, social and corporate governance and explores the relationship with female directors.

In the present study, we argue that COVID-19 is an extreme event where the effect of ESG sharply manifests. We rely on cross-sectional data in the context of G20 countries for the year 2020. To avoid biased results due to governments support, we integrate four novel metrics provided by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). We run sequential regressions (OLS; and quartiles to account for the Ingrained Income Bias (IIB) and ESG scores). We also perform robustness tests and account for the interaction between ESG and cash level. Our models were subsequently replicated for each ESG pillar. Findings indicate that ESG is beneficial during COVID-19, but the reward appears to be closely tied up to specific aspects of ESG, income level, and firm-specific variables.

Moreover, with the help of quantitative data, we have analyzed the effect of ESG on high-growth business strategy. Method: A quantitative study was conducted for the test of hypothesis for which the data of 174 respondents was collected with the assistance of a self-administered questionnaire. The information was gathered from the IT companies of different states of India, and for the analysis of data, Correlation and multiple regression was employed with the help of SPSS. Result: The analysis of data has concluded that incorporating ESG from starting itself as a high growth strategy will give a huge boom to the young companies to establish themselves well and have a successful starting. It can be done through starting from the basics, Strengthening the core and Communicating the efforts. All three factors, environment, social, and governance, positively influence the growth strategies of young companies. Moreover, the governance factor was the strongest analyst of growth strategies in young companies, which means that the governance factor greatly influences the growth strategies of young companies. Limitations: The current study is specifically concentrated in India. It is consisted of three variables of ESG where more variables can be included in the scale for increasing the credibility of the scale in the future. Practical implications: The study will help the industries, especially young companies, focus on the ESG concerns as these factors are highly influential for the success and growth of the companies from starting. It has highlighted the easy integration of ESG from starting and embraces the idea of re-evaluating and redefining the strategies and functioning activities to progress and endure profitability.

Additionally, the effects of industry sector, firm size, and governance practices on transparency are examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data were retrieved from Bloomberg using the financial analysis environmental, social and governance function for companies comprising the S&P 500 index. Descriptive statistics are provided on each of the three components separately (ESG). Nonparametric procedures are used to test for significant differences in transparency within each of these three areas based on industry sector. Additionally, nonparametric tests are used to determine the impact of firm size (market capitalization) and governance factors (board size, board gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, and linking executive compensation to ESG disclosure) on the composite ESG score. Findings: Descriptive statistics reveal that S&P 500 companies differ in their level of disclosure across the three areas (ESG). The highest level of transparency is found on Governance and the lowest on Environmental. Moreover, there is much variability in the percentage of S&P 500 companies disclosing information about specific Social policies (e.g. child labor). Significant differences in transparency on both the Social and Governance dimensions are found between certain industry sectors. The results also reveal that large-cap companies have significantly higher ESG disclosure scores than mid-cap companies and that governance factors impact ESG disclosure. Significantly, higher ESG disclosure scores are observed for S&P 500 firms with larger boards of directors, with boards that are more gender diverse, that allow CEO duality, and that link executive compensation to ESG scores. Originality/value: This study focuses on corporate transparency through a granular analysis of ESG disclosure scores when most other studies have been primarily conducted at the macro level. Stakeholders, analysts, and shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing firms’ sustainability disclosures in their assessment of management quality, as it reflects on the practices/policies that are employed to improve firms’ environmental and social footprints. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accountability; ESG disclosures; SP 500; Sustainability; Transparency","","N.

This case study introduces a novel Quality Deterioration Index (QDI) to systematically identify and prioritize root causes of non-quality costs within a leading electronics manufacturer. The primary objective is to integrate sustainable quality management practices that align with green sustainability objectives, such as reducing electronic waste, improving energy efficiency, and minimizing hazardous materials usage. Our comprehensive methodology encompasses a literature review, interviews, document analysis, and statistical analysis of survey data to uncover the influence of procedural, cultural, and environmental factors on quality deviations. The key findings reveal critical areas for improvement, particularly in supply chain inefficiencies, workforce challenges, and procedural gaps. By employing the QDI, we provide a structured framework that enhances both operational efficiency and environmental performance. The novelty of this research lies in its dual approach to simultaneously address economic and environmental performance, offering actionable insights for manufacturers aiming to integrate robust quality management systems with sustainability objectives. This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable manufacturing strategies, underscoring the pivotal role of quality management in achieving both economic viability and environmental stewardship. Future research should expand this approach across various industries and global contexts to validate and refine the integration of quality management and sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.","cost of poor quality in green practices; eco-friendly manufacturing processes; environmental impact of quality control; green manufacturing initiatives; industrial systems engineering; operational efficiency and sustainability; quality deterioration index; root cause analysis; sustainable process optimization; sustainable quality management","detection method; manufacturing; profitability; statistical analysis; sustainability","S.

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with companies operating in Italy, the present paper seeks to narrow this gap in current understanding by examining how firms react to ESG ratings, and the factors influencing their response. Unique to the literature, we show that firms may react very differently to being rated, with our analysis yielding a fourfold typology of corporate responses. The typology captures conformity and resistance to ratings across two dimensions of firm behaviour. We furthermore show that corporate responses depend on managers’ beliefs regarding the material benefits of adjusting to and scoring well on ESG ratings and their alignment with corporate strategy. In doing so, we challenge the idea that organisational ratings homogenise organisations and draw attention to the agency underlying corporate responses. Our findings also contribute to debates about the impact of ESG ratings, calling into question claims about their positive influence on companies’ sustainability performance. We conclude by discussing the wider empirical, theoretical and ethical implications of our paper. © 2020, The Author(s).","Corporate response; ESG; Investors; Rating; Sustainability","","R.

ESG can enhance firms' performance and play an incredible role in promoting sustainable development practices. The current study conducts a bibliometric analysis to examine the ESG performance in the manufacturing sector to facilitate a green revolution. It extracted 314 documents from the Scopus and Web of Sciences databases from 1994 to 2023. The average age of the document is 34.78, and it was from 159 sources and involved 896 total authors. The study analyzed the prior literature and supporting theories, current conceptual development, and future research themes. The evolution process of ESG started in the 1960s and is still theoretically and empirically evolving to meet future challenges. Results show an increasing trend in ESG-related publications during the sample period. Journal of Cleaner Production is the primary source of publication, and China is the most prominent country in terms of correspondence and institutional affiliation. The continent-specific analysis indicates that almost 75% of the research was conducted in Asia and Europe. Four research themes were identified through co-occurrence analysis: (1) framework for social, financial, and environmental performance, (2) sustainable models for innovative environmental investment, (3) manufacturing practices and governance issues, and (4) application for eco-friendly production and economic growth. The findings suggest that the manufacturing sector can lead toward a more sustainable and equitable future through a steadfast commitment to ESG performance that can lead to a global green revolution. Further, it outlines the potential future directions integrated into the discourse on sustainable manufacturing. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bibliometric analysis; Eco-friendly production practices; ESG performance; Green revolution; Manufacturing sector; Sustainable development","China; Europe; environmental issue; governance approach; green revolution; industrial performance; manufacturing; social problem; sustainable development","K.I.

In addition, the authors study whether differences in the levels of national commitment to gender-equality policies affect the effectiveness of gender-diverse boards and management in curbing ESG misconduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the role of women directors and women executives in ESG misconduct using a European sample of analysis of 2,994 firm-year observations from 2015 to 2020. Findings: The authors find that gender diversity effectively prevents ESG misconduct only in countries with strong national policies supporting gender equality. Specifically, women directors and executives significantly reduce ESG misconduct in these countries, demonstrating the complementary role of gender diversity and national equality policies. In addition, female chief executive officers are more likely to curb negative ESG practices in firms operating within gender-equal corporate environments, noting that female chief executive officers are not effective in reducing irresponsible ESG behavior when they are not supported by a critical mass of women directors or executives. Practical implications: This paper finds novel evidence that the influence of female representation on ESG misconduct is not linear but conditional on the level of female proportion; women in the minority (usually under 3) can scarcely influence group decisions because their specific female attributes are only evident when the visibility and legitimacy of the female group are high enough. Firms led by female chief executive officers seem to reduce ESG misconduct, especially when their chief suites are above a critical threshold. But queen bee female chief executive officers are not effective in reducing adverse ESG activity if their boards and TMTs are not gender diverse; the joint effect of women in different hierarchical positions contributes to decreasing ESG failures. Social implications: These findings are useful for policymakers because they show that although there is growing social concern about business gender equality and increasing regulatory efforts through soft/hard gender quotas, stakeholders will not completely benefit from firm gender diversity without national support for gender equality. Originality/value: This study contributes to the sustainable development literature by examining the direct effects of gender diversity at multiple levels of a firm’s hierarchy (chief suite, board, TMTs), as well as addressing the gap between firm gender diversity and national gender equality policies as mechanisms to reduce ESG misconduct. It also explores the queen bee phenomenon, noting that female leaders in non-diverse organizations often adapt their leadership style to align with masculine corporate cultures. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical mass; ESG; Female directors; Female executives; Gender equality policies; Misconduct","","J.

Procurement has proved to be one of the strategies for enhancing firm performance without necessarily increasing revenue with its attendant increase in costs. However, rather than investigating the complex asymmetric relationship between procurement practices and firm performance (which this study advocates), past research engaged in a symmetric evaluation of the relationship between the phenomena. Accordingly, this study, using complexity theory, employs fsQCA and NCA on a sample of 150 respondents from private universities in Ghana to (a) identify different combinations of procurement practices, namely procurement planning, supplier partnership, contract management, and compliance, that lead to firm performance and (b) explore the necessity of these procurement practices (in kind and degree) for firm performance. Whereas the findings from fsQCA reveal three distinct combinations of procurement practices for high firm performance and further suggest that none of the procurement practices was necessary for firm performance, the NCA results suggest that two out of the four procurement practices investigated are necessary for firm performance and hence must be present in the causal recipes produced by fsQCA to guarantee that they lead to firm performance. The study offers pathways to firm performance through procurement practices and demonstrates how to complement fsQCA with NCA to ensure that causal recipes produced by fsQCA can produce the outcome. © 2024 The Author","Complexity theory; Compliance; Contract management; Contrarian case analysis; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA); Necessary condition analysis (NCA); Procurement planning; Supplier partnership","","","English","Heliyon","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

By recycling rare earth resources from obsolete equipment, the reliance on newly mined rare earth resources can be reduced, thereby reducing the related environmental and energy footprints and increasing the stability of the supply chain. This study aims to systematically and strategically analyze and discuss the recycling impacts of renewable energy generation (REG)-related rare earth resources in terms of environmental, economic, social, and governance aspects. A SWOT strategical analysis framework integrating a management cycle and intelligent text data mining is built to address the above tasks from an ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) perspective. The SWOT analysis of the rare earth recycling impacts focuses on strengths (e.g., reduced dependence on rare resources, reduced environmental and emission pressure), weaknesses (e.g., high cost, technology and management complexity), opportunities (e.g., policy support, technological innovations, diversification of the global supply chain), and threats (e.g., market volatility, the emergence of alternative materials). This analysis framework reveals textual topic changes and suggests cyclic and strategical improvement pathways to analyze the multi-dimensional recycling impacts. The text data analysis results indicate that the trend of rare earth recycling is gradually transformed from technologies, supply and demand, and secondary resources into resource and environment sustainable development. Beyond overcoming identified challenges, future pathways should focus more on the integration of advanced emerging technologies, life cycle management, and dynamic adjustment of recycling strategies. This study could provide policymakers and industry practitioners with recommendations and outlook on current development status and improvement strategies to promote REG-related rare earth recycling. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Energy transition; Rare earth recycling; Renewable energy; Sustainable development; SWOT analysis","Analysis frameworks; Circular economy; Energy transitions; Global energy; Rare earth recycling; Rare-earth resources; Rare-earths; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; SWOT analysis; alternative energy; data mining; economic conditions; economic impact; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; policy making; rare earth element; recycling; sustainable development; Circular economy","P.

It is urgent and important to protect the environment, promote green transformation, and realize sustainable development. Consequently, increasing attention is being paid to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) actions. This study empirically investigated the effect of companies’ ESG activities on the ESG perceptions and purchase intentions of agricultural food consumers in Hebei Province, China, using structural equation modeling. The results of the study show that, firstly, the environmental and social factors of ESG activities had a significant positive effect on consumer ESG perception while governance had a non-significant effect on consumer ESG perception. Secondly, the environmental, social, and governance components of ESG activities had a significant positive effect on purchase intention. Thirdly, there was a significant mediating effect of consumer ESG perception (environmental and social, excluding governance). The theoretical contribution of this study is to reveal the important role of consumers’ ESG perceptions and to emphasize the unique contribution of governance factors in purchase intentions. In addition, this study supports the effect of ESG activities on agri-food consumer behavior through empirical data, which provides a new theoretical perspective on agri-food retailers’ ESG practices and helps to further promote the green transformation of Chinese agricultural food retailers. © 2024 by the authors.","agricultural food retailers; consumer ESG perception; ESG; purchase intention","China; Hebei; climate change; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis","T.-W.

According to the WHO, 24% of deaths are attributable to environmental health risks and are largely preventable. Current predictions show that rising emissions will be linked to an enormous healthcare burden, especially for high-risk populations and historically disadvantaged communities. The US healthcare industry accounts for nearly 18% of its GDP and is a major consumer of resources. The largest healthcare-related source of greenhouse gas emissions is from the supply chain, including pharmaceuticals, other chemicals, food, and the transportation required to mobilize them accounting for 80% of emissions, with only 20% of emissions from purchased energy and the facilities directly. As a field, radiology has historically monitored its impact in terms of radiation exposure and thermal effects but has not focused on other pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, or waste. Although tackling large issues such as climate change and pollution seems daunting, we can start by raising awareness through education, investigation, and advocacy.

Meanwhile, social performance can influence CSV negatively in the next 2 years. Governance performance has been unable to influence CSV within the observed period of up to the next 4 years. The research novelty is to provide empirical evidence on using sustainability (FBL) that can influence CSV and also a preliminary study in Indonesia. Theoretical implications of this study provide empirical evidence sustainability can influence CSV. Practical implications of this study are to implement sustainability with FBL proxy to create CSV in 2–3 years, the company’s efforts in achieving CSV can be viewed as a long-term investment rather than as an expense, the extent of disclosure of FBL should be improved, to increase the external assessors in assessing the SR (sustainability report), and it is necessary to standardize the disclosure of sustainability reports in collaboration with regulators. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Creating shared value (CSV); Five bottom line; Indonesia; Sustainability; Triple bottom line (TBL)","","L.

The article aims to systematize the state of knowledge on how companies create sustainable value. Research results in this area are dispersed, and more studies discussing this topic comprehensively are needed. The article fills the gap in research by reviewing the existing studies on creating sustainable value. The analysis of publications was based on the academic databases of Elsevier Scopus and Web-of-Science. 101 publications were reviewed, and 31 categorization variables related to the area of research and issues addressed in scientific publications were created. Using a multidimensional correspondence analysis, three homogeneous clusters of publications were obtained: group I refers to articles concerning enterprises of various sizes (micro, small, SME, and start-up); group II includes publications on Asia and Australia, which appeared in 2020 or later; group III concerns articles related to the research of large production companies in developed European countries. The result shows that companies build sustainable value in various ways, influenced by company's location and size.

In recent years, the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has increasingly proven its influence on stocks’ returns, resulting in the evolvement from a two-dimensional (i.e., risks versus returns) into a multi-dimensional setting (e.g., risks versus returns versus ESG). This study is the first to examine this setting in the global energy sector using a (slacks-based measures, SBM) ESG-SR double-frontier double-bootstrap (ESG-SR DFDB) by studying the determinants of the overall ESG-SR efficiency for 334 energy firms from 45 countries in 2019. We show that only around 11% of our sampled firms perform well in the multi-dimensional ESG-SR efficient frontier. The 2019 average (in)efficiency of the global energy sector was 2.273, given an efficient level of 1.000. Besides the differences in the firm’s input/output utilization (regarding their E, S, G, and SR values), we found that the firm- (e.g., market capitalization and board characteristics) and country-level characteristics (e.g., the rule of law) have positive impacts on their ESG-SR performance. Such findings, therefore, are essential not only to the (responsible) investors but also to managers and policymakers in those firms/countries. © 2023, The Author(s).","Bootstrap data envelopment analysis; Double frontier; Environmental, social, and governance (ESG); Portfolio optimization; Sharpe ratio","","T.

In such a scenario, technological change and innovation are pivotal enablers to improve how companies monitor their ESG data for disclosure purposes, and significantly enhance their strategic ESG performance in several ways, such as by reducing emissions and environmental impact. The adoption of digital solutions for ESG performance has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners, leading to a significant increase in scientific production in the past few years. Yet, extant literature appears fragmented and scattered, despite the fast pace at which it is developing. Consequently, the present study conducts a systematic review of 89 distinct contributions ranging from 2017 to 2023, in order to acquire pertinent information regarding the current status of the topic and draw several lines for future research.

Our primary goal was to identify how and whether certain HR practices are critical for developing employee capability to operate in firms with active CSR initiatives. We first examine the impact of external CSR activities on firm-level work outcomes. Moreover, we attempt to identify a choice of particular HR practices that could be aligned with external CSR activities. We then empirically examine how each HR practice interacts with external CSR activities that influence employee retention and labor productivity. Using three longitudinal datasets conducted by the government-sponsored research institution over 154 publicly traded Korean firms for five waves of survey years, the results show that external CSR has a limited impact on employee retention and labor productivity. However, when external CSR activities are combined with a specific set of HR practices, including person-organization fit-based selection, performance-based pay, extensive investment of training and development, and employee suggestion program, the impact of external CSR on employee work outcomes is more substantial. The results indicate that external CSR and a particular set of HR practices as internal CSR can be complementary and generate a positive interaction on creating sustainable human capabilities.

The research underscores the significance of the ESG context in the realm of digitalization, providing valuable insights into its impact on the overall competitiveness of logistics enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: This research gathers information from a total of 90 logistics enterprises that are publicly traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share stock markets for analysis and model testing. Due to the multiple pathways of influence and the constrained size of the sample, it has been decided that the Piecewise structural–equation–modeling (SEM) approach will be employed. Findings: The research reveals that ESG factors positively impact enterprises' competitiveness (EC). The augmentation of competitiveness is attributed to the moderating role of green technology innovation (GTI) and agency costs between ESG and EC. In the context of digitalization, the level of digitalization of logistics enterprises may create a capital squeeze effect on environmental performance, weakening competitiveness. Conversely, the level of digitalization positively regulates the promoting effect of governance performance on competitiveness. Originality/value: This research provides a sound theoretical foundation for understanding how ESG contributes to boosting the competitiveness of Chinese logistics enterprises and extends the application of Piecewise SEM in the research field of logistics enterprise competitiveness. Furthermore, it offers a practical pathway for companies to implement ESG practices and foster competitiveness in digital environments. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitalization; ESG performance; Logistics enterprises’ competitiveness; Piecewise SEM","","S.A.

Ill-sourced minerals not only finance terrorism, human trafficking, and other major issues in society, but they deter deliberately conscientious organizations from their goals of achieving genuinely sustainable products that are considerate towards the environment and society. This paper aims to understand the problem of responsible sourcing from the point of view of the mining and the metallurgical industry. The study helps identify areas of improvement for this global industry to minimize conflict originating from natural resource development and achieve the noble goal of being certified as Conflict Free. Further, existing paths to accreditation are classified into three categories: Certification Approaches, Analytical Approaches, and Inscription Approaches. A comparison of the approaches is given on parameters like accuracy, cost of implementation, and difficulty of implementation. The study finds that although Analytical Approaches appear to be the most feasible among all the other approaches, their extremely high cost of implementation has prevented their wide adoption, thus perpetuating the difficulty of systematically managing the problem of conflict minerals at scale. Finally, the use of Blockchain Technology (BCT) to overcome the limitations of current mineral traceability schemes is given. Due to limited academic research on this topic, the focus was diverted to how other industries have utilized BCT and proposed the next steps for mineral researchers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Mineral provenience; Mineral traceability; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Distributed ledger; Metallurgy; Minerals; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; 'current; Analytical approach; Block-chain; Conflict minerals; Human trafficking; Manufactured goods; Mineral provenience; Mineral traceability; Sustainable products; Web 3.0; certification; metallurgy; mineral resource; research work; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; Blockchain","I.

Design/Methodology/Approach: A systematic qualitative scrutiny aided by nomothetic content analysis from the published papers centred on green procurement as a global strategic approach to protecting the environment was employed. Findings: Green procurement practices are documented as useful for the performance of firms. Moreover, little has been pronounced on relevant practices in Tanzania. Manufacturing firms are charged for environmental compliance and hence call for a related conceptual study. Research Limitation/Implication: The study limited itself to the literature alone out of no cause-effect relationship testing of green procurement practices against performance hence calling for the quantitative study guided by hypothesis testing. Practical Implications: The practical implications of the green procurement nexus on the performance of manufacturing firms are significant and can influence various aspects of a company's operations, sustainability efforts, and overall success. Social Implications: The study contributes to the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) agenda by highlighting the green procurement practices to be taken on board for the social wellbeing of the delivery of materials to manufacturing firms in consistency with the governance mechanisms. Originality/Value: Suggestion: The novelty of the study on the green procurement nexus and manufacturing firm performance lies in its empirical, multidimensional, and forward-looking approach to understanding how sustainable procurement practices can impact various facets of a manufacturing firm's operations and long-term sustainability.

Non-financial trade manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2015 and 2020 were selected for this study. For data estimation, panel regression estimations using OLS and fixed effects models have been used. The results demonstrate a significant moderation of manufacturing industry’s sales growth in China on the relationship between ESG disclosures and sustainable finance (operationalized by green credit, and green investment), and green innovation (operationalized by R&D intensity and green patents). Several practical takeaways are offered to boost green innovation performance among ESG reporting enterprises and increase the effectiveness of R&D intensity.

Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the region's policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations' SDGs.

Additionally, the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on this relationship is tested, given its significance for ESG-related decision-making. Longitudinal analysis of S&P 900 manufacturing firms demonstrates that strong DCCs positively influence ESG performance, supporting dynamic managerial capabilities and upper echelons theories within the institutional and shareholder theory frameworks. The findings also corroborate that BGD has a moderating effect, initially strengthening the DCC–ESG relationship, in line with gender socialization and diversity theories. However, the study reveals a threshold effect, where ESG benefits from DCCs diminish once BGD reaches approximately 35%, providing a new perspective on critical mass theory. © 2023 The Author.

Therefore, the country mainly focuses on sustainable development and green finance. To evaluate the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and policy options for green finance investment decisions in China, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques are employed. The fuzzy AHP method identifies and analyzes the most significant ESG factors and sub-sub-factors to comprehensively understand sustainable investment in China. Furthermore, this study uses the fuzzy DEMATEL method to prioritize the main policy options for advancing sustainable development and green finance investment decisions in China. The fuzzy AHP method shows that the environmental factor (ESG1) is the most significant factor for green finance investment decisions in China, followed by the governance (ESG3) and social factors (ESG2). The fuzzy DEMATEL method results revealed that supporting green finance innovation and development (P1) is the highest priority, followed by encouraging social responsibility and community engagement (P4) and developing and enforcing environmental regulations (P2). The study’s findings will significantly benefit investors and decision-makers who wish to promote sustainable development and make decisions regarding green financing.

Nonetheless, due to differences in methodological and theoretical approaches, more consensus has yet to be reached in the economic literature on the relationship between ESG practices and financial performance at the firm level. This work addresses the question empirically, focusing on a sample of firms listed in the Euro Stoxx 300 index. Three novel indicators are proposed to measure the firm's sustainable practices and capture the business's Environmental, Social, and Governance (E, S, G) dimensions. These indicators combine qualitative ratings on adherence to ESG standards with quantitative observations on ESG data disclosure to account for strategic behaviors on the part of firms. A dynamic panel model is implemented, considering the three dimensions of ESG practices separately and introducing interaction terms to identify cross-dimensional substitutability/complementarity relations. The results indicate that environmentally friendly business practices are associated with increased profits, while trade-offs across ESG dimensions are revealed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate sustainability; Cross-dimensional substitutability; ESG practices","Commerce; Disclosure; Economic and social effects; Sustainable development; Business contexts; Business practices; Corporate-sustainability; Cross-dimensional substitutability; ESG practice; Financial performance; Methodological approach; Sustainable business; Sustainable practices; Theoretical approach; academic research; firm size; profitability; strategic approach; sustainability; Article; commercial phenomena; data quality; energy resource; environmental factor; environmental footprint; environmental management; financial management; sustainable growth; interpersonal communication; Profitability","P.

Despite this, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effect of ESG practices on customers’ brand perception and whether the effects of ESG on brand perception differ depending on product involvement and generational differences. This study aims to assess the effect of ESG on brand love and loyalty in product categories with high and low involvement, as well as in older and younger age groups. Utilizing the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach, we conducted quantitative empirical research using an online questionnaire to examine the proposed model. The findings, based on a sample of 156 Thai respondents, indicate that ESG is significantly and positively related to brand love and loyalty. The result of the mediation analysis revealed that brand love partially mediates the effect of ESG on brand loyalty. The result of the moderation analysis indicates that product involvement has a moderating role between ESG and brand love, and between ESG and brand loyalty. The effects of ESG on brand love and loyalty are larger for low-product-involvement respondents than for high-product-involvement respondents. In addition, the effect of ESG on brand love was found to be stronger among younger age groups than among older age groups. The research underlines the importance of ESG and expands the existing understanding of the concept. Our study, which gives various implications and recommendations, is one of the rare attempts to verify the effects of ESG from the standpoint of customers. © 2023 by the authors.","brand love; brand loyalty; ESG; generational difference; product involvement","empirical analysis; least squares method; numerical model; perception; quantitative analysis; sustainability","S.

Due to high regulatory measures, this topic is becoming one of the most sustainable themes among emerging areas. There is ample literature on ESG as a sustainable business goal (SBG), but only a few studies have identified the factors that encourage the adoption of ESG reporting. The research aims to identify, determine and analyse the enablers of adopting ESG reporting adoption in developing economy India. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the strategic enablers that facilitate adopting ESG reporting practices in India. A thorough literature review and expert interviews were organized to accomplish the study’s goals. Initially identifying 23 enablers through expert interviews, this paper left with nine key enablers. Through an empirical analysis using m-TISM and MICMAC analysis, the current study has formulated the hierarchical structure to determine the relationship between strategic, operational and performance variables. Findings: The research findings highlighted that the variables at the bottom of the model – a regulatory framework for a standardized code of reporting (E1), corporate governance reforms (E2) and regulatory efforts (E3) – are strategic determinants designed for successful ESG reporting adoption. Research limitations/implications: To capitalize on these facilitators, the government must impose mandatory disclosure and advance the policies, rules and advantages of ESG reporting adoption. Encouraging wider adoption involves aiding SMEs in implementing ESG practices and providing incentives like tax relief, incentives or subsidies for outstanding ESG performance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research in the field to use TISM and MICMAC-based hierarchical models to identify and analyse the relationship between strategic ESG enablers for adopting ESG reporting. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Enablers; Environmental; ESG reporting; Governance; JEL Classification M40; M48; Q56; Q560; Social; Structural modelling; Total interpretative","","R.

Stakeholders' increasing interest in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) activities and easy access to information makes maintaining authenticity essential. Any firm caught in hypocrisy risks losing stakeholder trust and damaging its legitimacy. Family firms willing to preserve socioemotional wealth are more susceptible to hypocrisy than general firms due to the family's significant influence on decision-making, including CEO (chief executive officer) turnover and legitimacy crises. This study examined the impact of CSIR (corporate social irresponsibility) on sustainability in two South Korean companies and assessed how internal factors (e.g., CEO turnover and succession) and external factors (e.g., market competition and environmental dynamism) influenced them. To this end, we employed a case study as the central methodology and conducted text mining, interviews, and financial analysis through content analysis. Our first finding is that CSIR negatively affects financial and non-financial performance in family firms. Second, family firms must make genuine efforts to restore their legitimacy. As per the moderation effect of CEO succession, the pivotal consideration is appointing an external CEO rather than whether the subsequent CEO is a family member. Beta chose an external CEO who was a family member, while Alpha selected a long-time company insider who was not a family member as the succeeding CEO. Alpha, which designated an internal nonfamily CEO after the CEO succession, demonstrated a financial performance resilience inferior to Beta. Third, firms must communicate promptly with stakeholders in external conditions. With internationalization and digitalization, stakeholders enjoy a greater array of choices, and the evolution of public media has heightened the prominence of CSIR. The diminishing reliance of stakeholders on a particular company, the active articulation of opinions, and enhanced knowledge magnify the impact of a company's CSIR on the sustainability of family firms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","CEO succession; CEO turnover; Corporate hypocrisy; Corporate social irresponsibility; Environmental dynamism; Family firm; Market competition","Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Finance; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officer succession; Chief executive officer turnover; Corporate hypocrisy; Corporate social irresponsibility; Corporates; Environmental dynamisms; Family firms; Market competition; Sustainable development","T.

Firms strengthen environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities, which are critical elements for sustainable management. However, there are inconsistent findings on the relationship between ESG activities and firms’ financial performance in prior studies because of the lack of full consideration of internal mechanisms and external conditions. To overcome this limitation, this study investigates the mediating effect of non-financial performance and the moderating effect of the institutional environment on the relationship between firms’ ESG activities and their financial performance in a unified moderated mediation model. Sam-ples for empirical analyses were collected by a survey from 304 small and medium-sized Chinese manufacturers. The results of a mediation analysis reveal that each ESG activity has a positive effect on firms’ financial performance, and the impact of ESG activities on financial performance is completely mediated by non-financial performance. The results of a moderated mediation analysis further indicate that the mediating effect varies depending on the level of institutional pressure from the government, consumers, and competitors. The study suggests the need for interdisciplinary research in sustainable management and institutional theory and emphasizes the importance of sustainable management for performance improvement in a changing environment. © 2022 by the authors.

This article fills this gap by investigating whether EM-MNEs can improve ESG performance through digital transformation among Chinese listed companies. We employ text analysis techniques to measure the degree of digital transformation within MNEs and further construct a fixed-effects (FE) model to investigate the positive influence of digital transformation on EM-MNEs’ ESG performance. Results show that digital transformation within MNEs is positively related to ESG performance and such effect is verified for non-state-owned enterprises but not for state-owned enterprises. We suggest that MNEs with more foreign subsidiaries are more prone to be influenced by the positive effect of digital transformation on ESG performance than MNEs with fewer foreign subsidiaries. Moreover, the Belt and Road Initiative is valuable for MNEs to reap ESG benefits from digital transformation. The findings enrich international business studies by adding the digital economy and ESG to the discussion. Moreover, they provide valuable implications for policymakers and business leaders in emerging markets by delineating strategies for enhancing the ESG performance of EM-MNEs. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital transformation; Emerging market; ESG performance; MNEs","","Y.

The paper's novelty is the industry-specific perspective and results that are scarce and indicate a mixed influence of the ESG subsets. The results obtained by regression analysis underline a non-significant positive relationship between ESG and ROA, meaning ESG activities are valued less than expected. Interestingly, the market's valuation, which Tobin's Q should capture, has presented some significant influence. That implies that investors value ESG performance in the long term, which is particularly relevant information for decision-makers in the automotive industry. © 2023, Czestochowa University of Technology.

The urgency is such that the first draft of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the Convention of Biological Diversity has a specific target aimed at full sustainability in biodiversity practices in businesses by 2030. Brazil—a country with the greatest reservoir of biodiversity and the 12th largest economy on the planet —should be fertile ground for new developments and innovations on this front. However, the shortage of academic engagement with businesses in the country may impede this path. We propose six biodiversity-related innovation fronts and opportunities for engagement between high education institutions and companies in Brazil. We reviewed the literature regarding two sets of practices: pressing issues (including environmental licensing, biodiversity offsets, and conservation in private reserves), and new business opportunities (sustainable bioeconomy, access and benefit sharing – ABS, and environmental and social governance – ESG). Such themes have direct relevance to the Post-2020 GBF business sustainability target and potential national impact. There is plenty of room for academic engagement with businesses in all cases. Examples include supporting definition of metrics and standards, providing information systems to increase transparency, among others. In conclusion, we argue that an innovative mindset from corporations and academics will be necessary before Brazilian businesses can move on to develop innovative and sustainable processes and products related to biodiversity. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Academic engagement; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity offsets; Bioeconomy; Private reserves","","A.C.F.

However, it has still not been able to bring out comprehensive results because of using a single metric to measure performance. Due to that, this research will: (i) use the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to measure transportation firms’ performance and (ii) use OLS regression to explore the relationship between ESG combined score and business performance. In the first stage, we found out that 43 out of 56 firms work inefficiently. The managers of those companies should utilize their resources and refer to the benchmarking as a sample to follow. The environmental and social scores positively affect business performance in the second stage. Thus, managers should consider ESG as an investment, primarily when transportation is categorized as an “environmentally sensitive industry”. Besides, investors should pay more attention to a company that has ESG activities because that firm has the chance to improve its business performance and deal with its commitments. © 2022 by the authors.

It aimed to discern how corporate governance affects these firms, focusing on both medium and larger-sized companies. The central research question was: How do board characteristics impact the ESG performance of automobile companies? Data from Thomson Reuters Eikon for 32 automobile companies, spanning 2005 to 2021, were analyzed, with the companies categorized into medium (15) and larger-sized (17) classifications. The study employed random and fixed effect models and utilized Hausman specification tests to validate the consistency and efficiency of the fixed effect model against the random effect model. To address endogeneity, a two-step robust GMM methodology was applied. Results revealed intriguing findings: board gender diversity and meetings had a negative and insignificant impact on ESG performance, while non-executive directors had a detrimental and significant effect. Conversely, board size, educational background, CEO dual roles, and independent board members positively and significantly influenced ESG performance in these automobile companies. Given the significant impact identified, it is recommended to reconsider the composition of non-executive directors. A more balanced approach could mitigate the observed detrimental effect on ESG performance. © 2024 The Authors","Automobile companies; Corporate governance; ESG performance; Shareholders; Tokyo stock market","","R.

Research suggests that ESG performance enhances firm performance and that enterprise innovation has an intermediary effect, which is adjusted by digital transformation. Digital transformation provides “big data technology” and other means to effectively and intelligently promote enterprise innovation and enhance the role of ESG performance in promoting enterprise performance. Heterogeneity indicates that, compared to state-owned, high-tech, and heavily polluting firms, the ESG performance of non-state-owned, high-tech, and non-heavily polluting enterprises has a stronger effect on firm performance.

The AROMAN (Alternative Ranking Order Method Accounting for two-step Normalization) method was further used to rank the ten alternative sectors, with impact investing funds emerging as the top choice, followed by renewable energy and sustainable responsible investment funds. Conversely, ESG-compliant stocks, ESG-focused exchange-traded funds, and ESG-focused real estate investment trusts ranked the lowest.

However, it is currently unclear whether and how carbon reduction policies can help energy companies improve their ESG performance. Therefore, this paper comprehensively examines the impact of carbon reduction policies on the ESG performance of energy companies. First, we use the content analysis method to construct a novel index as a proxy of policy influence based on policy text, i.e., the carbon reduction policy effectiveness (CRPE) index. Then, we empirically examine the impact of CRPE on the ESG performance of energy companies using the panel data of Chinese A-share listed energy companies from 2010 to 2022. The empirical study shows that the CRPE can significantly improve the ESG performance of energy companies and remains robust to robustness tests. Mechanism tests show that it is due to the increase in executives with environmental backgrounds and executive compensation. For the three indicators (E, S, and G) of ESG performance, CRPE promotes environmental and social performance but reduces governance performance. Notably, the effect of CRPE on the ESG performance of clean energy companies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is more significant. These findings enrich environmental economic theories and provide a reference for energy companies to promote ESG practices and the low-carbon transition, helping to accelerate the process of carbon neutrality. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon reduction policy; Content analysis methods; ESG performance; Listed energy companies; Policy effectiveness","","Z.

We conducted an empirical analysis of Korean SMEs and obtained the following results: First, environmental management capabilities have a significant, positive effect on SMEs’ non-financial performance. Second, ESG pressure has a significant, negative effect on the non-financial performance of SMEs. Next, we analyzed the moderating effect of ESG pressures and observed that ESG pressures strengthen the positive effect of environmental management capabilities on non-financial performance. Based on the resource-based perspective and institutional theory, this study provides meaningful academic implications by examining environmental management capabilities and ESG pressures, which have not been identified in previous studies, as factors of non-financial performance that are becoming important under the new management paradigm, such as climate change and ESG. Furthermore, while ESG pressure has a significant negative effect on non-financial performance, we find that it is a moderating variable that strengthens the relationship between SMEs’ environmental management capabilities and non-financial performance, which has useful academic and practical implications for ESG and strategic management. © 2023 by author(s).","environmental management capabilities; ESG pressures; non-financial performance; SMEs","","J.-E.

However, greenwashing undermines the credibility of this initiative, presenting a decision dilemma for stakeholders. Involving principal stakeholders (enterprises, investors, rating agencies) in ESG disclosure, this study conducts an evolutionary game analysis to explore the strategic evolution mechanisms. The equilibrium results suggest the potential market dilemma stemming from deceptive enterprises and unreliable rating agencies. Meanwhile, the system can converge to an ideal state without greenwashing. Reaching this state necessitates a market-based approach combined with government regulations, such as the ongoing monitoring of rating agencies to provide truthful and stringent ESG evaluation. Additionally, mandatory enterprise ESG disclosure is a robust measure to curb greenwashing. Investment-returns-based solutions can be considered for investors to augment the rigorous ESG ratings. Managers should understand the impact factors and evolution paths in ESG disclosure and how to deal effectively with greenwashing. © The Author(s) 2025.","ESG disclosure; Evolutionary game; Greenwashing; Mechanism analysis; Tripartite players","","T.

There is a consensus that low and high ESG firms' discrimination is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ESG investing. Moreover, it is one thing for fund managers to claim that they are integrating ESG factors in their portfolios and another to do it properly. The restriction of the strategy space, internal and external transaction costs, and data quality are still viewed as overwhelming obstacles for seamlessly integrating ESG into financial portfolios. Sentiment analysis indicates that asset managers hold a negative view of ESG investing, surprising as ethical investing is becoming increasingly common. Unlocking the potential positive externalities from ESG investing may require regulators and investors' actions to improve the quality of information disclosure and pressure fund managers into incorporating nonfinancial criteria in their investment models. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","asset managers; ESG indicators; ethical investing; fiduciary duty; portfolio optimization","climate change; environmental economics; ethics; finance; governance approach; investment; optimization","R.

The presence of these activities in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is still in its early stages in the literature, requiring further empirical evidence. Given the importance of SMEs in economy and based on Stakeholder Theory, a set of hypotheses regarding the influence of ESG on financial and risk performance has been tested using a sample of 538 Spanish SMEs. Specifically, an index has been developed to assess ESG at both global and individual levels. The study analyses the impact of these variables on corporate performance, taking into account factors such as the pandemic period, level of disclosure and the size effect. The results demonstrate the importance of developing and index tailored to measuring ESG within this type of company, as the methodology employed can impact the outcomes. Moreover, at the individual level, all dimensions reflect a significant relationship, but the overall ESG score does not. The social and labor dimensions prove to be the most beneficial indices for enhancing resilience during periods of crisis. Finally, the findings confirm that it is more difficult for SMEs to monetize the results of ESG investment and that disclosing these activities has a positive impact.

Using a 2011-2022 dataset from A-share listed manufacturing companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, the study employs multiple regression analysis with a two-way fixed-effects model to examine these relationships. Findings indicate that robust ESG practices significantly enhance company performance, mediated by green technological innovation. However, a negative moderating effect of corporate reputation suggests that higher corporate reputation weakens the ESG-financial performance relationship. Further analyses reveal that privately-owned firms, those in China's eastern region, and environmentally sustainable industries benefit most from strong ESG initiatives. This study addresses the challenge of disentangling key variables by analyzing their interconnected effects. The findings fill a gap in the existing literature by contributing to a deeper understanding of the relationship between ESG and corporate success, particularly through the mediating role of innovation and the moderating influence of reputation.

Empirical results indicate that ESG performance contributes to improving the quality of firms and exhibits a certain degree of persistence. Among the three components, governance performance has the greatest impact, followed by social performance, while environmental performance is not significant. Mechanism research shows that ESG performance enhances corporate quality by alleviating financing constraints and improving labour productivity.

This study constructs a dataset from 2010 to 2022 with subsidiary-year observations as the unit of analysis, using data on 1364 subsidiaries across 31 countries whose parent firms are 548 Chinese-listed companies. Our analysis reveals a positive relationship between parent firms’ ESG disclosures and the financial performance of overseas subsidiaries.

Design/methodology/approach: To obtain a more comprehensive measurement of ESG performance, this study used both Refinitiv Eikon and Bloomberg ESG scores, while previous studies typically used one ESG score measurement. The test was conducted on cross-country samples of 5,980 observations over 2016–2023. The mediation effect was tested using the three-stage least squares method developed by Baron and Kenny (1986). The Oster test was done to address endogeneity issues that become a matter of concern in determining the estimation model used in this study. Findings: Empirical results show that ESG performance positively affects investment efficiency, and financial reporting quality mediates the positive effects of ESG performance on investment efficiency. The results of this study indicate that ESG performance will reduce agency problems, thus increasing investment efficiency. This implies that high ESG performance and good financial reporting quality are determining factors for companies to invest more efficiently. Originality/value: This study reveals how ESG performance affects investment efficiency mediated by financial reporting quality, which has never been discussed in other studies.

Following design science framework conventions and running design workshops that integrate design thinking of “how might we” design questions, literature analysis, and expert interviews across disciplines, this study presents findings regarding three main activities—consulting, reporting, and communicating. Based on the iterations of design workshops that adopt a circular economy-based partner map design canvas for stakeholder analysis with procedures such as expert interviews and literature analysis, three partner/capability maps were generated to map stakeholders and explore the capabilities needed. ESG and carbon information digital and data skills emerged as the core capability to complete all the three tasks. A conceptual framework—a Smart System of ESG and Carbon Information—is proposed to summarize planning, operating, and communicating with ESG and carbon information, along with high-level organizational actions and talent capabilities. It identifies the building blocks of an ESG operating system within an enterprise to engage various stakeholders for value-creation collaboration. Despite the limitation of a lack of comprehensive review and limited geographic and disciplinary representation, this study provides a roadmap for enterprises and universities to explore and define talent requirements and create specific education and training programs.

Consumers, stakeholders and investors alike seek companies that can show that they are environmentally and socially responsible, especially in periods of uncertainty. Using a new measure of uncertainty, the Climate Policy Uncertainty Index developed by Gavriilidis (Measuring climate policy uncertainty, 2021), this study investigates environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, firm performance and carbon dioxide emission performance in the context of major developments related to climate policy and events. Further, the study provides insights into how ESG performance moderates the impact of climate policy uncertainty on firm performance and carbon dioxide emission performance. Finally, this paper examines how investor sentiment influences ESG performance during periods of high uncertainty. Based on a large sample of 2640 firms (6462 firm-year observations) from the US Fortune 1000 list covering the years 2008–2018, the empirical results demonstrate that climate policy uncertainty positively affects ESG performance and negatively affects firm performance and carbon dioxide emission performance. In addition, we find that firms enhance their ESG performance when investors are pessimistic, especially during periods of high uncertainty. Finally, we show that ESG performance does not moderate the effects of climate policy uncertainty on firm performance and carbon dioxide emission performance. These findings may help managers and policymakers to boost ESG performance to reap the benefits of ESG activities during periods of uncertainty related to changes in climate policy. Further, the results identify a promising channel via investor power that the government and ESG reporting advocates can utilise to encourage firms to act responsibly during periods of uncertainty. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Carbon dioxide emission performance; Climate policy uncertainty; ESG performance; Firm performance; Investor sentiment","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental policy; industrial performance; policy making; uncertainty analysis","A.

Integrating the perspectives of stakeholder theory and signaling theory, this study employed the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index, fixed-effects regression model, mediating effect model, propensity matching score difference-in-differences model, and a two-stage least squares method. Using the research sample of Chinese A-share listed companies between 2011 and 2021, the mechanisms linking ESG ratings and each component (the individual scores of E, S, and G) with the green innovation and green total factor productivity (GTFP) of enterprises were investigated. This study conducted heterogeneity analysis integrating regional, industry, and enterprise dimensions, fully considered the potential endogeneity issues, and conducted multiple robustness tests by exploring alternative approaches, replacing the measures of indicators, and reducing the research sample. The results demonstrated that higher ESG ratings significantly improved the green innovation and GTFP of enterprises. This improvement was achieved through the stakeholders and signaling mechanisms, and was more prominent in economically underdeveloped regions, patent-intensive industries, and industries with lower environmental risk. In addition, the impact varied among enterprises with different property rights. The findings elucidate the pathways through which soft regulation influences micro-level corporate decision-making, making significant contributions to the literature. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical foundation and policy reference for constructing a positive feedback loop mechanism for ESG ratings and promoting the green transformation and upgrading of enterprises. © 2024 The Authors","Environment friendly; ESG ratings; Green innovation; Green transformation","","D.

By adopting a qualitative research approach through semi-structured anonymous interviews with 14 senior managers of six European listed companies we use a framework by assessing the mechanisms of reactivity on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19. By interpreting the practitioners’ points of view through the lens of the sociological framework by Espeland and Sauder (Am J Sociol 113:1–40, 2007) our findings show different mechanisms of reactivity by companies on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19, i.e., active and passive conformity and active resistance. We also identified the main Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) institutional factors that affect managers’ reactivity. An extensive re-formulation of the ESG metrics is required in the light of times of crisis, given that accountability and transparency are strongly linked to quantitative measures which can play a critical role in the financial system and investors’ engagement. Particularly, the strict distinction between “E”, “S” and “G” issues should be abandoned claiming a different holistic re-design of sustainability measures by considering the increasing relevance of the Social dimension in time of COVID-19.

Based on secondary data obtained from Refinitiv, Fame and FTSE 150 databases, the sample consists of 112 non-financial companies from 2010 to 2018, thus 926 firm-year observations. The results reveal a positive and significant relationship between organisational factors including firm size, profitability and firm age across combined ESG and environmental scores. As for the sustainability committee characteristics, there is a positive association between frequency of committee meeting and age diversity with governance scores and a negative relationship between frequency of committee meeting and environmental performance. The empirical finding shows positive and negative relationships under the presence of focussed and non-focussed committees equally. Furthermore, the presence of focussed or non-focussed sustainability committees (SCs) do appear to have an association with the overall CSP. Furthermore, this paper provides empirical evidence of the insignificant relationship of SCC with the sub-dimension of social performance, which contradicts our hypothesis and existing studies. Together with SCC's weak associations with environment and governance dimensions, this finding supports the argument that firms are actively using sustainability committees to create positive public image and reputation to protect legitimacy. © 2023 The Authors.

This study examines the role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside behavioral drivers in shaping consumer intentions toward online fashion renting in China, a model of collaborative consumption that contributes to sustainability by reducing new product demand and promoting the reuse of fashion items. The data was gathered from 403 Chinese customers using a standardized questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the given study hypotheses. The current study empirically demonstrates that customers’ attitudes, past sustainable behavior, and subjective norms are significant indicators of consumers’ intentions toward online fashion renting. The results further indicate that relative advantage, compatibility, perceived ownership, psychological risk, green self-identity, and experience value are the key drivers of consumers’ attitudes toward online fashion renting. Additionally, the ESG factors were found to have a significant positive impact on consumer attitudes toward online fashion renting, underscoring their importance in driving sustainable consumption patterns. By integrating behavioral and ESG perspectives, the study contributes to the growing discourse on how sustainable consumption patterns can be encouraged within the fashion industry, offering theoretical and managerial implications for fostering sustainable behavior.

For the BRICS economies, this paradigm shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity to reimagine their role in the evolving world of responsible investing. Therefore, this study examines the connectedness between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leader indices and the BRICS equity markets using the TVP-VAR model. Our return and volatility connectedness results demonstrate a moderate level of transmission between ESG and conventional equity markets. Moreover, the system integration increased substantially during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19, highlighting the strong impact of global events on financial market behavior. ESG (conventional) stocks predominantly emerge as net transmitters (recipients) of return and volatility shock to the system. The dynamic analysis reveals a notable increase in system connectedness, exhibiting increased transmission during an uncertain market environment. Our portfolio analysis suggests that investors should increase their investment in BRICS equity markets during COVID-19 to get higher diversification benefit, however hedging ESG with conventional stocks becomes expensive (higher hedge ratio) during a turbulent period. These results have substantial implications for portfolio management, suggesting that ESG can effectively mitigate risk and optimize portfolio performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","BRICS; Connectedness; COVID-19; ESG; Portfolio diversification","","S.

Our study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on firms' financial performance and the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in this relationship. Based on a large international panel dataset that includes nine countries from G20 extracted from the Thomson Reuters EIKON database for the period from 2016 to 2021, a set of statistical analyses was applied, including descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, fixed effect regression, and robust regression using GMM model. The findings indicate that the pandemic negatively affected financial performance significantly, while the performance of ESG limits this effect. Thus, companies engaged in ESG activities are the least affected during the pandemic. Fulfilling stakeholders' demands enhances companies' performance during crises and corporate directors' resort to maintaining the performance of ESG as one of the effective strategies during the crisis to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on financial performance. This study shows that compliance with ESG issues can mitigate negative financial impacts during crises and that while implementing ESG practices is costly, it satisfies stakeholders and generates financial gains for companies.

We also examine the role of sustainability committees in explaining stock liquidity. Using companies included in the S&P ASX 300 from 2009 to 2018, a positive association is found between stock liquidity and a strategic motivation for environmental and social engagement and sustainability committee presence. An unexpected finding is that sustainability committee formation can mislead investors to reward a greenwashing motivation by improving stock liquidity.

However, implementation of these practices presents several ethical challenges. This study aims to quantify the influence of organizational capabilities (information technology capabilities and organizational virtues) on start-ups' competitive advantage and readiness to implement environmental, social and governance practices. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey design, and data were collected from 320 start-up founders and/or managers in India. The data were analyzed using Smart PLS 4.0. Findings: The findings suggest that organizational capabilities, including information technology capabilities and organizational virtues, play an important role in enhancing start-ups' competitive advantage and readiness to implement sustainable practices. Dynamic capability mediates these relationships, while entrepreneurial orientation moderates the relationship between organizational virtues and dynamic capability. Practical implications: This study has significant implications for organizations implementing sustainable business practices through the development and nurturance of organizational virtues and information technology capabilities. The study is also useful for leaders, managers and entrepreneurs in training and development, managing tradeoffs and maintaining important organizational capabilities to establish a balance between people’s concerns, the environment and profits.

We account for the potential bidirectionality of the relationships, control for the dynamic nature of the sustainability process, and address the endogeneity problem to appropriately analyze the sustainability process. We estimated a panel data from 734 U.S. companies from 2004 through 2016 by using the system generalized method of moments and find evidence of a clear dynamic nature of the businesses’ sustainability process. The results show that the current levels of the four sustainable development indicators are strongly determined by the levels of these indicators in the two previous years. Our results also show that corporate sustainable development follows a virtuous circle. The relationships across the economic, environmental, and social indicators are bidirectional and positive. Hence, these three sustainability indicators do not compete for available resources. On the contrary, they are tightly interconnected in a firm’s sustainable development processes. Therefore, practitioners and regulators should consider these indicators simultaneously to promote sustainability in businesses and apply long-term sustainability policies.

Moreover, as a potent driving force behind the evolution of energy companies, green innovation has the potential to be supported by advanced technologies such as AI. However, academic research exploring the association between the AI adoption rate and green innovation in energy companies is scarce. This study analyzes data on Chinese listed energy companies from 2010 to 2020. Our findings indicate that energy companies with extensive AI adoption exhibit higher green innovation efficiency. This finding is particularly pronounced among firms that report substantial participation in environmental, social, and governance activities. However, our findings reveal that executives who focus on short-term benefits can undermine the positive influence of AI adoption on green innovation. These main findings are notably significant for energy companies where the roles of chief executive officer and board director are unified, state-owned enterprises, and companies that do not hold bank shares. This study offers novel insights and valuable guidance for policymakers regarding the strategic development of energy companies, thereby bridging a significant gap in the literature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Energy company; Green innovation efficiency; Textual analysis","China; Academic research; Advanced technology; Artificial intelligence technologies; Corporates; Driving forces; Energy companies; Green innovation efficiency; Green innovations; Innovation efficiency; Textual-analysis; artificial intelligence; corporate strategy; efficiency measurement; energy market; innovation; participatory approach; technology adoption; Artificial intelligence","X.

The research conclusions are as follows. (1) National ESG performance improvement significantly promotes green innovation. (2) The improvement of environmental performance and governance performance significantly promotes green innovation, but in countries with weak green innovation capabilities, the improvement of social performance reduces the output of green innovation. (3) The role of national ESG performance in promoting green innovation is stronger in countries with weak green innovation capabilities. (4) In non-high-income countries, the stronger the green innovation capability is, the more obvious is the promotion of ESG performance to green innovation.

We present empirical evidence of a significant positive correlation between ESG performance and HQD, enriching the landscape of sustainable business practices. Importantly, this study introduces technological innovation as a pivotal mediator in this association, shedding light on its critical role in translating ESG endeavors into superior outcomes. The theoretical implications of this research are twofold. Firstly, it solidifies the empirical basis for the positive impact of ESG performance on HQD, advancing our understanding of this critical relationship. Also, by identifying technological innovation as a mediator, this study offers a novel perspective, revealing the intricate mechanisms through which ESG practices shape high-quality corporate development. This discovery expands theoretical frameworks in sustainability and innovation management, enabling a deeper understanding of these dynamics. From a managerial perspective, this study underscores the strategic importance of integrating ESG initiatives into core business strategies. Aligning mission statements, corporate governance, and daily operations with ESG principles enhances reputation and stakeholder engagement and drives high-quality development through responsible decision-making. Moreover, transparency in ESG reporting, using frameworks like GRI and SASB, fosters trust and accountability, promoting sustainable growth. Our research also emphasizes the necessity of technology investment to facilitate high-quality development. Organizations should prioritize innovation, research, and development, as technology streamlines production, differentiates products, and reduces costs, ultimately enhancing overall performance. In terms of policy recommendations, we urge policymakers to incentivize ESG practices and technology innovation through regulations, tax incentives, and support for collaborative ecosystems. These initiatives can align economic development with sustainability goals, creating a conducive environment for responsible business practices and innovation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","ESG performance; High-quality corporate development; Moderated mediation effect; Ownership structure; Technological innovation","","D.

However, the causal pathways connecting SDS to internal capabilities, such as performance measurement systems (PMS) and human resource management (HRM) practices, and their subsequent impact on both ESG performance (ESGP) and financial performance (FP) remain underexplored. This study integrates the sustainable balanced scorecard (SBSC) framework and resource orchestration theory (ROT) to examine how PMS control types (i.e., diagnostic and interactive), PMS justice (PMSJ), and psychological empowerment (PE) mediate the relationships between SDS, ESGP, and FP. Using data from China's top 500 manufacturing firms, we find that SDS positively impacts FP by enhancing ESGP. Furthermore, PMS control types, PMSJ, and PE act as sequential mediators, clarifying the internal mechanisms linking SDS to sustainable performance. These findings suggest that strategic attention to both PMS types and employee empowerment is crucial for achieving ESG as well as financial goals. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ESG strategy; justice; performance measurement systems; psychological empowerment; sustainability performance","","T.

Institutional investors take these into account for decision-making purposes, since these factors are known to affect public opinion and thereby the stock indices of companies. Though sustainability score is usually derived from information available in self-published reports, News articles published by regulatory agencies and social media posts also contain critical information that may affect the image of a company. Language technologies have a critical role to play in the analytics process. In this paper, we present an event detection model for detecting sustainability-related incidents and violations from reports published by various monitoring and regulatory agencies. The proposed model uses a multi-Tasking sequence labeling architecture that works with transformer-based document embeddings. We have created a large annotated corpus containing relevant articles published over three years (2015-2018) for training and evaluating the model. Knowledge about sustainability practices and reporting incidents using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards have been used for the above task. The proposed event detection model achieves high accuracy in detecting sustainability incidents and violations reported about an organization, as measured using cross-validation techniques. The model is thereafter applied to articles published from 2019 to 2022, and insights obtained through aggregated analysis of incidents identified from them are also presented in the paper. The proposed model is envisaged to play a significant role in sustainability monitoring by detecting organizational violations as soon as they are reported by regulatory agencies and thereby supplement the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores issued by third-party agencies.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Classification; ESG; Safety Incident; Sustainability; Violation","","T.

In the digital age, an attempt is also often made to incorporate digital transformation into ESGM. However, research on the combination of digital leadership, ESGM, and organizational innovation is still in its early stages. Therefore, in this study, a research model was constructed by combining ESGM and organizational innovation (OI) from the perspective of digital leadership (DL). Specifically, for achieving organizational sustainability (OS), the mediating effect of two variables—ESGM and organizational innovation—was also explored, and empirical analysis was conducted on Korean and Chinese companies. We took into consideration the premise that the impact of digital leadership, ESGM, and organizational innovation on organizational sustainability could be different due to the differences in the cultures and systems of the two countries. For empirical analysis, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used. The results showed that digital leadership in both countries had a significant effect on ESGM and organizational innovation. Specifically, both digital leadership and ESGM together with organizational innovation played an important role in organizational sustainability in the entire model. However, between digital leadership and organizational sustainability, the mediating effect of ESGM and organizational innovation was different, viz., Korea had partial mediating effects and China had complete mediating effects. It is expected that this study would fill the research gap in the area of digital leadership in ESGM and contribute to the implementation of corporate ESGM strategies and organizational innovation. Furthermore, valuable implications for organizational sustainability and the sustainable growth of companies are also presented. © 2022 by the authors.","digital leadership; ESG management (ESGM); Korea and China; organizational innovation; organizational sustainability","China; Korea; innovation; leadership; management practice; sustainability","J.S.

Based on data collected from 36 airlines worldwide for the period 2008–2019, we found that ESG is negatively and significantly influenced by FP. This result implies that the willingness of airlines to contribute to ESG initiatives is diminished when economic conditions are favorable. State-ownership moderates the relationship between FP and ESG such that the negative relationship is weaker in presence of state shares. Our findings help to disentangle the roles of FP in its contribution to sustainability and are valuable in better understanding the topic in airline context.

The study discerns that positive media coverage significantly contributes to an enhanced ESG performance among heavy-polluting enterprises, particularly those in eastern and western China and those entrenched within highly competitive industries. Positive media coverage predominantly amplifies these enterprises’ environmental and social performance dimensions, while intriguingly, negative media coverage unexpectedly positively impacts their environmental performance. Green total factor productivity and green innovation emerge as crucial facilitators in bolstering the relationship between positive media coverage and the ESG performance of these enterprises.

The effectiveness of ESG practices in achieving corporate sustainability is widely discussed, but the specific impact of fintech development on ESG performance in the Southeast Asia region remains unexplored. To determine the relationship between variables, we employed a fixed effects model. The research findings indicate that firms operating in highly developed fintech cities tend to exhibit better ESG performance. After model treatment through utilizing Generalized Least Square for treatment of heteroskedasticity and cross section dependence, the results further emphasize that firms that are located in a high-level of fintech development cities with high level of capitalization demonstrate stronger ESG performance. However, other elements such as growth, leverage, profitability and cashflow do not seem to have an effect on ESG performance based on the results of the model. These factors contribute to the overall effectiveness of corporate sustainability initiatives. Additionally, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the influence of fintech development on ESG performance is consistent across both large and small firms operating in high-tech industries. In other words, this emphasizes fintech development’s role in promoting sustainable social and economic development, regardless of size or industry. These findings offer new insights into the significance of fintech development in driving sustainable practices and advancing social and economic progress. By understanding the interplay between fintech and ESG performance, policymakers and businesses can make informed decisions to foster sustainable development in Southeast Asia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","ESG performance; Financial constraints; Fintech; Fintech development","","A.T.X.

The study examines the moderating effects of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on the abovementioned relationships by applying a value-based adoption model. An online survey was conducted with consumers who used a food-delivery-service platform, totaling 754 participants. The SPSS 27 statistical package and SmartPLS 4.0 were used to test the research hypotheses, as well as to verify the moderating effects. The results indicate that product quality and specialization have positive effects on perceived value; however, delivery convenience does not. The analysis also found that perceived risk factors associated with delivery-service platforms, specifically, delivery risk, delivery security, and product heterogeneity, have positive effects on perceived value. These results imply that perceived value is linked to consumer perceptions of perceived benefits or risks and is closely related to the formation of customer–brand relationships with delivery platform companies. In addition, it was found that consumer–brand relationships formed in this way act as a decisive factor in the formation of corporate brand loyalty. ESG activity was found to play an important role in moderating the relationship between product quality and specialization, which are factors regarding perceived benefits and value. The ESG performance of delivery-service platforms plays a moderating role in the relationship between perceived value, consumer–brand relationships, and brand loyalty.

The authors propose a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee as a moderating variable in this relationship, drawing on resource dependence and legitimacy theories. This study is crucial in understanding the dynamics of gender diversity and its impact on ESG performance in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of Islamic and conventional banks from 10 Middle Eastern and North African countries during 2008–2022. Initial analysis was conducted using fixed effects panel regression, whereas the robustness test used the generalized method of movement dynamic system. Findings: The findings, which are significant for both conventional and Islamic banks, indicate that female directors are crucial in promoting ESG performance in conventional banks. In contrast, female executives do not appear to contribute significantly. However, for Islamic banks, neither board nor executive gender diversity significantly affects ESG performance. Moreover, the find that the positive moderating role of the CSR committee is significant only for the nexus between board gender diversity and conventional banks’ ESG performance and for the connection between executive gender diversity and Islamic banks’ ESG performance. Originality/value: Despite the widespread belief that gender diversity in top management teams is pivotal in promoting ESG performance, empirical studies supporting these claims are scarce, particularly in the banking sector. The study, therefore, brings a novel perspective to this discourse. These findings have the potential to significantly assist stakeholders in evaluating how gender diversity in top management teams influences banks’ sustainability practices, thereby empowering them to make more informed and impactful investment decisions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Diversity; ESG; Gender; MENA region; Top management","","M.R.

Clarifying the driving factors of consumers’ sharing willingness regarding sustainable image from the perspective of psychology can help fashion brands implement sustainable management and deepen industrial sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Based on commitment theory, this paper proposes a conceptual model that includes three antecedents: perception of greenwashing, environmental, social and governance (ESG) and social media content quality. These affect consumers’ sharing willingness regarding sustainable image through affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. Furthermore, 310 participants reported their tendencies in a formal empirical study. Findings: The results show that unlike green perception, which has a significant negative effect, consumers have a significant positive commitment to high perceived levels of ESG and social media content quality. Besides, all three dimensions under the commitment theory play a partial mediating role between consumer perception and sharing willingness. Originality/value: This study not only extends the research on the commitment theory to the field of fashion marketing and management but also enriches the research context of brand image sharing willingness, which explains the differential effects of different consumer commitments on their information sharing willingness. Moreover, several management implications applicable to the fashion industry have also been proposed based on the conclusion. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Consumer behavior; Empirical research; Sharing willingness; Sustainable fashion","","M.

This study examines the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings provided by SynTao Green Finance on the GTI of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2007 to 2022. By utilizing the time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) model and examining the promotion effect of GTI in application and authorization, the study demonstrates a positive relationship between higher ESG ratings and enterprises’ GTI. This conclusion is substantiated through rigorous robustness tests. The findings indicate that ESG ratings facilitate enterprises’ GTI by addressing financing constraints, mitigating agency issues, and fostering research and development investment. Moreover, ESG ratings are found to be beneficial for enterprises operating in highly competitive markets and garnering significant analytical attention, while not being conducive to GTI in heavily polluting or manufacturing enterprises. By overcoming the limitations of the traditional Ordinary Least Square model in dealing with time trends and persistence effects, this study elucidates the influencing factors of ESG ratings on enterprises’ GTI. Consequently, it provides valuable insights for enterprises to develop targeted sustainable strategies and achieve a mutually beneficial outcome for the economy and the environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","ESG ratings; Green development; Green technology innovation; Sustainability","","L.

Our primary objective is to examine the manner in which the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors influences the relationship between firm performance and EUI. This objective was accomplished by employing a comprehensive dataset that encompassed 50 nations, and spanned eight years (2014–2021). The results reveal that EUI has a detrimental effect on the performance of firms, as the uncertainties induced by EUI foster a culture of risk aversion, which in turn causes firms to postpone their investment in long-term projects. In contrast, the analysis emphasises a positive correlation between ESG and EUI-firm performance relationship, suggesting that firms with robust ESG performance are more likely to invest due to improved reputation, cost reduction, and sustainable market access even in times of energy related uncertainty such as oil price volatility and other energy price surges. The novelty of this research lies in its holistic approach to examining the interconnected dynamics between EUI and firm performance, and the moderating influence of ESG.

Due to presence of negative data, two Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and second stage analyses have been applied. The first is a regression model, which examines the impact of control variables on the efficiency of DEA scores. The second is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, mapping efficiency based on gender diversity. Results indicate that the performance of M&A deals is positively affected by both gender diversity and relative size whereas is negatively affected by the deal value.

Data were collected and analyzed from 69 M&A announcements from January 2010 to June 2023, sourced from the Bloomberg database. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between the post-merger market value of acquiring firms and their ESG performance, indicating that an improvement in ESG factors is associated with increased market value after mergers. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between acquiring companies’ post-merger ESG performance and their target firms’ pre-merger ESG performance. This finding suggests that when acquiring a target firm with high ESG performance, the acquirer is likely to experience an improvement in its own post-merger ESG performance. Moreover, both the post-merger market value and ESG performance of the acquirer are likely to improve with the profitability and size of firms but will have a negative impact based on the leverage components of the acquiring firms. © Manoj Panda, Pankaj Sharma, Vasa Laszlo, Manohar Kapse, Vinod Sharma, Yogesh Mahajan, 2024.","and governance performance; environmental; market value; mergers and acquisitions; social; socially responsible investment","","","English","Investm.

Second, we employ the extended TOPSIS with the quantum spherical fuzzy sets to rank the industry alternatives concerning their directional ESG performances. The findings show that (i) H20 Emissions, Innovation, Community Investment, Gender Equity, Human Rights, and CSR Strategy are the main influencing factors based on their impact-relations directional scores, (ii) Resource Usage, Product Responsibility, and Shareholders’ Rights are the set of criteria under the influence of remaining ESG, (iii) Innovation is the strongest ESG performance criterion, whereas Human Rights is the weakest, (iv) technology and communication are the best-performing industries based on the directional ESG index performance scores, whereas real estate and basic materials industries are the worst performing.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines ESG and OR through a 3x3 conceptual matrix, where ESG factors are listed along the vertical axis and OR components along the horizontal axis. This results in nine quadrants, which have been read according to two arrangements: (1) static, looking at the specific characteristics of each single quadrant, and (2) dynamic, investigating the relationships between the different quadrants according to the system theory (ST) lens. Findings: The integration between ESG and OR results in nine organisational typologies, each characterised by a specific focus: (1) green visioning, (2) eco ethos, (3) climate guard, (4) inclusive strategy, (5) empathy ethos, (6) community shield, (7) ethical blueprint, (8) integrity ethos and (9) compliance guard. These typologies and related focuses determine the different strategic options of organisations, the decision-making emphasis concerning ESG factors and OR components and the organisation’s behaviour concerning its internal and external environment. According to ST, the nine typologies interact with each other, emphasising the existence of interconnectedness, interdependence and cascading effects between ESG and OR. Originality/value: The paper represents a unique attempt to interrelate ESG factors and OR components according to a ST lens, emphasising the dynamic nature of their interactions and organisations’ need for continuous adaptation and learning to make decisions that create sustainable long-term value. © 2024, Luna Leoni.","Decision-making; ESG; Matrix; Organisational resilience; Sustainability; System theory","","L.

Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical lenses underpinning this study are rooted in stakeholder theory and resource-based theory. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of financial and non-financial firms selected from FTSE ALL-listed companies over the period (2012–2022). Findings: Findings of this study reveal that ESG score has a statistically significant impact on both financial and non-financial firms. An increase in firm ESG performance significantly increases the likelihood of M&A. The results reveal that the impact of ESG on firm financial performance is negative and significant, but this is not the case for non-financial firms where the impact despite being positive is insignificant. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted using data from firms within the UK context. Future research may adopt or adapt the research questions in different context and settings. Future studies may adopt a case study approach or survey-based questionnaires or employ various theoretical lenses. Practical implications: Findings of this study have managerial and theoretical implications. Integrating ESG into operational and strategic organisational activities enhances attractiveness to potential bidders and contributes to sustainable financial performance because acquiring targets with high ESG performance can have a positive effect on the acquirer’s post-merger market value, thereby strongly confirming the use of ESG as a value-enhancing strategy to promote corporate external growth. Originality/value: Our findings add to the extant literature, a recent empirical evidence that, to the best of our knowledge, our this study is among the first to examine the influence of ESG on M&A and firm performance through comparison between the financial and non-financial sectors. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental social and governance (ESG) performance; Financial performance; Mergers and acquisitions (M&As); UK companies","","F.

However, corporate ESG performance cannot be achieved without the support of financial development and the underlying mechanisms through which fintech development affects corporate ESG performance in emerging markets remain unexplored. Firms that are less financially constrained exhibit higher ESG performance in cities with better developed fintech. Moreover, the results remain robust after addressing the endogeneity between fintech development and ESG performance and using different city-level fintech indexes. Additionally, the results remain robust after addressing the endogeneity between fintech development and ESG performance and using different model specifications and variable measurement. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the effect of fintech development on ESG performance is stronger for firms that are small, operate in technology industries, and have financial executives. These findings provide new insights into the role of fintech development in promoting sustainable social and economic development. © 2022 by the authors.","ESG performance; financial constraints; fintech","corporate strategy; economic development; industrial performance; market system; sustainability; technological development","Y.

Sustainable practices are a growing phenomenon around the world and there is increasing research on the correlation between Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and corporate financial performance (FP). In parallel with the increasing focus on ESG, digitalization has gained a pivotal role in the business environment. The paper wants to investigate the relationship between ESG factors and financial performance. Moreover, it tries to understand how digitalization influences that relationship. We use panel data regression using pooled ordinary least squares, fixed effects or least squares dummy variables. The panel covered by our study consists of a sample of listed companies belonging to the Energy and Utilities sectors observed from the year 2019 to 2021. In particular, our data set includes financial indicators closely related to the corporate profitability, sustainability indicators and an indicator use as a proxy of digitalization. The results provide interesting insights on how digitalization can moderate the relationship between ESG and profitability goals within the business environment, and especially the correlation that exists between sustainability and profit. The results suggest that ESG integration in corporate organizations positively affects FP because a strong ESG proposition enables businesses to grow both in existing and new markets. The findings further support the need to invest in digitalization since they show a substantial gain in financial efficiency, which can eventually boost corporate revenues. The research results support the minimization of the corporate social cost and, more generally, of social well-being. We contribute to the literature by studying the moderating role of investments in digital technologies in the context of sustainability, to understand whether or not digitalization can accelerate the impact of ESG on corporate profitability. © 2025 Morea et al.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the current status of ESG standards, particularly in the context of China, remains a scientific gap. This study bridges this gap by adopting a bibliometric analysis to comprehensively analyze the current status of ESG standards. Based on an analysis of 213 articles involving ESG standards in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2015 to 2024, this study identified the global distribution of ESG standards organizations, research hotspots, trends, and cutting-edge status of ESG standards research. It was found that the research on ESG standards shows a growing trend: the research hotspots mainly focus on the areas of performance, rating, investment, and sustainability. Crucially, this study offers novel insights into the current development status of ESG standards in China, emphasizing the significant roles of the government’s promotion of ESG standard formulation and regulation, corporate voluntary compliance, and academic research and communication. Future research directions on ESG standards are proposed and imply that the implementation of ESG standards in China should be beneficial to sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace; ESG; ESG disclosure; ESG standards","China; academic research; bibliography; corporate social responsibility; development level; industrial regulation; software; sustainable development","H.

More specifically, we study the impact of occupied outside directors, outside directors sitting on several boards of directors, on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of the company. We collect information about board characteristics, information about the board and management from MSCI ESG Research and financial information from Compustat. The study collects data based on panel data, which ranges from 2014 to 2020. The final sample consists of 550 US companies over a five-year period and contains 3850 firm-year observations. The study finds a positive relationship between busy outside directors and ESG performance. Busy outside directors have a positive impact not only on the overall ESG score, but also on individual ESG components. The environmental score is most affected by busy external directors, while the governance score appears to be little affected. Contrary to the theory that busy outside directors are overly engaged and degrade the fixed value, the findings support the theory that busy outside directors improve a company's sustainability performance because of their engagement, experience and the ESG performance. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Board of directors; Busy directors; ESG performance","","A.

Although previous studies have explored their relationship, a comprehensive systematic review on this topic is still lacking. We conducted a detailed literature search in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and identified 73 papers published between 2016 and 2023 as the sample, covering annual trends, country and industry distribution, theoretical frameworks, proxy variables, research methods, research results, and provided direction for future research. We found a significant increase in the number of studies over the past 3 years. Cross-country studies dominated the field, with most research adopting multi-industry analysis, while studies focusing on a single industry were relatively rare. The stakeholder theory and agency theory were the most widely applied theories. Most studies showed that ESG performance had a positive effect on firm value, reflecting the growing importance that markets and investors placed on ESG performance and its contribution to long-term firm growth. However, some studies reported negative or insignificant effects, noting that the effects of ESG performance varied by industry, region, and market environment. This study suggests that future research should explore the independent and interactive effects of each ESG dimension on firm value, focusing on dynamic relationships across industries and regions, using new methods and models, and incorporating moderating variables. This study provides practical guidance for firm managers and policymakers to optimize ESG practices, enhancing firm value and promoting sustainability. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","agency theory; corporate social responsibility; ESG performance; financial performance; firm value; stakeholder theory; sustainability; sustainable development","","X.

Corporate social responsibility performance is measured with a composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) score and with its three sub-dimensions between 2011 and 2018. Fixed Effects regression analysis was run to test the hypotheses, and subsequently, Ordinary Least Squares regression was run to test the robustness of the results. The results suggest that board gender diversity is positively associated with overall corporate social responsibility performance and governance performance. Moreover, the firms which have a sustainability committee are more likely to have greater corporate social responsibility performance (both overall and social) than those do not. Furthermore, firms with diffused ownership structures are more likely to show greater performance in the Social Pillar of corporate social responsibility. Board independence has a weak association with only governance performance. Contrary to expectations, the results regarding the value-relevance of corporate social responsibility performance did not produce significant positive outcomes. These findings confirm that women on boards and corporate social responsibility committees are an essential factor to achieve corporate social responsibility goals. However, the insignificant relationship between board characteristics and the Environmental Pillar of corporate social responsibility performance is quite surprising, and the discovery sparks various queries. Finally, logistics firms need to reconsider the competency or role of independent directors in corporate social responsibility issues as currently they are weakly influential. © 2020","Board characteristics; Corporate social responsibility; Drivers; Firm value; Logistics sector","Regression analysis; Board characteristics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Gender diversity; Independent directors; Logistics firm; Ordinary least squares regressions; Ownership structure; Value relevances; Sustainable development","K.

However, the elusive social aspect of sustainability and its influence on successful business has been under-investigated in corporate culture literature so far. The aim of this paper is to examine whether a correlation can be found between corporate social sustainability culture (expressed as explicit “items” of corporate values and practices emphasizing employee and societal well-being) and the financial success of a company. This is examined through a multiple regression analysis of two contrasting European polls, examining items indicating corporate social sustainability culture, and financial outcomes. The empirical results show that four specific success-related social sustainability dimensions of corporate culture are predictors of a company being classified as financially successful. These are: Sustainability strategy and leadership; Mission, communication and learning; Social care and work life; and Loyalty and identification. The paper contributes to the understanding of how to manage corporate social sustainability culture whilst supporting companies’ financial performance, and provides evidence-grounded recommendations to business managers and stakeholders aiming to manage social sustainability proactively by undertaking cultural change and development initiatives. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Corporate culture; Corporate sustainability; Financial performance; Social sustainability; Success factors; Sustainability","","C.

With the growing awareness of environmental protection and the promotion of international cooperation mechanisms, there is a global consensus to control greenhouse gases. In order to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate change, there is an urgent need for more companies to take action and make credible commitments to combat climate change and carbon reduction goals aligned with the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As one of the largest and most influential international food and beverage companies with a range of well-known brands, PepsiCo has made ambitious commitments to science-based climate goals, including reducing GHG emissions from its direct operations by 75% against the 2015 baseline and reducing GHG emissions across its indirect value chain by 40% by 2030, as well as setting an ambitious new target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. PepsiCo has incorporated carbon reduction and climate strategies in all focus areas across its value chain, accelerating its work on broadening the scale of sustainable agriculture and regenerative farming practice; reducing plastic use and increasing the use of recycle and renewable materials as well as adopting low-carbon alternatives; developing efficient and alterna-tive solutions in transportation and distribution; shifting to renewable electricity and fuels in man-ufacturing and fleet. Up to 2021, PepsiCo has achieved a 23% of the absolute emissions target of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and 7.9% of the absolute emissions target of reducing Scope 3 emissions. This research aims to evaluate the performance of PepsiCo on achieving their carbon reduction targets based on the analysis of the reported carbon estimates and reduction strategies, and also provides future strategic suggestions and guidance by adopting case study analysis. Alt-hough PepsiCo has reported great progress in reducing carbon emissions, further efforts are needed to achieve these goals. © 2022 by the authors.

Using a dynamic network slack-based measure (DNSBM), we assess FP through a two-stage process: innovation efficiency (IE) and profitability efficiency (PE). We explore how CSR or the three pillars of sustainable investing–environmental (EPS), social (SPS), and governance (GPS)–individually influence overall FP (IE and PE). The study reveals that IE consistently outperforms PE during this period. EPS negatively impacts overall FP, while SPS is negatively associated with PE. Additionally, firms in countries with higher individualism tend to strengthen the negative relationship between EPS and IE, and between GPS and overall FP. Conversely, firms in nations with higher long-term orientation often weaken the negative relationship between GPS and overall FP. These findings underscore the importance of cultural factors in both CSR and FP. They suggest that multinational firms should tailor their CSR strategies to cultural contexts to enhance overall firm performance and recommend that governments play a role in facilitating CSR initiatives that align with cultural values. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CSR; DNSBM; electronics industry; firm performance; individualism; innovation efficiency; long-term orientation; profitability efficiency","","T.-T.

In view of the overwhelming breakthrough of machine learning in prediction, this paper proposes SRI portfolio construction models by combining a double-screening mechanism considering machine learning prediction and an extended global minimum variance (GMV) model (or extended maximum Sharpe ratio (MSPR) model), which are, respectively, named double-screening socially responsible investment (DSSRI) portfolio models I and II. The proposed models consist of two stages, i.e., stock screening and asset allocation. First, this paper develops a novel double-screening mechanism incorporating environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) and return potential criteria to ensure that high-quality stocks with good ESG performance and high-return potential are input into the optimal portfolio. Specifically, to obtain accurate stock return predictions, an extreme learning machine model optimized by the genetic algorithm is employed to predict stock prices. Next, to trade off the financial and ESG objectives of SRI investors, an extended GMV model (or extended MSPR model) considering the ESG factor is introduced to determine the capital allocation proportion of the stocks. We take the A-share market of China as the sample to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The empirical results demonstrate that compared with alternative models, the proposed models can yield better annualized return and ESG score performance as well as competitive Sharpe ratio performance.  © 2021 Jun Zhang and Xuedong Chen.","","","X.

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Business versus Ethics? (inspired by the title of the commentary by Jeffrey Harrison). The authors of these commentaries seek to transcend the age-old separation fallacy (Freeman in Bus Ethics Q 4(4):409–421, 1994) that juxtaposes business and ethics/society, posing a forced choice or trade off. Providing a contemporary take on the classical question “if it’s legal is it ethical?”, David Hess explores the role of the law in promoting or hindering stakeholder-oriented purpose and governance structure. Jeffrey Harrison encourages scholars to move beyond the presupposition that businesses are either strategic or ethical and explore important questions at the intersection of strategy and ethics. The proposition that business models might be inherently ethical or inherently unethical in their design is developed by Sheila Killian, who examines business systems, their morality, and who they serve. However, the conundrum that entrepreneurs are either lauded for their self-belief and risk-taking, or loathed for their self-belief and risk-taking, is discussed by M. Tina Dacin and Julia Roloff using the metaphor of taboos and totems. These commentaries seek to explore positions that advocate multiplicity and tensions in which business ethics is not either/or but both. © 2022, The Author(s).","Corporate purpose; Culture; Future of business ethics; Human rights; Social enterprise; Stakeholders; Strategy; Unethical business models","","M.T.

This study selects a sample of Chinese A-share-listed manufacturing firms from Shanghai and Shenzhen, spanning the years 2012 to 2022, and constructs a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of ESG performance on the financial flexibility of these firms and its underlying mechanisms. The study finds that: (1) ESG performance significantly enhances corporate financial flexibility. (2) ESG performance promotes financial flexibility primarily through mechanisms such as alleviating financing constraints, improving competitive advantages, and attracting analysts’ attention. (3) Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive effect of ESG performance on financial flexibility is more pronounced in high-tech firms and non-heavily-polluted firms. (4) Sub-dimensional analysis shows that corporate governance has a more significant impact on financial flexibility enhancement than social responsibility, while environmental investment exerts an inhibitory effect on financial flexibility. (5) The uncertainty associated with ESG ratings weakens the contribution of ESG practices to the financial flexibility of manufacturing firms. Based on these findings, this paper suggests that enterprises should be encouraged to actively adopt ESG practices, accelerate the improvement of their ESG disclosure systems, and support firms with strong ESG performance to foster high-quality development. © 2025 by the authors.","analyst attention; Chinese manufacturing industry; competitive advantage; ESG performance; financial flexibility; financing constraints","China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen; competitiveness; corporate social responsibility; economic growth; economic impact; financial provision; industrial performance; manufacturing","X.

However, during the COVID-19 crisis, export-led manufacturing firms around the world, particularly those in developing countries, have been forced to lay off workers and cope with VA-related problems, and serious survival problems have resulted in critical corporate social responsibility (CSR)-related challenges. Whereas limited research has discussed relevant issues in nonwestern contexts, we adopt a global perspective of business model and transactional cost theory, aiming to fill this gap by investigating the mechanisms among different dimensions of CSR implementation, firm performance, and VA herein. Based on a sample of listed Chinese manufacturing firms, the results show that the CSR technique dimension is negatively related to firm performance, that the CSR content dimension is positively related to firm performance, and that VA positively moderates the relationships of all three CSR dimensions to firm performance. The main contribution here is providing a more comprehensive understanding of how different CSR dimensions reflect firms’ multiple ethical behaviors, which influence their sustainable performance, respectively, thus enriching the existing knowledge of CSR studies in a new digital era riddled with uncertainties and complexities. We also offer practical implications for other export-led manufacturing firms in developing countries facing turbulent times. © 2021 by the authors.

Analyzing 1,395 firm-years from 2011 to 2019, we find that the SK group exhibits superior ESG performance relative to other chaebol groups, paritcularly in terms of environmental and governance performance. However, the gap between the two groups declined after the SK group’s declaration of DBL management. Moreover, while better ESG performance leads to lower firm value for th e SK group, th e relation is reversed for oth er ch aebol firms.

Findings: The results show that Board Independence, Meeting Attendance by Board Members, Board Gender Diversity and Board Skills on Sustainable Manufacturing are positively associated with ZDM Practice, while Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Duality of Power has a negative impact. In the millennium development goals period, the foremost drivers of ZDM Practice are Board Independence, Board Gender Diversity and Board Skills on Sustainable Manufacturing, while this shifted to Board Independence and Board Gender Diversity in the sustainable development goals period. Originality/value: The study provides empirical evidence that organisations seeking to improve sustainable manufacturing practice may consider strengthening their CG structures to demonstrate responsible manufacturing in line with stakeholders’ expectations and to preserve corporate legitimacy.

Findings reveal that larger ICT firms exhibit lower environmental (E) risks but higher governance (G) risks, with lower governance risks strongly linked to superior financial performance, positioning governance as the most critical ESG factor. Investment portfolios constructed based on ESG risk levels consistently outperformed benchmarks during periods of economic instability, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the resilience of firms with effective ESG management. From an investor's perspective, tailored and valid ESG disclosures are essential for informed decision-making. This study extends the signalling governance theory by identifying low ESG risk—particularly governance risk—as a direct signal of corporate resilience and sustainability.

It explores consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral response to sustainable fashion. The research was conducted using a mixed-method strategy. The quantitative questionnaire examines consumer attitudes towards sustainable fashion, underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behavior. This was supported by a qualitative enquiry using semi-structured interviews to explore consumer knowledge of and attitudes towards sustainable fashion in Spain. Consumer familiarity with sustainable fashion was found to be high and broad in definition scope. Social aspects of sustainability were predominant tangents. A disjuncture between company’s sustainable communication and consumer perception was apparent as well as attitudes and actual purchase intentions towards sustainable fashion. Opportunities to foster further sustainable fashion business practices and communication were identified. The findings highlight that fashion retailers should clearly communicate the meaning of sustainability and their proactive response to sustainability. The development of effective communication strategies that clearly highlights retailer’s compliance with and efforts to becoming more sustainable is a prerequisite arising from the study. This study contributes to burgeoning research on sustainable fashion within mainstream marketing and management literature.

The purpose is to help businesses making strategic decisions to better achieve both business and societal objectives. Revising the concept of Switching Costs and Benefits to focus on organisations’ change effects, we apply multiple case-study analysis to co-create the framework with four participating firms. Firms are purposely selected based on pre-established criteria of financial and sustainability performance. Through a reiterative process, research is untangled in three stages of interactions with participants for a total of six societal objectives and 34 projects. Primary data are collected from heads of departments or sustainability project managers through semi-structured interviews, surveys, and email exchanges between 2018 and 2021. This paper provides theoretical and practical contributions. In particular, this research extends the theoretical discussions about how to reconcile business and societal interests by adopting a new perspective to organisational decisions based on the assessment of change effects.

Companies are gradually adopting behaviors aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which represent a crucial aspect of the 2030 Agenda. In practice, they are currently incorporating organizational strategies that jointly consider environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), with the aim of generating value for all stakeholders. This paper aims to review, through a recognized seven-step procedure, the current literature on the impact that ESG practices have in industry, with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions. The results are extremely useful for both researchers and entrepreneurs. The bibliometric analysis shows that interest in the ESG paradigm has grown considerably in the last three years. Furthermore, through the analysis of 13 key documents, it emerges that (i) the European community is pushing significantly towards the adoption of ESG practices through new regulations, (ii) the link between industrial operations and carbon emissions can no longer be neglected within the factory of the future, and (iii) significant efforts are still needed to standardize, in terms of variables and KPIs, the adoption of ESG-centric strategies. © 2023 by the authors.","analytical approach; carbon emissions; ESG; industry; sustainability","analytical framework; automobile industry; carbon emission; corporate social responsibility; sustainability","V.

Despite the increasing importance of CSR, the literature examining its application and impact in Asia remains both sparse and fragmented. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) of 79 scholarly articles, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to ensure a comprehensive and replicable analysis of CSR practices within Asian corporate entities. The review uncovers key themes related to the integration of CSR into corporate governance structures, including the emphasis on renewable energy, ethical business conduct, employee engagement, and data privacy, while highlighting the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by Asian companies given their unique cultural, social, and regulatory landscapes. The findings indicate that although Asian firms are increasingly incorporating CSR into their strategies, there is a significant need for more robust evaluation frameworks, particularly concerning biodiversity, deforestation, and collaboration with conservation organizations. Looking ahead, the study emphasizes the importance of prioritizing renewable energy as a critical environmental focus across Asia, especially given the region's rapid urbanization and industrial growth. The transition to renewable energy sources is not only vital for mitigating environmental impacts and combating climate change but also presents long-term economic benefits. Additionally, the study identifies a substantial growth in digital adoption across various sectors in Asia, underscoring the need for stronger cybersecurity measures to protect emerging digital infrastructures. Culturally and socially, many Asian countries show a natural inclination towards sustainability, which can be leveraged to foster greater acceptance and integration of renewable energy at the grassroots level. Furthermore, the study advocates for enhanced collaboration within Asia and on a global scale to facilitate knowledge transfer, share best practices, and achieve economies of scale in renewable energy projects. Such joint efforts could accelerate the transition to sustainable energy and help overcome challenges related to technology, finance, and policymaking. These insights are essential for both scholars and practitioners aiming to align CSR practices with global sustainability goals, thereby fostering responsible corporate behaviour across diverse sectors in Asia. © The Author(s) 2024.","Asian economies; Business strategy; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Environmental, social and governance (ESG); Regional adaptation","Asia; alternative energy; corporate social responsibility; deforestation; literature review; sustainability","K.

This performance is measured in five pillars—Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers—but with no minimum threshold per pillar. This allows companies to choose those impact areas where they want to perform well. This study, based on the triple bottom line theory, analyses the environmental performance of 68 UK-based B Corps from two environmentally sensitive sectors: manufacturing and wholesale/retail. We use an inductive approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to find out whether this trade-off-permitting approach leads to high environmental performance in companies and whether the certification successfully prevents greenwashing. Our results show firstly that companies in the two sectors tend to perform better socially than environmentally; secondly, that prioritizing one social impact area generally leads to below-average environmental performances compared to certified peers; and thirdly, that to rule out greenwashing, B Corp should ensure certified companies display high levels of environmental performance and that they align their “green” claims to their performance. © 2021 The Authors.

Yet whether and how digital resources shape corporate social responsibility (CSR) remains unclear. This paper examines the relationship between digital resources, CSR, and environmental performance during a period of rapid technological development, with a focus on Chinese manufacturing enterprises. We draw on structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify how digitalization contributes to more environmentally friendly and sustainable economic development. Our dataset comprises survey data from 174 Chinese manufacturing companies, providing a theoretical basis and empirical support for the deep integration of digitalization with green and low-carbon transformation. The results demonstrate that digital resources significantly promote CSR, which in turn facilitates the improvement of environmental performance. We thus find that CSR plays a mediating role in the digital resources–environmental performance relationship. Consequently, companies can consider greening their innovations through CSR practices as part of the digital transformation environment. Finally, digital resources and CSR contribute to greening innovation in different ways. This study highlights the critical role of robust CSR in driving green performance during digital transformation. It addresses a significant research gap by exploring the synergistic relationship between digitalization and green innovation, emphasizing the strategic importance of integrating CSR to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes for both society and businesses. Additionally, the study identifies deficiencies in existing research regarding the interplay between digital transformation and CSR and investigates how enterprises can directly enhance environmental performance by leveraging digital resources within the context of the digital economy. © 2024 by the authors.","China; CSR; digital capabilities; digital transformation; environmental performance","China; corporate social responsibility; data set; greenspace; industrial policy; innovation; transformation","S.

To do this, sustainability parameters are analysed to verify possible improvement opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and grey relational analysis (GRA) to analyse data from a survey with Brazilian professionals regarding aspects of sustainability in Brazilian manufacturers. The average score levels and the ranking of these aspects are evaluated. Findings: Through the analysis performed, it was possible to verify that manufacturers in Brazil still have a long path to travel in the search for sustainability. Comparatively, it was observed that practices related to local communities received the lowest scores, on average. In contrast, on average, practices related to productivity and efficiency, occupational accidents and diseases, and compliance with environmental legislation received the highest scores. Practical implications: The results presented in this paper show that there are several improvement opportunities to be sought by Brazilian manufacturing companies regarding sustainability aspects. Particular attention should be given to local community practices. Besides companies, policymakers can also use this analysis to guide their future actions, encouraging manufacturing companies to better support the local community. Researchers can use the instrument of analysis (TOPSIS and GRA) to analyse other realities and compare them with the findings presented. Originality/value: The analysis of Brazilian manufacturing companies’ reality regarding sustainability practices and considering a model based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (IBGC) is novel in the literature. The use of TOPSIS and GRA, as well as comparing their findings, generated interesting insights for companies, policymakers and researchers. The analysis presented shows the need for more significant concern for local communities and can be used to support further debates and action plans to minimise this gap. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brazil; Corporate social responsibility; GRA; Sustainable development; Sustainable manufacturing; TOPSIS","","I.S.

In this study, I examine if the rival firm’s sustainability behavior is driven by the focal firm’s behavior. Although a growing number of firms globally have voluntarily adopted and carried out a wide range of sustainability practices, there are firms that are driven by the position taken by industry competitors. Here, I examine such phenomena, to determine if a focal firm’s sustainability behavior is influenced by the rival’s sustainability behavior. In addition, I also examine how the competitive landscape of the focal firm, in the form of the focal firm’s size, the rival’s sustainability reputation, and industry concentration moderates the behavioral influence. I find a positive association between the rival firm’s sustainability performance and the focal firm’s sustainability performance. I also find that the focal firm’s size and industry concentration positively moderate the rivalry.

In this context, the key parameters of Pillar E of the ESG concept were defined, and the impact of each parameter on the perception of the ESG concept was quantified through regression analysis. Empirical research conducted in February 2024 on a sample of 1,320 respondents showed that environmental factors significantly determine the support and application of the ESG concept in enterprises in the V4 countries. Firms that pay attention to environmental factors have a more positive attitude towards ESG than firms that pay less attention to environmental factors. The strongest influence on shaping positive perceptions of ESG is the belief of firms’ management that environmental entrepreneurship brings competitive advantages. Businesses that perceive sustainable business not only as an ethical responsibility but also as a means of gaining a competitive advantage are often more successful in implementing ESG elements into their strategy and business activities. The conviction of company management that the company is managed in accordance with environmental legislation strongly influences their positive attitudes towards ESG. The intense perception of climate change and the application of green tools in corporate management shapes companies’ positive perceptions of the ESG concept. Firms that have demonstrated a responsive approach to addressing climate change by having developed procedures to control GHG emissions, using renewable energy sources, and recycling materials and water clearly show that ESG approaches are firmly embedded in their strategies. © 2024, Vilnius University.

The Heckman two-stage procedure is followed to examine the moderating effects. We find that the average stock market reaction is not significant. Cross-sectional analyses indicate that firms with earlier recognitions, recognized for demonstration projects (compared with pilot ones), and operating in more-polluting industries have greater market reactions, while types of PEPs (internal versus external), export intensity and government ownership (state-owned or not) do not moderate the market reaction.

These programs provide sustainability for the company because they can involve community social relations, economic growth, and increasing environmental awareness. This study aimed to test corporate social responsibility on firm performance with green innovation as a mediation. This study used PROPER companies in 2015–2019, which were chosen using a purposive sampling method involving annual reports and financial reports, yielding 253 companies as a sample. Data were obtained from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and tested using STATA. This study indicates that corporate social responsibility can increase green innovation in companies with the stability of environmentally friendly materials, emission reductions for the surrounding community, and saving energy use. Corporate social responsibility has a positive effect on firm performance because the company has maintained the continuity of the process. After all, it has a harmonious relationship with the community. Furthermore, green innovation positively affects firm performance because the company can reduce energy use and utilize environmentally friendly resources. Therefore, green innovation can mediate the influence of corporate social responsibility and firm performance. This research contributes to senior managers who are part of their company’s top management to understand the critical role of corporate social responsibility in maintaining the company’s sustainability by paying attention to the part of the company’s environment and implementing government regulations.

This quantitative study investigates the relationship between sustainability reporting quality and firm value, focusing on non-financial sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) between 2017 and 2020. The sample size for this study was 320. The analysis employed a multivariate approach using a structural equation model (SEM) based on Partial Least Squares (PLS). The research findings demonstrate that the quality of sustainability reporting can increase firm value because investors view the quality of reporting as reflecting sustainable practices that have been implemented properly. Furthermore, the study confirms that sustainability reporting quality positively influences investor recognition. This research contributes empirically by highlighting the mediating role of investor recognition in the relationship between sustainability reporting quality and firm value. This study provides evidence that investor recognition of sustainability reporting quality contributes to an enhancement in firm value from an agency theory and signaling theory perspective. © 2023 Growing Science Ltd.

While the music industry stands out as a tool to promote cultural diversity and social integration, it is also considered as an important economic sector. The creative industry and creative economy define the transformation of individual creativity into an economic resource and have the potential to increase social welfare and indirectly support environmental sustainability. In the study, which was designed on the axis of case study, one of the qualitative research method designs, the sustainability practices and policies of various actors of the music industry in the last three years within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were analyzed and interpreted through document analysis method. The findings of the study reveal that there are differences in the approaches of the selected music industry companies towards the SDGs. In particular, it was observed that “Decent Work and Economic Growth”, “Gender Equality”, “Climate Action” and “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions” were adopted as priority issues by the analyzed companies. However, goals such as “End Poverty”, “Clean Water and Sanitation” and “End Hunger” are not among the priorities, and companies may need to make more efforts in these areas. In addition, it was found that some companies have taken steps towards social sustainability goals such as “Quality Education” and “Reducing Inequality”. In conclusion, it is emphasized that the music industry is an important player contributing to sustainable development. Sustainability standards for the music industry can be developed. The study aims to contribute to an in-depth understanding of the relationship between sustainability and the music industry as an important element of the creative economy. © 2025, Tolga Karaca.

We collected data from 200 manufacturers to test the proposed relationships. The results showed that value cocreation had different positive impacts on CSR; intracompany value cocreation had the greatest impact, followed by customer and supplier value cocreation. CSR did not have a significant positive effect on economic performance. Companies’ innovation capacities completely mediated the relationship between CSR and economic performance. The findings of the analysis have theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study broadens the research scope on CSR innovation and value cocreation. Practically, it helps companies realize that by sharing information, establishing cooperative relations, and conducting interactions with stakeholders, which can promote the implementation of CSR innovation practices, economic performance can be improved. © 2023 by the authors.","corporate social responsibility (CSR); economic performance; innovation capacity; value cocreation","corporate social responsibility; data set; innovation; research work","Y.

This research endeavours to ascertain a process facilitating the analysis and seamless integration of sustainability into corporate strategy. The goal is to establish an “integrated” ESG governance framework adept at effectively managing institutional pressures. Design/methodology/approach: This research employs an action research approach, focusing on a leading company within the sugar industry. The investigation delves into the relationship dynamics associated with business issues through a process that engages, either directly or indirectly, board members, top managers, as well as industrial and commercial customers, along with final consumers. Findings: The formulation of a sustainability strategy serves as a guiding framework for the Board of Directors in effectively navigating tensions arising from environmental, social and economic pressures. Research limitations/implications: The research contributes to bridging the realms of business governance and institutional theory (viewed under a paradoxical lens). On a managerial level, the study introduces a structured process aimed at seamlessly integrating sustainability objectives into governance, aligning with international ESG guidelines (OECD, 2023; WEF, 2020).

In particular, an increasing number of Fintech enterprises have started to launch new services in order to avoid the organizational barriers that impact negatively on the voluntary adoption of sustainable business models by SMEs. However, research is still scarce in systematizing the efforts and identifying the facilitating factors for such a transition. Drawing on a diverse set of companies, case studies linking Fintech application and circular economy (CE) in diverse industries and contexts are analyzed and discussed. The findings of the qualitative analysis suggest that Fintech, an example of sectors developed under the influence of Industry 4.0, can play a relevant role in the transition of SMEs toward a more sustainable business model leading to better integration of circular economy practices.

We examine the effects of governance, environmental and social responsibility performance on the firm, and find moderate support for CSR disclosure increasing firm value. However, only the disclosure of social responsibility scores was associated with higher levels of firm value, as measured by Tobin's q.

This study aims to identify how government regulations affect the optimal determination of labeling choices in a competitive market. Our findings suggest that an industry-set eco-label is optimal in terms of economic benefits for firms that produce green products. However, a self-set eco-label can be a viable option if the credibility of the self-set label is high enough to be comparable to the industry-set label. For social benefits, the government-set eco-label is superior to both industry-set and self-set labels, but it does not benefit the profits of firms or the industry. Consequently, firms will not actively choose government eco-labels without considering other mandatory measures. Our results also suggest that eco-label credibility and subsidies can improve both economic and social benefits for firms. In addition, an increase in consumer preference is beneficial to social benefits, but not to economic benefits for firms. Furthermore, environmental taxes can improve economic benefits for green firms, but excessive taxes may harm industry performance and social welfare. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for stakeholders in making eco-label decisions. Additionally, by integrating government regulations and voluntary market tools, the study provides important policy implications for enhancing the effectiveness of eco-labels. © 2023 The Authors","Eco-label credibility; Eco-labels; Government regulation; Market competition","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Public policy; Eco-label credibility; Ecolabels; Economic benefits; Environmental information; Environmentally responsible; Government regulation; Market competition; Market instruments; Social benefits; Competition","K.

This paper analyzes the behavior of government, manufacturers and retailers using the evolutionary game theory model. This model was used to test hypotheses about various characteristics of the three players. The main variables selected for this purpose include the probability of adoption of business process innovation, the probability of monitoring, the income manufacturers and retailers can expect from innovation and costs associated with non-compliance with regulations. Furthermore, simulation analysis was conducted to examine equilibrium strategies’ stability. Additionally, a small survey was conducted in Lahore and Islamabad on plastic bag manufacturers and retailers to find empirical support for our research. This study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature on environmental regulations because it highlights the conditions in which a ban on plastic bags can effectively reduce plastic bag usage. Simulation analysis reveals that environmental policies on plastic bags can be more successful if an incentive-based approach is used by governments as strict enforcement leads to high monitoring costs which is not feasible in the long run. Survey analysis provides support to the findings as it shows that retailers and manufacturers are discouraged by the high costs of manufacturing and distributing environment friendly bags. This study carries significant policy implications for key stakeholders; the government should give subsidies and tax incentives to manufacturers and retailers for adopting business process innovation and using environmentally friendly bags. © The Author(s) 2025.","and retailers; business process innovation; dynamic evolutionary game model; government; manufacturers; Pakistan Environment Protection Act of 2019","","S.F.

However, most early studies on socially responsible investment or sustainability investment have only focused on exploring the relationship between corporate sustainability and firm value. Moreover, little has been done to explore the practices of emerging market companies for engaging with a sustainability index. To address this research gap, we employed the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to identify critical factors that influence the inclusion of emerging market companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Five critical factors and best practices were identified based on the analysis of seven Taiwanese electronics companies that have been listed in the DJSI for several consecutive years.

We selected 13 companies (6 LSPs and 7 shippers) and conducted semi-structured interviews to contextualise and elaborate the extant theory. Results highlight that companies seem more motivated by the need to comply with regulations or to protect their environmental reputation than by a genuine understanding of the actual need for sustainability.

Organizations worldwide have confronted these new challenges of sustainable finance by incorporating environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) factors and digital transformation (DT) in their innovation business strategies. The healthcare sector represents a large share of the global economy (about 10% of global economic output), employs a large number of workers, and needs to rely more on an open innovation model where interested parties, especially patients, are going to have a say in their own well-being. Thus, it is imperative that healthcare providers be efficient, effective, resilient, and sustainable in the face of significant challenges and risks. At the same time, they must offer sustainable development goals and digital transformation to healthcare users through limited governmental resources. This study investigates the role, importance, and correlation of ESG factors and digital transformation to the sustainable finance of healthcare systems through an innovative model. The main purpose of the paper is to present the already implemented ESG and DT factors in the healthcare sector and to propose a mutual and combined implementation strategy based on common evaluation tools, methods, and actions. A set of proposed actions and strategies are presented for the sustainability and resilience of the healthcare sector. © 2024 by the authors.","digital transformation; ESG factors; health; healthcare system; open innovation; sustainable finance","","A.

It explores how board features such as size (BSize), diversity (BDIV), independence (BI), skills (Bskill) and duality (CEOD) influence ESG performance (ESG), and how EMT enhances or mitigates these effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a quantitative approach using a dataset of 91 GCC companies covering ten years (2014–2023). Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations among board characteristics, EMT and ESG performance. STATA was used to analyze data extracted from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database. Findings: EMT significantly strengthens the positive influence of BDIV and independence on ESG but shows varied effects with other board attributes. Larger boards and overreliance on skilled boards dilute the effectiveness of EMT. These findings highlight the nuanced role of the EMT in governance dynamics and sustainability outcomes. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of EMTs in enhancing sustainability performance in GCC companies. Firms should prioritise board diversity and independence while balancing board size and skills to maximize EMT effectiveness. Policymakers can develop frameworks promoting EMT integration and governance reforms, aligning corporate strategies with global ESG standards for long-term environmental and social impact. Social implications: The study promotes the integration of governance and sustainability in the GCC, fostering social accountability and environmental stewardship. It encourages companies to adopt diverse and independent boards, creating broader societal benefits by aligning corporate strategies with global sustainability standards. Originality/value: This study is among the first to explore the moderating influence of EMT on the board–ESG relationship within the GCC context, bridging gaps in the existing literature. It offers practical insights into how board composition and environmental governance structures synergistically drive sustainability performance. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Board characteristics; Environmental management team; ESG; Gulf cooperation council; Sustainability performance","","H.H.

This article uses data from A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020 to construct an econometric model to empirically test the impact of resource dependence on ESG performance of enterprises. We find that the corporate ESG scores in regions with high resource dependence will decline. After a series of robustness tests such as replacing the dependent variable, controlling province time fixed effect, eliminating extreme effects, and eliminate provinces with high resource dependence, the conclusion of this article still holds. In addition, we alleviate the endogeneity problem caused by OLS estimation by constructing a dynamic panel model. Further analysis indicates that there are differences in the effect of resource dependence on enterprises sub-scores, with a significant negative impact on the environmental dimension and social dimension, and no significant impact on the governance dimension. It has a greater impact on the ESG score of SOEs and has no significant impact on non-SOEs.

To this end, a questionnaire survey on the attitudes of managers and business owners was conducted in February 2024 in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. Data were collected using the Computer Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) research method. The distribution of respondents by country was as follows: there were 338 respondents from the Czech Republic, 349 from Poland, 312 from Slovakia and 321 from Hungary. Correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were used to test the scientific hypotheses. The results suggest that firms that focus on the environmental education of employees, use green practices, provide truthful information about environmental impacts, and spend adequate costs on environmental protection are more likely to achieve sustainable growth. On the other hand, there appears to be no affect on corporate sustainability from policies pertaining to managing the company in accordance with specific regulations, minimising the environmental impacts of business activities, intensively addressing the energy efficiency of company buildings, and using renewable energy sources. In conclusion, firms in the V4 countries focus on that aspects of Pillar E that affect sustainable growth but do not significantly increase costs or increase the overall complexity of processes. © 2024, Centre of Sociological Research.

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposed a conceptual research model of the relationships and formulated six hypotheses. This study used a structured questionnaire based on previous studies to collect relationship data to test these hypotheses, and 441 full-time managers from various US businesses responded. The complete and valid survey responses were then tested against the hypotheses using IBM SPSS Statistics and SEM-AMOS. Findings: Results supported the relationships proposed in the research model. They indicated that a strong supporting OC and TQMPs might improve positive SP and GPs. Additionally, the more managers are aware of their companies' GPs, the more likely they will feel positive about the organization's SP. Research limitations/implications: A larger sample size to ensure statistically minimum representation in several major industries would better validate the findings and help identify significant differences in industry-specific OCs, TQMPs, GPs and SPs. Similarly, ensuring a varied geographical representation (both within the USA and internationally) would help determine if the findings vary according to the respondent's location. Furthermore, collecting the data during Year 1 of the COVID-19 pandemic may have skewed the results. Thus, once the working environment has been normalized, the survey should be repeated to determine if the findings are valid post-pandemic. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide important strategic guidance for managers who work to balance the implementation of corporate GPs and the triple bottom line dimensions of SP. For practitioners, the results showed that companies could accomplish both profitability and sustainability if they are willing to continuously pay attention to environmental issues and strategically invest in cost-efficient and eco-friendly initiatives. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of the first to explore how OC and TQMPs, directly and indirectly, affect the relationship between GPs and the triple bottom line dimensions of SP.

We argue that via their information intermediary and monitoring capabilities, analysts both react to and act upon transparency in such a way as to affect a firm's investment efficiency. Consistent with prior research, investment efficiency represents a firm's increase in net tangible assets relative to its sales growth. Transparency is based upon comprehensive ratings constructed by Bloomberg. Analysts' information environment is proxied by earnings forecast errors and dispersion. Our sample comprises S&P 500 index firms over 2012–2018. Results show that environmental and social transparencies each positively relate to investment efficiency, with analysts' information environment partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, environmental and social transparencies each relate to smaller forecast errors as well as less forecast dispersion. Furthermore, enhanced analyst forecasts imply less firm-level investment inefficiency. These results suggest that greater environmental and social transparency enhances financial analysts' information environment and, thus, their information intermediary and monitoring capabilities. Consequently, firms are more likely to attain investment efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Analysts' forecast dispersion; Analysts' forecast error; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Environmental transparency; Governance; Investment efficiency; Monitoring; Social transparency","Dispersions; Efficiency; Errors; Investments; Sales; Transparency; Analyst' forecast dispersion; Analyst' forecast error; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental transparency; Forecast errors; Governance; Information environment; Investment efficiency; Social transparencies; Forecasting","M.H.

The responses of 365 managers from various USA businesses in the service industries were analyzed using IBM SPSS and structural equation modeling (SEM)-AMOS. Findings: The empirical results indicate that positive SuP in the economic, environmental and social dimensions and organizational GP can be improved by a strong culture of EO, effective QMP and substantial SE. Practical implications: This research fills the gap in existing research between important organizational and environmental priorities and SuP. Consequently, the study provides managers with important strategic guidance: for environmental practices to achieve profitability and sustainability success, companies must promote an environmental-mindful culture and strategically invest in integrated QM systems.

The total quality is accomplished if all the desired goals including quality of product, reputation in market, services, low cost of product, employee and customer satisfaction, optimum utilization of resources, work environment, and so on are attained. As far as the Pakistani perspective is concerned, TQM as a strategic tool is not appropriately used to optimize its performance. Public healthcare in Pakistan is one of the most ignored sectors with regard to its service quality implementation and delivery. The public sector hospitals are one of the major primary healthcare providers, but the facilities they provide do not meet the desired requirement. This study addresses six TQM attributes to analyze the TQM performance of various public sector teaching hospitals in the province Punjab of Pakistan. The data was obtained from medical experts. The TQM performance to study the behavior of TQM implementation in hospitals is evaluated using TQM digraphs. The hospitals are ranked according to the TQM performance index, which is obtained from TQM digraphs. The technique to find the most effective attribute for a hospital is also proposed. The TQM digraph approach not only focuses on the significance of attributes independently but also incorporates the relative importance of one attribute over another. Also, this approach is very flexible that can incorporate new attributes and market variation so that continuous improvement may be possible. Moreover, the results obtained in this approach are not limited to beneficial for benchmarking of teaching hospitals in Punjab on the TQM basis, but these can also help indicate the particular attribute that is more needed to be improved for a particular hospital to increase its TQM performance.  © 2022 Ahmad Islam and Abdus Salam.","","Benchmarking; Body fluids; Commerce; Customer satisfaction; Directed graphs; Health care; Strategic planning; Total quality management; Customers' satisfaction; Employee satisfaction; Low-costs; Management IS; Multi attribute decision making; Pakistan; Performance; Public sector; Quality of product; Utilization of resources; Hospitals","A.

However, despite their potential for sustainability and continuous improvement, their application and study in the literature have remained largely separated and underexplored. To address this gap, we draw on the institutional and stakeholder theories to examine how green procurement, green product innovation and green process innovation enhance green organizational legitimacy and access to green finance by using TQM as a mediator in these relationships. We used the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique to analyze survey data from 244 manufacturing firms in Ghana. The results showed that green procurement influenced TQM and green organizational legitimacy but not access to green finance. Likewise, green product innovation and green process innovation enhanced TQM, green organizational legitimacy, and access to green finance. TQM had differential degrees of mediation on the effects of green procurement, green product innovation, and green process innovation on green organizational legitimacy and access to green finance. We contribute to prior studies by integrating green manufacturing practices and TQM in ways that help managers of manufacturing firms who wish to unravel the complexities of integrating green manufacturing practices and TQM. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","access to green finance; green organizational legitimacy; green process innovation; green procurement; green product innovation; total quality management","","I.S.K.

This project highlights the value of having a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) in Indonesian MNEs and SOEs. These organizations must acknowledge that they currently lack a CSO at the director level and must assign a CSO to their organizational structure. Strategic leadership, regulatory compliance, stakeholder engagement, innovation and technology adoption, risk mitigation, cost savings, carbon accounting and reporting, and competitive advantage are critical strategic CSOs for Indonesian MNEs and SOEs beyond guaranteeing sustainability. Seventy-six sustainability reports from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) operating in Indonesia listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 2021–2022 are the documents studied in the approaches. The results indicate that a critical prerequisite for long-term development and a way to meet sustainability goals is for Indonesian MNEs and SOEs to designate a CSO. The CSO is essential in promoting sustainable practices, reducing risks, ensuring compliance, and enhancing the company's image in a society that is becoming more environmentally conscious.

First, it discovered that ESG scores have a positive and significant impact on the financial performance of Chinese A-share listed companies. Second, the role of board independence as a moderating variable in the relationship between ESG and corporate financial performance was not statistically significant. Third, ownership concentration in Chinese companies was found to play a moderating role in the relationship between ESG performance and corporate financial performance. The results suggest that, in the case of Chinese companies, ownership concentration by management appears to promote ESG activities and consequently enhance financial performance more than maintaining an independent board.  © 2024 Heonyong Jung, published by Sciendo.","board independence; ESG; financial performance; ownership concentration","","","English","Stud.

The results of an empirical analysis on data from 483 foreign subsidiaries of Korean listed firms collected through surveys from February to May 2021 are as follows. First, it was found that digital transformation capability had a positive effect on financial performance. Second, as a result of analyzing the moderating effect of the ESG level, it was found that the environmental (E) level and the social (S) level in ESG strengthened the positive relationship between digital transformation capability and financial performance. However, it was found that the level of governance (G) in ESG rather weakens the positive relationship between digital transformation capability and financial performance. The results of this study suggest that foreign subsidiaries need to actively build digital transformation capability in order to improve their financial performance.

Nowadays, companies have to deal with the pressures of stakeholders who, also due to the pandemic, are increasingly attentive to the firm’s impacts on the environment and health. Thus, companies voluntarily undertake to provide information on their strategies in a way that better addresses concerns about digitization and sustainability. This paper aims to analyze the impact of digital technologies on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. To this end, a cross-case analysis of companies active in the Italian agri-food sector was carried out. In more detail, a content analysis methodology has been used to analyze the published sustainability reports, focusing on the digital technologies used and identifying the SDGs already reached and/or reachable by the company. Digital technologies have been classified, and each technology has been associated with appropriate SDGs through a deductive approach. Findings demonstrate a clear link between digitalization the SDGs achievement.

E-commerce firms, therefore, grapple with balancing short promised delivery times (PDT) and environmental sustainability in a competitive landscape. Through a game-theoretic lens, this study delves into the logistics choices of two rival e-commerce firms. These firms can either manage their own logistics or outsource to third-party logistics providers (TPLs) that have a green edge due to advanced eco-friendly technologies. Our findings reveal that if the e-commerce firms compete on demand, their logistics strategies depend on the TPLs’ levels of green technology readiness. Conversely, intense PDT competition can diminish the TPLs’ benefits, prompting e-commerce firms to handle logistics in-house. Regarding environmental sustainability, the outcomes depend on whether demand or PDT competition drives the firms’ choices. Notably, if both firms compete on PDT, the most sustainable outcome remains elusive. Our conclusions remain consistent even when tested further by model extensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","E-commerce; Environmental sustainability; Logistics service outsourcing; Promised delivery time (PDT)","Competition; Game theory; Outsourcing; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Delivery time; E- commerces; Environmental sustainability; Logistic service outsourcing; Logistics services; Online consumers; Promised delivery time; Service outsourcing; Third party logistics providers; Electronic commerce","D.

This is partly because the themes covered by ESG scores are intended to resolve multiple major social and environmental issues. However, there is little consensus among academics about the definition of ESG scores and their measures. Many scholars have used ESG scores to represent various issues. The purpose of this study is to gather all definitions that were used by scholar when using ESG scores in their research. Design/methodology/approach: This systematic literature review aims to identify how ESG scores are presented in the academic literature. A total of 4,145 articles were identified, of which 342 articles from influential peer-reviewed journals were retained. Findings: In the articles, five different thematic definitions emerged in terms of how scholars have used ESG scores in their research: sustainability, corporate social responsibility, disclosure, finance and the analysis of ESG scores. Although some definitions are consistent with the methodologies of the agencies that produce ESG scores, others raise further questions. Caution is required when using ESG scores as a metric. They represent financial adjusted risk-return for some and are used to express business sustainability for others. Research limitations/implications: Only top-ranked journals were analyzed. In addition, only the key terms “ESG Score” and “ESG Scores” were used to gather all research papers. Practical implications: Researchers could improve the accuracy of their results by developing specific methodologies that are closely related to the issues intended to be measured. The underlying variables composing the ESG scores could be used instead of the final score for more accurate environmental or social issues measurements. Originality/value: This research shows that scholars use ESG scores to represent multiple issues that are not always captured by ESG scores’ official methodologies. ESG scores can express the overall performance of environmental and social issues, but they cannot be used to track specific underlying issues. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; ESG; ESG definitions; ESG scores; Sustainability","","A.

It also examines how CSR characteristics and green product strategies have evolved across regions and time. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of listed banks from different economic areas over the period 2010–2019, the authors examine how CSR mechanisms at the governance level and green product strategies, which they categorize through principal component analysis, have changed over time and across regions. The authors then conducted panel regression to identify which CSR characteristics affect the likelihood that banks implement green product strategies. Findings: Results show that CSR mechanisms related to bank transparency and commitment to the community, such as sustainability reporting and United Nations Global Compact adherence, are substantive in affecting the likelihood of banks pursuing green product strategies. In contrast, mechanisms related to internal organization, such as the presence of a CSR Committee and an environmental management team, tend to play more a symbolic role. Findings also support a reconsideration of environmental, social and governance-related compensation schemes, which appear to decrease the likelihood that banks engage in some forms of green financing. The likelihood of banks pursuing green product strategies varies across regions and has increased after the Paris Agreement. Research limitations/implications: The findings are useful in guiding regulators, supervisory authorities and policymakers in defining policies that can create conditions for banks to develop green products and, hence, encourage the sustainability behaviors of their clients. Empirical evidence reveals that some corporate governance mechanisms and green product strategies correlate positively, institutional factors matter and public policies can play a role in strengthening such a correlation. However, results are limited to specific geographical areas and listed banks. Originality/value: This study contributes to the institutional literature by showing that some corporate governance mechanisms are substantive in increasing the likelihood of banks pursuing green product strategies, while others are more symbolic. It also extends the literature by analyzing how banks belonging to different geographical areas have responded, over time, to sustainability objectives. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Green assets under management; Green loans; Sustainable finance","","V.

This study calculated sectoral blue water footprints (WFs) in water scarce Pakistan between 1971 and 2020. Agriculture dominates blue WFs, industry contributed 0.5–1.4%, municipal WFs 0.5–1.7%. Manufacture (cloth and yarn) and electricity production (hydropower) dominated blue industrial WFs. Agricultural crop and livestock production tripled using the same amount of blue water, but industrial and municipal WFs increased with increasing production/population, the blue industrial WF by a factor of 3.3, municipal WFs by a factor of 3.6. Pakistan's water scarcity depends on environmental flow requirement (EFR) definitions. Volumetric government definitions generate low water scarcity allocating almost all water to society. Higher EFR's generate moderate to severe scarcity. Efficient agriculture leaves more water for industry and municipal supply, increasing crop output and decreasing sectoral competition.

The results show that this issue is highly context-dependent, and further research is required considering the institutional context and features of the industry and firms under study. Similarly, the underlying relationship mechanisms between environmental criteria adoption and performance also require further research. This paper analyzes this relationship and the mediating role of innovation practices in Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It examines SMEs in four industries, distinguishing between micro, small, and medium-sized firms. A stratified sample of 1,044 Spanish SMEs was collected. The sample was representative of the SME population in terms of industry, size, and region. The PROCESS macro and bootstrapping were employed to estimate the indirect, total, and direct effects and test the proposed hypotheses. This research sheds light on the relationships between environmental criteria adoption and performance, thereby addressing recent calls in the literature. The total effect of environmental criteria adoption on firm performance is positive and significant, regardless of size or industry. However, the direct relationship between environmental criteria adoption and performance may be small and sometimes non-significant. In contrast, the effect is higher and statistically significant under mediation by innovation practices. Industry and company size moderate the impact of environmental criteria adoption on performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Entrepreneurial firms; Environmental practices; Innovation; Performance; SMEs","","J.A.

This paper aims to identify and analyse the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sectoral performance of economic entities listed on regulated stock exchanges across Western Europe. The data were collected from the platform provided by Damodaran Online and S&P 500 and certain eligibility criteria were established based on the decision tree method in order to select the sample of 837 companies. Empirical results suggest that sustainable growth in conditions of economic and health crisis was a leading variable in a statistically significant positive correlation between the net investments in R&D, unadjusted ROE, ROIC, Debts, Equity cost and ROC-WACC in the years of pandemic crisis. The developed models are a support tool that can be used by stakeholders in approaching the competitiveness of the sector, as they are based on objective data, reported by the analysed companies and can serve to avoid unprofitable investments, financing some sectors to the detriment of others, or establishing sustainable business relationships, especially in times of crisis. © 2024 The Authors.","effects of COVID-19; financial indicators; sectoral competitiveness; sustainability","","S.

This paper further examined the moderating effect of organizational strategy in the hypothesized relationship. Using a positivistic research approach, a sample of 600 service industry personnel were surveyed. The 491 retrieved usable responses were analysed using regression, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. It emerged that CSR fulfilment has a significant effect on firm innovation. Also, the positive relationship between CSR fulfilment and firm innovation was not significantly moderated by organizational strategy. The results imply that CSR fulfilment affects the innovative behaviour of firms to produce services that differentiate them from their competitors. Consequently, focus should be placed on designing workable CSR implementation plans backed by appropriate human resource capacity to make the firm successful. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Community pressure and awareness; Competitiveness; Corporate social responsibility; CSR competitiveness; Firm innovation; Market uncertainty; Organizational strategy; Responsible leadership; Service industry; Technology changes","","R.A.

Scarce research has been reported on such applications in North American Climate. Ottawa is characterized by its harsh winter climate where temperatures can be as low as -30 °C. The paper presents a performance comparison between three stores: an original store, a new nearby store for the same company, and a proposed energy efficient store to replace the second store. The proposed store by the authors considers the implementation of a number of proposed retrofits. The simulations were performed on the eQuest software. The model results were validated against collected site data with a maximum deviation of 5%. The results have shown that space heating, and light technology upgrades constitute a major contributor to potential energy saving. The upgraded store energy consumption is about 39% lower than the original one. The space heating upgrade contributes to more than 60% of this saving potential, and the light upgrade makes up for the rest. In addition, economic analysis performed on RETScreen software has revealed that the proposed measures have a payback of 5 years. This is considered reasonable for the application. The debt ratio and interest rates have adverse effect on increasing the payback. Renewable (solar thermal, and photovoltaic) integration can double the payback of the project due to the high cost of PV panels. The current study is a valuable guidance for widespread retail stores in North America. © 2023 The Author(s)","","","H.M.

Design/methodology/approach: This research employs a system-generalized method of moments (GMM) technique to analyze 605 Indian firms listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2015 to 2023. The methodology ensures robust and endogeneity-resistant results, reliably assessing the relationship between the variables. Findings: The study indicates that ESG factors influence corporate outcomes differently across industries, and simply following sustainability – is somewhat naïve. In SI industries, ESG efforts show an insignificant association and implementing effective systems for corporate governance reduces profitability due to challenges and scrutiny from stakeholders. Conversely, NSI corporations benefit significantly from ESG practices, enhancing long-term value and investor appeal. Originality/value: The research offers novelty and contributes to the existing literature by providing robust empirical evidence on the diverse impact of ESG (and its dimensions). It underscores the necessity for concerned companies, especially in emerging economies, to customize sustainable strategies that align with their unique operational contexts. The findings provide valuable insights for managers seeking to effectively manage ESG implementation and its financial effects, enhancing strategic approaches to sustainability in different industry contexts. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance disclosure; Corporate performance; Environmental disclosure; Environmental sensitivity; ESG disclosure; Indian firms; Social disclosure; System-generalized method of moments (GMM)","","P.

This study takes Chinese listed real estate companies as the research sample, puts inter-firm competitive interaction into a multi-market contact situation which is more in line with the competition reality, and at the same time expands the scope of action to the non-market area, and expands the scope of action to the non-market area to explore the impact of multimarket contact on the rent seeking actions of enterprises. The results show that: Firstly, multimarket contact has an inverted U-shape influence on rent seeking, with mutual forbearance effects occurring in the non-market field when the indicator of multimarket exceeds a critical value; secondly, there is a negative correlation between rent seeking and firm performance, and rent seeking does not necessarily lead to improved firm performance; thirdly, rent seeking will play a mediating role between multimarket contact and performance. When faced with the pressure of multimarket competition, firms seek to enhance their performance by engaging in rent seeking behaviors in non-market domains; fourthly, institutional environment will weaken the influence of multimarket contact on rent seeking. The above conclusions indicate that when faced with multiple market contacts, firms often adopt a strategy of “Do one thing under cover of another”. While mutual forbearance may be observed among firms in the market domain, they covertly seek to launch attacks through non-market competitive actions, ultimately resulting in competition spillover into non-market domains. The research findings effectively expand the current theoretical research on multi-market competition and provide valuable insights for multimarket firms to better grasp inter-firm competitive interactions. © 2024 Systems Engineering Society of China.

The objective of this article is to verify whether there is a correlation between the implementation of ESG strategies and financial data and indicators. The first part of the discussion highlights the essence of a socially responsible investment—a concept that postulates the consideration of social responsibility in the functioning of companies. At a further stage, an attempt is made to systematize the concepts of ESG investing, where three key aspects are highlighted, i.e., environmental, social, and corporate governance. The article also refers to the reporting non-financial data, which are indicated by SASB standards. An empirical study is conducted on the UNIMOT Group. In this respect, the adjustment of ESG strategy directions with disclosure topics defined within the oil and gas midstream sector is analyzed. Then, using the GRETL econometric package, the relationship between the selected financial data is verified for the periods analyzed, with particular emphasis on the year of implementation of the ESG strategy, i.e., 2021.

The purpose of this paper is to discover to what extent the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region corporations carry out various aspects of corporate sustainability. This paper studies corporate sustainability practices and examines the association between corporate sustainability practices and performance in the MENA region. Design/methodology/approach: A thorough literature review was conducted. The findings indicate six key categories/constructs that can be used as indicators for measuring corporate sustainability and performance. Based on the literature review, a theoretical framework was constructed and tested. Data for this quantitative and explanatory study were obtained through a self-administered survey which was distributed to senior managers at corporations in the MENA region. Findings: The findings of this study show that the corporations operating in the MENA region are underachieving in all aspects of sustainability except for the energy management facet. Larger-sized companies tend to be more involved in corporate sustainability practices in the categories of internal and external education, external health and resources and energy management. This study finds the existence of a strong positive relationship between each sustainability category and each performance category. Originality/value: Most studies on sustainability focus on North America, Europe and East Asia, not the MENA region. The findings will help corporations in the MENA region become aware of the importance of increasing their engagement in the sustainability aspects that they lack, as this will lead to a boost of their overall performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate performance; MENA corporations; Strategic planning MENA; Sustainability MENA; Sustainable development","","R.

However, methods for effectively regulating GWBs in GFPs are unclear. This study constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model to analyze the formation and governance mechanisms of GWBs in GFPs among regulatory authorities, enterprises, and investors. Subsequently, the stability equilibrium strategy and key factors influencing the system equilibrium were discussed. Several interesting conclusions were drawn. First, we demonstrated that an interdependence mechanism exists among three game agents who mutually influence each other. The larger the probability of regulatory authorities choosing active supervision and investors adopting feedback, the more enterprises are willing to carry out green projects. Second, three corresponding governance modes for GWBs were put forward following the developmental stages of GFPs. Among these, the collaboration mode is the most effective in incentivizing enterprises to implement green projects. Third, based on sensitivity simulations, the initial willingness of the tripartite stakeholders, investor feedback cost, investor compensation, the penalty for greenwashing enterprises, and the reputational benefit of enterprises are critical factors that influence evolutionary results. Finally, targeted countermeasures were provided for regulatory authorities to prevent enterprises from engaging in GWBs. © 2024, The Author(s).","Evolutionary game; Green finance product; Greenwashing behaviors; Investor feedback","","Q.

However, the collaboration between AI and HI, crucial for augmenting the creation of green value and achieving sustainable development in manufacturing firms, remains ambiguous. We employed panel data from 935 A-share listed manufacturing firms in China (2010−2022) to reveal the potential influence mechanism of AI and HI collaboration on green value creation. Our findings revealed that AI technology adoption facilitated manufacturing firms in harnessing their HI for green value creation. Under the influence of AI technology adoption, HI, as with manufacturing firms' human and structural capital, contributed positively to green value creation. It is noteworthy that while higher-quality relational capital served as a potential driving force for manufacturing firms in creating green value, heightened AI technology adoption significantly impeded enthusiasm for this mechanism. The conclusions elucidate the intricate relationship between AI and HI collaboration and green value creation, expanding the application of technology adoption within the green innovation ecosystem.

This study examined how the performance of Ghanaian waste management companies is affected by circular economy strategies, particularly upcycling and was recovery. Methods: About 7,190 firms registered with the Environmental Service Providers Association (ESPA) formed the population of the study, out of which the sample yielded 524 valid responses, which was analysed using PLS-SEM and Partial Correlation Analysis. PLS was adopted because it integrates factor and route analyses into significantly more rigorous statistical processes. In addition, the Partial Correlation network structure was adopted to explain how the nodes or variables are related to one another. Results: The results demonstrate that upcycling has a favorable and considerable impact on the economic performance (β = 0.475, t = 4.495, p = 0.000), social performance (β = 0.403, t = 3.132, p = 0.002), and corporate governance performance (β = 0.455, t = 3.670, p = 0.000) of the firms. Furthermore, waste recovery improved the performance of waste management companies in terms of performance, specifically economic performance (β = 0.333, t = 3.183, p = 0.001), environmental performance (β = 0.583, t = 4.641, p = 0.000), social performance (β = 0.402, t = 3.157, p = 0.000), and corporate governance performance (β = 0.250, t = 2. 024, p = 0.048) indices. Discussion: Finally, circular economy practices have a substantial impact on firms’ financial stability and investment readiness. It was concluded that waste management companies that excel in undertaking circular economy activities such as remanufacturing, trash recycling, and refurbishing are more likely to draw clients who want green activities in addition to their current needs. Additionally, these actions increase efficiency, which lowers operational expenses and improves governance-related concerns, including management training on these procedures and implementation of policies in compliance with the law.

However, with increasing expectations of sustainable performance, companies encounter mounting financial pressure to adopt more efficient sustainable practices, which may lead some to exploit sustainability efforts for their own gain. Many companies make environmentally friendly assertions to conceal or mask their actual activities—a phenomenon known as greenwashing—which fosters public scepticism about the authenticity of their green messaging. This study employs an event study methodology to examine how the stock market values greenwashing news, drawing on 121 global greenwashing news since the 2015 Paris Agreement. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between greenwashing news and stock market reactions. The market reactions to greenwashing news are more negative for firms with greater ESG performance than for weak ESG performance. Additionally, greenwashing news supported by concrete evidence elicits stronger adverse reactions. Companies operating in the manufacturing industry experience more significant market value losses than those in the service sector. The findings also indicate that the Asia-Pacific market demonstrates particularly strong negative responses to greenwashing news compared to other stock markets.

Our understanding of what constitutes sustainability is evolving, especially nowadays when the pandemic and digitalization caused major shifts globally. In such conditions, it is no wonder that managers and business owners may face difficulties in implementation and evaluation of sustainable practices. Therefore, The objective: of the paper is to examine theoretical foundations of the concept of business sustainability and propose an up-to-date model for its appraisal. The paper is divided into two primary parts in addition to introduction and conclusion. The first part is dedicated to the examination of the terms ‘stability’ and ‘sustainability’ universally and in business environment. The second part includes description of our suggested evaluation model of economic, social and environmental sustainability perspectives using relevant indicators. Methods/Analysis: the research includes review of academic literature and empirical research on the topic of business sustainability and analytical consolidation of existing approaches to its appraisal. Findings: theoretical contribution to perception and development of the conditions of business stability and sustainability, and evaluation model including specific indicators across the three primary sustainability directions.

Innovation that does not imply company achievements might exhaust their limited resources and cause the market to be uncompetitive. This paper aims to answer two research questions: (1) Do innovation strategies, such as process, marketing and social innovation, affect the performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? (2) Does company size moderate the relationship between social and marketing innovations with SMEs' performance? Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposed three innovation strategies (i.e. social, marketing and process innovations) influencing Malaysian SMEs' performance. There were 123 valid respondents from SMEs, and the data were analysed using a structural equation modelling partial least square (SEM-PLS) technique. Findings: The research findings advocate that process innovation directly impacts SMEs' performance, not marketing innovation. Interestingly, the influence of social innovation on organisation performance is only significant when the company size becomes more prominent. Companies can provide consistent and continuous social enhancement that arouses public trust and reputation with more resources and capabilities. Also, smaller companies might concentrate their scarce resources on process innovation with instant beneficial potential instead of a sophisticated marketing strategy. Originality/value: There is limited empirical research examining how different innovation strategies, especially social innovation, affect SMEs' performance in developing countries. Furthermore, the second-generation analysis (PLS-SEM) technique provides more systematic and comprehensive results. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate strategy; Marketing innovation; Process innovation; Resource-based theory; SME performance; Social innovation","","Y.

The challenges were further classified based on importance and their influencing power. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses the novel causal modelling technique of GINA to study and understand the influence relations among the challenges to implementation of Industry 5.0. Findings: Based on the results from the expert response-based study in the Indian manufacturing industry, it is seen that the Regulatory challenges (RGC) appear to be the most important challenge that needs to be tackled first, while implementing Industry 5.0. Integration with existing systems and Ethical challenges (ETC) emerge as the second and third most important in the category of challenges, as per the results from the GINA analysis. Research limitations/implications: The RGC and the ETC need to be addressed prior to implementation and it is necessary to check whether the technologies comply with regulations and whether it creates serious job displacements. While implementation, the challenges with integration to existing systems can be appropriately tackled. Practical implications: As a practical implication of the study, the author suggests that a proactive and reactive approach can be adopted to implement the Industry 5.0 concepts to reality. The RGC can be viewed for the adoption of technology, integration challenges can be viewed by understanding the existing systems, and ETC can be addressed by understanding the workforce in combination with technologies.

As a result of the intersection between the GRI and SDG indicators with COBIT requirements, a set of 50 indicators covering four dimensions of sustainability was identified. In the environmental dimension, 11 indicators were identified, in the economic dimension six indicators, in social dimension 14 indicators, and, at last, in the governance dimension, there were 19 convergent indicators between COBIT and GRI. This set of 50 proposed indicators was validated by analyzing the content of the sustainability reports available on the websites of information technology companies, making it possible to relate the sustainable practices and strategies adopted by such companies with the indicators suggested in this study.

It also analyses the effects of the environment, social, governance, and cross-cutting issues on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilizes a sample of Indian firms from the Reprisk® database, amounting to 1,103 CSiR media coverage counts for 693 firm-year annual observations from 2008 to 2015. Further, Reprisk® segregates comprehensive CSiR coverage counts into the environment, social, governance and cross-cutting issues, for which the study runs the fixed effects panel regression. The study takes year-fixed effects, industry-fixed effects and clustered standard errors at the industry level. Findings: The results of this study indicate that CSiR coverage negatively influences the firm performance of Indian firms. All issues, including social, governance and cross-cutting, except environmental issues, negatively impact firm value in India. Practical implications: The involvement of firms in CSiR costs the firms financially and drives down firm performance. Social issues, including community and employee-related matters, governance issues and cross-cutting issues, also reduce the firm performance. Social implications: The insignificant environmental impact on firm performance does not indicate that environmental issues have no detrimental consequences. Instead, it might need more stakeholders' awareness to understand the harmful implications of environmental issues on society. Originality/value: Limited studies have explored CSiR in India so far.

However, there is little research examining the role of responsible innovation in promoting firms' sustainable development. Based on the extended resource-based view (ERBV), this article examines the impact of responsible innovation on firms' sustainable performance via business network resilience. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we use data from 422 Chinese manufacturing firms and find that responsible innovation has a positive effect on firms' sustainable performance and that business network resilience plays a mediating role in this relationship. Additionally, this article shows that both absorptive capacity and social media adoption not only moderate the relationship between responsible innovation and business network resilience, as well as the relationship between business network resilience and sustainable performance, but that they also moderate the mediating effect of business network resilience on the relationship between responsible innovation and sustainable performance. Using the ERBV perspective, this article contributes to the existing literature by extending current discussions on the relationship between responsible innovation and sustainable performance into the area of business network resilience while also elaborating on the roles of absorptive capacity and social media adoption in moderating this relationship.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Business network resilience; extended resource-based view; responsible innovation; social media; sustainable performance","COVID-19; Planning; Social networking (online); Business network resilience; Business networks; Collaboration; Extended resource-based view; Network resilience; Resilience; Resource-based view; Responsible innovation; Social media; Stakeholder; Sustainable performance; Technological innovation; Uncertainty; Sustainable development","Y.

The results of the mechanism tests show that ESG ratings inhibit managerial myopia by alleviating financing constraints, improving accounting information quality, and enhancing analysts' attention. The results of heterogeneity tests show that a higher degree of market competition indicates a more significant inhibitory effect of ESG ratings on managerial myopia.

This paper utilizes COVID-19 shocks and uses data from listed companies in China for 2019–2021 in order to study the impact of internal control on enterprise resilience and its functioning mechanism. The findings show that internal control significantly improves enterprise resilience during a crisis. By using firm characteristic quantile regressions, it is found that under a crisis, larger firms with sufficient cash flow from operating activities are more protected by internal control and more resilient. Mechanistic analysis suggests that internal control further increases enterprise resilience by improving resource allocation efficiency, reducing operating risk, and increasing innovation output. Further analysis shows that government support can enhance the resilience of firms during crises through tax and fiscal policies; a better business environment enhances firms’ ability to withstand risks in crisis situations and helps them gain a competitive advantage in crisis situations. Based on this, this paper provides empirical evidence for revising and improving the internal control system of enterprises to reduce the negative impact of public health emergencies in the context of epidemics. © 2022 by the authors.","enterprise resilience; innovation output; internal control; operating risk; resource allocation efficiency","China; business development; control system; COVID-19; fiscal policy; governance approach; government; industrial enterprise; innovation; public health; resource allocation; risk assessment","C.

However, additional traits should also be measured and compared in terms of their impact on the broader definition of sustainability. In addition to environmental impact, a sustainable breeding objective must consider profit, animal welfare, farmer well-being, and social responsibility. Traits to be considered include direct emissions (e.g., nitrogen and methane), production efficiency (e.g., feed efficiency), health (e.g., calf and transition cow health), and welfare traits (e.g., polled). Many of these novel traits require labor- and cost-intensive phenotyping procedures. Consequently, this results in relatively modest data sets and estimated breeding values with limited reliability. Opportunities exist to overcome this limitation by developing cost-effective and easily quantifiable proxy traits and utilizing international collaboration to expand novel phenotype reference populations. Furthermore, noneconomic values can be estimated to quantify the impact of a trait on societal perspective (e.g., farmer preference) or environmental impact (methane emissions), and combined with economic weights to calculate aggregate weights for each trait. Although validation techniques are still uncertain, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals may be applied to determine the improvement in sustainability due to genetic selection. This approach provides the flexibility to accommodate diverse sustainability perspectives, encompassing the disparities between developed and developing countries. Currently, the number and quality of relevant phenotypes are the main limiting factor. However, as confidence grows in the opportunity to improve sustainability through genetic selection, substantial new investment will be required in both refining phenotyping methodologies and conceptualizing novel breeding designs. © 2024","","","C.M.

Previous sustainability studies do not offer a comprehensive discussion of features key to the European setting. Despite their important role in the European economy, research on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and financial institutions (i.e. insurers and banks) is limited. Furthermore, regions in southern and particularly eastern Europe, which are critical given regulators’ objectives for European Union-wide and global sustainability standards, are neglected. Finally, studies on non-financial effects of sustainability reporting are also limited, and only a few studies differentiate between stakeholder- and shareholder-oriented countries. This is needed for a holistic view on sustainability beyond financial performance.

Accordingly, this investigation has tried to investigate how OL contributes to the firm's performance through the CSR strategies. It has an internal orientation to CSR motivations compared to the existing studies that mostly considered the external factors in implementing of CSR in firms; also, it has a comprehensive view toward the firm's performance by considering both financial and non-financial aspects of performance. It could be said that this study has tried to answer the question of whether or not CSR can be as a mediator between the OL and firm performance. Data collection was performed from 285 manufacturing and consumer products firms located in Malaysia during the four-month period of June–September of 2020. AMOS Structural Equation Modeling (AMOS-SEM) method was applied to analyze the model. Following the Baron and Kenny approach in testing the hypotheses, it was found that the relationships of OL and financial performance, as well as OL and non-financial performance were partially mediated by CSR. In addition, the non-financial performance was found as a full mediator between the OL and financial performance. Further, the results revealed two full mediated relationships in this way that non-financial performance was a full mediator variable between CSR and financial performance, as well as CSR and non-financial performance which were found as two multiple full mediators between OL and financial performance. The results help Malaysian managers to understand their current status, capabilities, strong points and weaknesses in leadership regarding to CSR. Moreover, due to the positive effects of CSR on both firm's financial and non-financial performance, CSR is recommended to be integrated in leadership style and the organizational strategies in order to having better performance. © 2021","Corporate social responsibility; Financial performance; Malaysia; Non-financial performance; Organizational leadership","","P.

Particularly, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have the resources needed to reduce emissions. The purpose of the study is to investigate which GHG reduction technologies would be appropriate for SMEs to efficiently reduce emissions by lessening the economic loss during the transition to green manufacturing. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is employed to prioritize the GHG reduction technologies for SMEs in the manufacturing sector. Groups with a consistency ratio (CR) below 0.1 and a group with a CR below 0.2 are divided for comparison. The results show that, in both the CR < 0.1 and CR < 0.2 groups, “Innovative industrial process” is the most essential criterion among the three criteria. Regarding the sub-criterion, “Electrification of manufacturing facilities” is the most important, followed by “Management after process”. CR < 0.1 and CR < 0.2 groups do not show a large difference in prioritization. Based on the results, it is suggested that an eco-industrial park be established to achieve progress in a collective manner.

An analysis of data from 306 NEV owners in four Chinese cities demonstrated that ECSR directly and indirectly, via green trust and green brand image, shapes green purchasing intentions positively. However, green self-concept consistency was found to weaken the connections ECSR, green trust, and green brand image. From a theoretical perspective, this exploration enhances our understanding of environmentally-driven micro-CSR (individual-level CSR) by shedding light on the factors influencing consumers' intentions to engage in green consumption (new energy) of high involvement products (vehicles).

In the context of the progressive shift to CEs, we critically review extant literature to comprehend the trends and constraints concerning the adoption of CE practices, with a primary focus on India. Our review reveals the growing body of literature encompassing a range of CE practices prevalent in multiple domains globally. We also discuss the emergent trends and patterns in adopting CE across sectors in India. Our study also confirms that implementing the transition to CE with ad hoc policies or as a tactical response to external or internal stimuli is unsustainable; instead, it necessitates organisational agility and strategic collaboration among stakeholders. We also identify consumer perceptions and economic feasibility as the most significant criteria determining the institutionalisation of CE. Further, responding to calls for an investigation into the CE in small and medium enterprises in India, we present a conceptual framework that can enable a non-disruptive transition towards CE. This framework discusses the interlinkages of the above objectives and underscores the need for collaborative efforts from all stakeholders towards a sustainable CE. When practices align with these objectives, firms can successfully manage low environmental impacts while enhancing their economic relevance and social responsibility. The paper also adds to the ongoing investigations into the intersection of the Circular Economy (CE) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by outlining both direct connections (SDG 12) and indirect relationships (SDGs 2, 6, 8, and 13) among the three key pillars of CE: society, environment, and economy. © 2025 by the authors.","CE policies; circular economy; ReSOLVE; SDG; strategic enablers","India; circular economy; conceptual framework; development strategy; paradigm shift; stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal","A.

However, the exact impact of ESG ratings on firms' digital innovation still needs to be explored. This study fills this gap by analysing the impact of ESG ratings on digital technology using a DID model with panel data of 18,741 listed companies in China's A share market from 2009 to 2021. Results show that higher ESG ratings have a significant positive impact on firms' digital technology innovation. ESG ratings foster digital technology innovation by driving increased R&D investment, enhancing financing opportunities, mitigating uncertainties tied to ESG indicators, and strengthening corporate reputation. This study further highlights how the impact of ESG ratings on digital technology innovation varies across regions and industries. Firms in high-tech sectors, heavily polluting industries, and the eastern and central regions of China derive the most benefit from the positive influence of ESG ratings on digital technology innovation. In contrast, Western regions, non-high-tech industries, and non-heavily polluting industries are less responsive to the positive impact of ESG ratings on digital technology innovation. This study offers strategic insights for business leaders, highlighting the role of ESG ratings in driving digital innovation. It also provides valuable guidance for policymakers to create targeted policies that foster technological advancement and promote sustainable growth across industries and regions. © 2024","Digital technology innovation; ESG ratings; Financing constraints; Research and development, sustainability","","A.I.

However, the region has been threatened by increased rates of deforestation and degradation, which is often reported as the failure of the Brazilian conservation policy that could affect the image of agriculture Brazilian products abroad. In this sense, here we aimed to evaluate the foreign environmental perception of the region using data from social medias, to assess which are the main terms related to the region, how their importance varies over time and whether this perception tends to be more negative or positive. For this, we used data from posts made on Twitter® involving the term “Amazon rainforest” over 18 weeks using a data mining process. From these posts, we extracted the text, which went through steps of cleaning and organization, as well as crossing with additional databases (such as the sentiment dictionary). From the final data set, we first evaluated which are the main terms present in these posts and how their importance varied in the evaluated period. Next, we assess whether the terms cited are mainly negative or positive and how this sentiment varied over the monitoring period. Results: We found that the main terms are related to the environmental context such as “carbon”, “deforestation” and “fire” and that there is a relationship between their importance and the occurrence of fires in the region, which is positive with a temporal lag. In addition, we also found that the posts are, on average, composed of 68.47% of negative terms and that this sentiment predominates throughout the entire time series, being higher during the fire peaks in the region. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the environmental perception of the region presented in the posts in Twitter® is mainly negative, due to the degradation and fires observed over the last few years. We also discuss limitations of the approach and establish perspectives for future work. © 2023, Federal University of Lavras.

CSR has been highly linked to public procurement, which is related to government policy and involves purchasing goods and services from others from public bodies. Despite the extensive coverage that CSR has garnered in relation to large multinational corporations, its implementation within the context of SMEs has been found to be severely inadequate. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses science mapping through bibliometric analysis to investigate the existing knowledge structure of CSR in SMEs from 1993–2024. Using bibliographic coupling and co-word analysis, this study evaluates the current structure and potential future trends of CSR in SMEs within public procurement and suggests possible crucial themes for future studies. Findings: The findings indicate the indispensability of integrating CSR as an organizational ethos, given its potential to create a positive impact on the firm’s overall value proposition and long-term profitability. There are four current themes derived: Fundamental of CSR in SMEs, CSR and firm performance, CSR sustainability management and implementation in SMEs, and SMEs size in CSR implementation. There are three future themes derived: Strategies for successful CSR through governance and stakeholder engagement, Relationship between CSR, financial and environmental performance and effective management and Sustainable development through corporate responsibility and performance. SMEs as critical components in the public and private network, hold the key to substantial national economic growth. The public environment would be shaped by how SMEs conduct their business within the public procurement sphere. Social implications: SMEs need to actively participate in CSR activities to stay relevant in today’s market. Securing public procurement relies heavily on CSR as part of the government’s commitment to helping small businesses, reducing unemployment, employing disabled workers, gender equality and implementing national industrial policy. Originality/value: The originality is to provide an in-depth understanding of the role of CSR in SMEs within public procurement by performing science mapping and content analysis of the current phenomenon. This study presents comprehensive research streams in the context of public procurement on the current and future themes based on network visualization through science mapping analysis. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Corporate social responsibility; Public procurement; Science mapping; Small and medium enterprise","","M.A. Fauzi; Faculty of Industrial Management, Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah, Kuantan, Malaysia; email: ashrafauzi@gmail.com","English","J.

For this reason, quality management models, primarily Total Quality Management, have expanded their scope to accommodate other dimensions, such as including social and environmental responsibility in quality policies and objectives. Several studies have highlighted the solid interdependencies and points of contact between quality management and sustainability. However, to date, no publications have been reported to provide a new definition of the concept of quality management capable of incorporating the concept of sustainability encompassing the three pillars (economic, social, and environmental). Through a systematic literature review on Scopus and Web of Sciences, the study analysed the definitions of Total Quality Management and sustainability cited in 91 articles from an initial sample of 2,534 papers. After analysing the most recurring keywords and identifying the main topics, the research proposes a new definition of Total Quality Management, including the three pillars of sustainability.

The study introduces institutional confluence—a configuration of institutional pressures that enhance business model legitimacy to stakeholders and facilitate operational success— which can serve as a driver aligning servitization with circular principles. Institutional confluence has the capacity to trigger novel business models, shape resources and processes, enhance value capture, and inhibit unsustainable business models. The study develops the concept and underscores the role of institutional confluence in promoting this alignment and subsequent environmental sustainability. The article utilizes illustrative case examples from servitization and circular business models to develop the concept of institutional confluence serving sustainable servitization. The study offers strategic insights for managers and policymakers, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that integrates servitization and circularity from the outset of business model design. It advocates for policies that leverage regulatory, normative, and mimetic pressures to foster sustainable business practices. The article contributes to the servitization literature by delineating the mechanisms through which institutional forces facilitate or hinder the integration of servitization and circularity, offering directions for future research to explore these dynamics across different contexts and industries. © 2024","Business models; Circularity; Institutional confluence; Servitization","Business models; Circularity; Conceptual study; Environmental sustainability; Institutional confluence; Institutional pressures; Policy makers; Servitization; Sustainable business; Value captures; Sustainable development","D.

This paper aims to examine the influence of digital transformation on corporate total factor productivity by investigating whether and how corporate technical cooperation and ESG performance mediate and moderate the relationship between them. Methods: This study choose Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms from 2016–2020 as the research sample and use the FGLS regression model to test the proposed hypotheses. Results: Results show that digital transformation has a positive effect on corporate total factor productivity, and this positive impact is more pronounced when corporates have higher ESG performance. Corporate technical cooperation plays a mediating role between digital transformation and total factor productivity. ESG performance also plays a positive moderating role in the relationship between digital transformation and corporate technical cooperation.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a sample of 1,171 sustainability reports published in the year 2017 by organisations from Asia and Africa's low- and middle-income countries. Findings: Results from the Probit model reveal that corruption negatively affects corporate sustainability reporting activity. Indeed, the more companies are exposed to high levels of corruption, the less likely they appear to engage in sustainability reporting. Furthermore, the authors find clear regional and sector-level differences in the extent to which companies engage in sustainability reporting. The results show that Asian companies operating in the agricultural and financial services sectors exhibit significantly higher reporting activity, whilst those operating in the construction and mining sectors report less than the sectors' peers.

We measure sustainable investment conditions by the extent of market preparedness for sustainable investment and the percent of total assets under management qualifying for sustainable investment with and without Shariah-compliance characteristics. We use both accounting and market-based performance measures to capture alternative influences due to sustainable investment conditions. We control for firm-specific characteristics and country-level sustainability-related, economic, and institutional factors. We find that higher market preparedness is positively associated with all performance measures, whilst sustainable investment volumes are negatively associated with accounting measures of firm performance but positively associated with market performance. The effects remain broadly robust to various sensitivity tests and endogeneity analyses. Country-level institutions moderate the sustainability conditions effect. Our dominance analysis identifies the factors that are key in improving firm performance, providing clear directions for effective policy intervention. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate governance; ESG; firm performance; institutions; MENA; Sustainable investment conditions","","H.

Starting with the early concerns in the 1960s about the world’s finite resources that would limit economic growth, sustainability thinking has expanded to encompass societal issues and ecological and environmental considerations in economic and governance activities. Governments and businesses need to act in tandem to address myriad world problems associated with climate change, pollution, environmental degradation, depleting resources, and the socio-economic disparities that characterize persistent world hunger and poverty. A vital aspect of this challenge is to stop or reverse unsustainable production and consumption that have hitherto been pursued as part of market-driven business activity. Marketing, through its market-driven consumption-oriented practices, may have knowingly or unknowingly promoted these unsustainable production-consumption practices. Therefore, it needs to change its orientation from merely being responsive to consumer and market needs into a more responsible approach that drives markets for sustainable products and services and builds sustainable societies. In this paper, we review how sustainable marketing considerations have grown but not to the extent of becoming the driver of markets and business practices that meet sustainability goals. To this end, we present a framework for driving sustainable consumption through corporate marketing strategy and relevant government interventions. We highlight four strategies of corporate marketing and four types of government intervention for sustainable marketing. © The Author(s) 2021.","ecological marketing; government intervention; green marketing; marketing strategy; responsible marketing; sustainability goals; sustainable consumption; sustainable development; sustainable marketing","","A.

Also, it further explored the conditions under which investing firms can encourage or discourage their CSR transparency. Our sample included 44,996 firm-year observations from 2004 to 2019 across 61 countries. Using a random-effects logistic model, our results indicate that corporate investments reduce firms’ CSR reporting and assurance tendency, which implies that a tradeoff exists between these two aspects of firm investment worldwide. Our moderation analysis outlined the contingent role of board-specific characteristics in the link between firm investment and CSR transparency. It appears that the CSR committee generates greater moderating effects on the firm investment–CSR transparency nexus than board monitoring and CEO duality.

The strategy evolution path of ESG enterprises is explored from the perspective of external regulation in the investment market. The evolutionary game analysis of ESG investment returns in five scenarios shows that the increase in reciprocal preferences of investors and ESG enterprises will promote enterprises to make high efforts to improve the quality of information disclosure and credit rating behavior. However, with the increase of project return, the degree of reciprocity of investors should be appropriately adjusted, otherwise it is easy to cause speculation of ESG enterprises. In the case of heterogeneous returns, the effects of positive and negative incentives differ greatly, so the incentive mechanism should be set to match the return state of ESG investments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","ESG investment; Evolutionary game; Incentive mechanism; Reciprocal preference","","Y.

Socially responsible collective action (SRCA) can be measured through intentions to take collective action (internal driving mechanisms) and behaviors to engage in collective action (external driving mechanisms). This research aims to develop and validate a network governance model to explore how SRCA, in the context of MWT projects, is enhanced. Data were collected from 365 respondents involved in MWT projects via an online survey. System dynamics (SD) was used to establish the system flow diagram model. Thereafter, Vensim PLE software was used to perform simulation and sensitivity analyses of the model. The results demonstrate that the network governance model explains how to enhance the SRCA of stakeholders in MWT projects. The main findings indicate that external driving mechanisms positively impact the SRCA during the entire project lifecycle, with values fluctuating around the initial level from the early to the mid-late stages, with small fluctuation. Internal driving mechanisms also positively impact SRCA, with values continuously increasing from the early to the mid-late stage. © Korean Society of Civil Engineers 2024.","External driving mechanisms; Internal driving mechanisms; Mega water transfer (MWT) projects; Network governance theory; Socially responsible collective action (SRCA)","Economic and social effects; System theory; Collective action; Driving mechanism; External driving; External driving mechanism; Internal driving mechanism; Mega water transfer  project; Network governance theory; Network governances; Socially responsible collective action; Water transfer projects; Sensitivity analysis","W.

To explore ways to efficiently enhance the sustainability of enterprises, this research, based on information asymmetry theory, investigates how EID affects CR, using data from China’s A-share-listed companies between 2011 and 2022. The study indicates that the effect of EID on CR was significantly positive at the 1% level. Mediation analysis suggests that this effect is facilitated by heightened investor attention and enhanced corporate innovation. Additionally, the positive impact is more pronounced for firms in high uncertainty environments, high levels of legalization, high levels of digital transformation, non-state-owned firms, small-scale firms, and firms in growth or decline. Based on this, EID is of great significance to enhance the resilience of enterprises, and policymakers, business managers, and investors should take into account their own development situation and the actual environment, and make scientific decisions according to local conditions. © 2025 by the authors.","corporate innovation; corporate resilience; digital transformation; environmental information disclosure; investor attention","China; asymmetry; business development; corporate strategy; digitization; innovation; sustainability; sustainable development","X.

This study finds that the implementation of the policy increases firms’ operating costs and leads to an increase in their financing constraints, which ultimately creates a disincentive for firms to take risks. Second, we also find that, relative to firms that do not disclose CSR reports, the sales revenues, R&D investment and investment levels of firms subject to CSR disclosure are significantly reduced, which may be the result of firms’ tendency to operate conservatively. In addition, heterogeneity analyses suggest that the dampening effect of mandatory CSR disclosure policies on risk-taking is stronger for firms with higher financing costs and for non-state-owned firms.

The panel data model indicated a strong relationship between the reporting status of a business entity, its revenue, and the time variable, demonstrating that the likelihood of providing information on energy transition was associated with the size of a company and increased systemically over time. However, further regression analysis revealed a lack of a persistent, significant relationship between the key financial indicators and the entities’ energy transition reporting status. Considering the substantial changes in the EU regulatory environment associated with introducing CSRD, we conclude that with increasing legal pressure over time, companies will gradually shift towards standardized industry-related reporting practices, resulting in more consistent and transparent evidence of their energy transition strategies. © 2024 by the author.","agri-food sector; CSRD; efficiency; energy transition; ESRS","Agribusiness; Food industry; Agri-food sector; Business entities; Corporates; CSRD; Energy transitions; ESRS; European companies; Financial indicator; Food sector; Research papers; Agri-food","S.

This study aims to investigate the correlation between the disclosure of cybersecurity practices and the performance of companies within the Australian S&P/ASX 300 index spanning the period from 2010 to 2020. To analyze this connection, the generalized method of moments (GMM) technique was employed on the panel dataset of 2376 observations to address potential endogeneity issues identified in the initial findings. Our results indicate a positive impact on both accounting and market-based performance metrics due to increased corporate cybersecurity disclosure. Consequently, broadening the range of disclosed cyber-related information enhances companies' performance by furnishing valuable insights to stakeholders. The findings underscore the significance and reach of cybersecurity disclosure, affirming that meeting stakeholder expectations through the divulgence of cybersecurity information yields financial advantages and increases company performance. Furthermore, heightened transparency in cybersecurity matters mitigates information asymmetry, curtails agency problems, and reduces associated costs. Consequently, the disclosure of cybersecurity practices and incidents emerges as a strategic avenue for companies to bolster corporate well-being in the future, fostering transparency, building trust with stakeholders, and potentially augmenting revenue. In light of these findings, it is increasingly imperative for companies to prioritize cybersecurity and proactively disclose their cybersecurity practices and incidents. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands out as one of the limited inquiries examining the impact of cybersecurity disclosure on company performance, specifically within the Australian context. The insights derived from this research carry significance for regulators, policymakers, investors, lenders, and a diverse array of stakeholders. By shedding light on the crucial role of cybersecurity disclosure practices, this study offers valuable guidance for these entities in understanding the pivotal connection between such disclosures and a company's ability to attain its financial objectives. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, its externalities may inhibit the proactive involvement of firms in such initiatives. In this study, we examined the roles of two types of managerial ties (i.e., business and political) in green innovation and further investigated the moderating effects of two types of contextual factors (i.e., environmental regulations and competitive intensity). By conducting an empirical study using survey data from 218 samples, we confirm that business ties positively affect green innovation while political ties have an inverted U-shaped effect. Moreover, the relationship between managerial ties and green innovation is contingent on specific context settings. Our results show that the environmental regulations enforced by the government strengthen both the effects of business and political ties, while the competitive intensity has no effect on the relationship between business ties and green innovation; however, it sharpens the curvilinear effect of political ties. © 2022 by the authors.

However, empirical evidence regarding the effect of DT on sustainable development performance (SDP) is mixed, and the boundary conditions merit further investigation. Drawing upon organizational information processing theory, this research examines the influence of DT on SDP, specifically focusing on economic sustainability and environmental and social (E&S) sustainability. We also delve deep into the moderating role of top management team (TMT) faultlines (relationship-related faultlines and task-related faultlines). This research comprises an analysis of data collected from Chinese manufacturing firms spanning the period 2012–2021. The empirical results reveal that DT can positively affect E&S sustainability but negatively impact economic sustainability. TMT faultlines play a dual role in this association, with TMT relationship-related faultlines exacerbating the negative effects of DT on economic sustainability, and TMT task-related faultlines enhancing the positive impacts of DT on E&S sustainability, as well as mitigating the digitalization paradox. In addition, our results do not support the notion that TMT relationship-related faultlines moderate the relationship between DT and E&S sustainability. This research contributes to the digitalization paradox and faultline literature by highlighting the distinct moderation mechanisms of TMT faultlines.

The academic world has widely discussed the relationship between environmental information disclosure and the economic performance of enterprises, but how the heterogeneity of environmental information disclosure methods affects the enterprise value has not been explored. This paper aims to answer two questions: (1) what is the impact of Ecomark and ESG on enterprise value? and (2) how does the interaction between Ecomark and ESG influence enterprise value? Utilizing the listed Japanese electrical equipment manufacturing enterprises dataset from 2008 to 2021, we employed the fixed panel linear regression model to confirm the relationship between Ecomark and ESG in enterprise value, and further used a moderating effect model to verify the existence of the crowd-out effect of ESG performance on Ecomark through enterprise value. In addition, a robustness check scheme was designed and performed to test the model settings, outliers and endogeneity issues. The main findings show that the obtaining of Ecomark certification and good ESG performance can help to improve enterprise value, but they may be altered regarding the heterogeneity of environmental information disclosure methods, further causing differences in enterprises’ time and economic cost burdens. Such differences increase the attractiveness of ESGs to investors, thereby crowding out the impact of Ecomark on enterprise value. Our conclusion reveals the mechanism of the heterogeneity of environmental information disclosure methods towards enterprise value, which offers a valuable reference for investors to evaluate enterprise value and paves the way for enterprise decision-makers and authorities to optimize their environmental information disclosure. © 2023 by the authors.","Ecomark; enterprise value; ESG; Japan; product life cycle","Japan; cost analysis; data set; environmental economics; industrial enterprise; industrial performance; life cycle analysis; manufacturing","Y.

In a pioneering analysis, we delve into the nuanced interplay between CSR assurance, female directors and environmental and social disclosures. Intriguingly, our findings reveal a negative and significant interaction between female directors and CSR assurance, shedding light on potential substitutes in shaping environmental and social disclosures. Furthermore, our study uncovers the moderating effect of sensitive industries, indicating a positive relationship between CSR assurance and environmental disclosures. Importantly, these insights remain robust across alternative estimation approaches. This study marks a notable contribution by being the first to scrutinize the implications of CSR assurance on social disclosure, investigate the substitutive role of female directors in comparison with CSR assurance and shed light on the added significance of CSR assurance in firms operating in sensitive industries. Our findings provide valuable insights for corporations and stakeholders amid escalating demands for comprehensive and reliable reporting on environmental and social matters. Likewise, this study underscores the potential policy implications of promoting or mandating CSR assurance, given its positive impact on environmental and social disclosures.

The aim of the research is to analyze the relationships between digitization in the industry, artificial intelligence, and performance in the design, production, and use of construction products in the context of Industry 4.0 principles. The research uses primary and secondary data on the use of AI and its potential and impacts in the field of performance and efficiency in design, production, and use in civil engineering. Several statistical tools are used in the analysis, from descriptive statistics to the use of statistical tests and correlation and regression analysis. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was the primary tool for evaluating the dependence between variables. The research results point to the connection and dependence between the use of AI and digitization in individual design and production activities. Autonomous production machines, the production of ore products, and generative design represent areas of production in the construction industry, where the use of AI and digitization makes sense from the point of view of the performance of the results. Innovations and intelligent tools within the concept of Industry 4.0 (Construction 4.0) are, therefore, a prerequisite for an effective setting of design and production in this industry as well. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; civil engineering products; Industry 4.0; information modeling; information systems; manufacturing; sustainable design","","A.

We contribute to the body of knowledge in the associated fields of socially responsible investment, sustainable investing and industrial sustainability in four ways: (1) identifying the most influential articles in the field, (2) mapping the interdisciplinary character of socially responsible investing and its bibliometric similarity to adjacent fields, (3) visualising nature and trends of the research field via network analysis, and by (4) synthesising areas for further research. While socially responsible investing has gained considerable traction already, there is to date no holistic bibliometric analysis on the topic. This is the research gap this paper addresses and helps to close.

Balancing economic goals with eco-friendly initiatives is pivotal in today's business landscape. This study investigates the intricate relationship between ERs, and firms’ environmental investments, focusing on the nuances of command-based and market-based ERs. With the backdrop of China's rapid economic growth and its subsequent environmental challenges, this research aims to shed light on how ERs influence firms’ environmental investments and innovative practices while considering the role of Financial Constraints (FCs). The study empirically examines the interplay of these factors using a comprehensive dataset of listed companies in China. The study utilizes 750 observations from the China Environmental Statistical Yearbook (2019-2020) and investigates the relationship between ER, finance, and firm environmental (FE) investments in diverse Chinese industries and regions. The study utilized diverse statistical methods, baseline, mediating effect, robustness tests, and linear regression to analyze China's environmental data, emphasizing descriptive analysis. The theoretical contribution of this study is that highlighting regulatory pressure fosters financial gains, driving firms to invest in environmental initiatives for long-term profitability proactively. These findings underscore the significance of taking into financial dynamics while creating and implementing ER. Policymakers should focus on mechanisms that enhance firms’ access to funding, such as promoting transparency through environmental and social responsibility reporting. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Command-based regulations; environmental investments; environmental regulations; financial constraints; innovation; market-based regulations","","Y.

While companies must engage in greener operations, they also need to juggle their financial performance. Companies need guides on allocating their limited resources to embed green practices and achieve competitive advantage. Academic studies, thus far, have overlooked this. This study aims to fill the gap by studying companies’ green value chain profiles with different competitive advantage attainments. The 207 companies that responded to the survey are classified into four clusters based on their level of competitive advantage: no competitive advantage (cluster 1), only efficiency advantage (cluster 2), only value advantage (cluster 3), and both efficiency and value advantage (cluster 4). The results of variance analysis showed significant differences in eight out of nine value chain activities across the clusters, except green marketing and sales. Companies with competitive advantages demonstrate greater commitment to green activities, especially those from the value advantage-only and both competitive advantage groups. Between them, they embed green initiatives in different value chain activities. Interestingly, green marketing and sales is the only activity with no significant difference among the four clusters of companies, yet they committed the highest green initiatives to this activity. While this study reaffirms the positive impact of companies’ commitment to green initiatives on achieving competitive advantage, companies need to carefully strategize their level of commitment to green initiatives based on the competitive advantage they pursue. © The Author(s) 2024.","competitive advantage; green profiles; green value chain; Porter’s; value chain analysis","","W.

However, the adoption of FinTech often faces tough barriers in the context of India. Therefore, this study's objective is to identify such key barriers and analyze their interrelationships and cause/effect classification. The identified FinTech adoption barriers have been determined through a systematic literature review, and the key barriers were finalized based on the expert's inputs. After that, the integrated Fuzzy hybrid methodology was used to understand the in-depth relationships among these barriers. This study's findings confirmed that the lack of government regulation in combination with safety and reliability issues are the major challenging barriers. This study should help practitioners, and policymakers involved in the financial infrastructure development field to tackle barriers in an optimized manner for accelerated FinTech adoption.

A common recyclable waste stream associated with urban living is waste glass, which typically comes from packaging or product containers. Although most of this stream can be reused and/or recycled, it is worth exploring alternative uses, especially for areas with high fluctuations in waste glass production. An example would be the sudden increase in waste glass in tourist areas during the high season. To this end, the present work presents the results from the life cycle assessment of waste glass geopolymerization for the production of cement tiles. The methodology includes the estimation of mass and energy balances by dividing the whole process into several sub-processes (NaOH addition, energy consumption, etc.). The NaOH addition was found to be the most burden-intensive process, with a total damage of 9 × 10−5 DALY per ton of waste glass in the human health category, while a minor contribution in all damage categories was attributed to process electricity demands (7.7 to 19.4%). By comparing the geopolymerization process with conventional recycling, an environmental benefit of 20 mPt and 26 kg CO2 per ton of waste glass was demonstrated, indicating the process’s expediency. The present study is a valuable tool for the up-scaling of processes towards a circular economy. © 2025 by the authors.","construction materials; geopolymerization; life cycle assessment; recycling; waste glass","Life cycle assessment; Conventional materials; Environmentally friendly products; Geopolymerization; Glass production; Glasses In; Recyclable wastes; Recycled materials; Sustainable construction; Waste glass; Waste stream; Circular economy","M.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors did a meta-analysis of the reviewed literature taken from peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the time frame of 1985-2016. Methodology used by the authors is through preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Findings: Corporate sustainability is a well-practiced area in big organisations. However, literature suggests that in case of SMEs, the situation is different. Social and environmental practices are grossly neglected in SMEs, more specifically in emerging markets. Existing literature mentions that collaborative mode of operation, government policy and facilitation and supporting organisation culture can positively influence SME’s sustainability performance and hence improve their financial performance. Research limitations/implications: Most of the papers in corporate sustainability literature are qualitative in nature and there is no empirical evidence of establishing this relationship in SME context. This paper tries to conceptualise the existence of a possible framework relating factors of sustainability and their role in improving business performance of the SMEs. However, the findings are purely literature-based and piloting of the questionnaire is also done on 20 SMEs in a specific geography. This is a very small and also a biased sample. Future research studies based on this paper are expected to verify the proposed relationship with larger data set catering to different industry clusters and countries. Practical implications: The proposed model is only directional in nature. With the content analysis, the authors have tried to answer the research questions relating to factors of sustainability and its impact on business performance. To address the research questions in a more generalised way, an empirical research needs to be conducted to establish the research propositions. The proposed model needs to be validated and optimised with further research and data analysis. Once such a model is established, this can be proved beneficial for providing guidance to SMEs to enhance the sustainability of their business operations. Social implications: The SME sector has made a significant contribution to the economic development in countries, and this sector has huge potential for growth, and their geographic spread and penetration is much higher than large organisations. Sustainable growth of this industry sector can reasonably be expected to lead to stable and sustainable development of the nation. Moreover, environmental and social best practices adopted by SMEs will also have a positive influence on society and environment in the long run. Originality/value: This paper had done a geography wise analysis of sustainable practices in SMEs, and based on the recommendations and suggestions of different analyses, the authors developed few research propositions and also presented a conceptual model. Finally, to address the gap, it mentions some future research possibilities to test and validate the proposed model in the context of SMEs in emerging markets of Asia. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; Small and medium enterprises","","M.

In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 649 articles published between 2007 and 2022, as well as a systematic literature review of 81 articles, to assess the extent to which the CE and BE communities have addressed the SDGs. Our analysis identified 10 research gaps including the limited number of empirical quantitative papers, particularly in the context of BE, and the underrepresentation of developing regions such as Latin America and Africa in the literature. Our main finding reveals that the CE community primarily focuses on SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production, followed by SDG 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy; and SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation. The BE community, on the other hand, focuses primarily on SDG 7, followed by SDG 9 and SDG 12. However, both communities lack attention to social SDGs such as quality education, poverty, and gender equality. We propose that a combination of CE and BE, known as circular bioeconomy, could help countries achieve all SDGs. Further research is needed to develop and implement circular bioeconomy policies that address these gaps and promote sustainable development. In this sense, our study identified an important research gap that needs more attention in the future. © 2023, The Author(s).","Bibliometrics; Circular bioeconomy (CBE); Global agenda; Sustainability; Sustainable development agenda; United Nations (UN)","","D.

Given the social commentary on enterprise strategic arrangements in relation to environmental protection, green investment, labour rights, and the global concern over CSR, this study integrates a firm’s prospective CSR, innovation, and operating performance into a conceptual framework, taking firms in Taiwan’s technology and manufacturing industry as its survey target. Structural equational modelling is adopted in this research to analyse the response data (n = 230) by applying stakeholder theory, the value chain concept, and the resource-based view. The test results of the conceptual model show that internal CSR, external CSR, and environmental and social CSR benefit firms’ innovation performance through different levels of influence. The effects of CSR initiatives on firm operating performance vary, mediated by the degree of innovation. The importance of knowledge management (KM) related to CSR is identified and explored in this study. KM helps generate innovation and sustainability through distinct integrative CSR implementation practices. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Corporate social responsibility; external CSR; innovation; internal CSR","Taiwan; corporate social responsibility; green economy; innovation; labor policy; manufacturing; sustainability","T.-Y.

We estimate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic implications from electrifying gate operations for 2354 commercial-traffic airports in the world. Here we show that complete electrification could yield GHG reductions of 63%-97% per gate operation relative to current practice, with greater reductions correlated with low-carbon electricity. Economic payback periods average just 1-2 years. Shifting to complete gate electrification could save a high-traffic airport an average of $5-6 million in annual climate economic damages relative to estimates of current practice. 10-12 million metric tons of annual GHG emissions are potentially saved if most airports in the world electrified gate operations, costing the 24 busiest global airports on average $25-30, U.S. airports $60-70, and non-U.S. airports $80-90 per metric ton of CO2 mitigated, in some cases comparable to carbon-market prices.

Consequently, improving sustainability performance has become a critical priority. This study fills a significant research gap by examining the relationships between external environmental factors, organizational sustainable culture, and sustainable performance. Importantly, this study investigates the mediating role of organizational culture between external environmental factors (customer pressure, regulatory pressure, government support, environmental uncertainty) and green performance. Questionnaire data from 214 personnel from manufacturing organizations in China were collected, and Smart PLS 4.0 was used for analysis. The results reveal that all external environmental factors significantly influence organizational culture. In addition, the organizational culture significantly mediates the relationships between external environmental factors and green performance. This study contributes to understanding how external factors shape organizational culture, subsequently influencing sustainable performance. This study offers a new perspective on the indirect role corporate culture plays in environmental outcomes. Policymakers and managers should foster a sustainable work culture to address external demands for green performance. © 2025 by the authors.","China; external environmental factors; green performance; organizational culture; sustainability","China; environmental factor; industrial performance; manufacturing; planning method; questionnaire survey; state role; sustainability","D.

In this paper, Eurostat datasets were analyzed to uncover trends in SME digitalization and sustainability, focusing on patterns in data utilization, employee training, and environmental considerations. These insights were integrated into an altered Ecocanvas sustainability modeling tool to develop a framework supporting their strategic planning and decision-making. It has proven to be a useful tool for this purpose by mapping business processes against sustainability and strategic goals while indicating where digital or alternative solutions can be introduced. SMEs analyze data and consider environmental impacts at different levels based on their size categories.

This study fills an important gap by analyzing the framework of CSR assessment practices on identification of five criteria and 17 indicators encompassing the strategies of accountability, transparency and compliance of CSR. To achieve the goal of CSR, the strategies have been defined in connection with different literatures and quaternary survey for criteria selection, where the criteria are expressed in a fuzzy horizon. This multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model has been solved using a fuzzy analytical networking process and balanced scorecard (BSC) method to develop selection strategy and criteria for implementation of CSR. The paper's outcomes help administrators of corporate sectors, particularly in developing countries, to follow sustainable actions as CSR providers effectively and to gain a significant reasonable advantage. The findings exposed the CSR assessment structure and interrelationships among BSC perspectives/criteria and indicators on which managers are needed to emphasize to get optimum CSR performance. In this study, the most important strategy and criteria to perform optimum CSR level are as follows: ""accountability of CSR project"" is the best strategy; ""Project team work, incentives, Environmental resources, Communication for motivation, Reporting initiative of stockholders, CSR project with stockholder capital, Strategic governance, Mission sustainability, political role, Human resources"", respectively, are criteria. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","balanced scorecard (BSC); Corporate social responsibility (CSR); criteria; fuzzy analytical networking process (F-ANP); strategy","","S.

Women representation on corporate boards is among the most debated topics, and several legislative measures have recently been adopted to improve gender equality in boards. However, real progress requires firms to appoint women on boards not just as a matter of compliance. Thus, assessing the business implications of board gender diversity can support the adoption of new policies and prevent their reduction to mere tokenism. By applying a dynamic literature review method called ‘Systematic Literature Network Analysis’, this study provides an overview of the existing literature investigating the impact of board gender diversity on companies' level and quality of disclosure. Overall, researchers report a positive relationship. Some notable exceptions nevertheless call for further research to deepen our understanding of how enhanced gender equality in boards can improve corporate communication and transparency. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","board gender diversity; disclosure; literature review; SLNA; voluntary disclosure; women directors","","A.

Hence, the objective of this study is twofold: (1) to test whether a board structure is associated with firm financial and CSR performance and (2) whether the CSR committee and CEO duality moderates this association in the healthcare sector. Examining the moderation of CSR committee is important to understand whether CSR committee strengthens or weakens the link between female directors and CSR performance. Moreover, CEO duality's moderation will highlight whether powerful CEOs are a barrier for female directors' monitoring role. The data for the study was derived from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the years between 2011–2018. Overall, the results suggest that while female directors contribute to firm performance, CEOs with dual roles and larger boards harm firm performance. Further, independent directors have a limited contribution to CSR performance whereas they have no contribution to financial performance. Moderation analysis shows that CSR committees and female directors are not the replacement of one another; they are both needed and beneficial to the corporate structure. Although CEOs with a dual role impair the performance of a firm, they do not exert considerable influence on the other directors. As one of the important functions of a board is monitoring, these findings assist healthcare firms to configure their boards to improve their monitoring functions. The results are therefore helpful in terms of alleviating agency costs and in appeasing stakeholders. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","board structure; CEO duality; CSR committee; CSR performance; financial performance; healthcare; stakeholder theory; sustainable development","","A.

The study also explores the moderation of ecologically conscious consumer behavior (ECCB) on the multiplicative effect of brand awareness (BAw), brand association (BA) and perceived quality (PQ) in influencing the BI. Design/methodology/approach: Responses from 393 Indian ridesharing users were collected using judgmental sampling and were analyzed using Hayes Process macro. Findings: The study found a direct relationship between BAw and BI, BAw and BA, BAw and PQ, BA and PQ, PQ and BI, and BA and BI. Findings revealed mediation of BA in BAw and BI relationship and PQ in BAw and BI relationship. Results revealed that BA and PQ serially mediate BAw and BI relationship. ECCB moderates PQ and BI relationship but not BAw and BI relationship. Research limitations/implications: Serial mediation and moderated-mediation results draw various theoretical implications for determinants of Aaker's Brand Equity model and ECCB. Practical implications: The research has several implications for managers in view of brand equity determinants and ECCB. The study also contributes to policy implications.

Data on A-share listed companies from the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2020 was collected from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research Database (CSMAR). The results of the SPSS analysis confirmed the significant positive correlation between enterprise innovation and environmental performance. From the perspective of internal governance, a larger board size strengthens the effect of enterprise innovation on environmental performance, which is consistent with the arguments of other scholars. However, when it comes to the proportion of independent directors, the opposite situation is presented. The results showed that companies with a smaller proportion of independent directors are more conducive for eliciting environmental performance from innovation. The conclusions of this paper do not only validate the positive impact of enterprise innovation on environmental performance, but also supplement the literature on the moderating role of internal corporate governance systems on this relationship in the Chinese context. The findings offer suggestions and support for enterprises to positively influence the environment when carrying out innovation activities and provide a reference for the country to implement green governance in enterprises as well as to formulate corresponding policies. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

Empirical analyses are conducted using DCC-FIGARCH, FIGARCH and Quantile VAR models with consideration for results of various long memory (Hurst exponent) tests. The FIGARCH modeling for mean and variance equations indicates that five cryptocurrency sectors (Logistics, Entertainment, Gaming, Metaverse and NFT) possess a relatively weak but consistent relationship with global sustainability. These sectors appear to be positively and negatively impacting the returns and volatilities of global sustainability, respectively. Additionally, the QVAR model indicates that global sustainability and respective cryptocurrency indices mainly interact during upward market trends. According to the results, utilizing blockchain technology in traditional markets may offer promising outcomes for global sustainability. The findings are encouraging for the future practices of this technology in traditional sectors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology; Cryptocurrency markets; Global sustainability","Electronic money; Sustainable development; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Business models; Cryptocurrency market; Empirical analysis; FIGARCH; Global sustainability; Long memory; Performance indices; VAR models; Blockchain","S.

Additionally, they are becoming an essential factor in attracting migrants. This article aims to determine the impact of foreign direct investment on global migration trends and their peculiarities with the introduction of ESG investment principles. For this purpose, global foreign direct investment flows, global ESG investment flows, and global migration trends have been analyzed from 1995 to 2022. Pairwise correlation calculation was used as the primary analysis method through R-Studio software with integrated R programming language. The results indicated a 35% correlation between the volume of global ESG investment flows and the number of international migrants (as a percentage of the total population, which varies between 3.2% and 3.6%) for 2010-2022. Subsequently, regression analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between critical variables: investment flows and the level of migration in four European countries (France, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany). It was determined that investment inflows led to new jobs, accelerated economic growth, and improved business climate, thus encouraging reduced outflow and increased inflow of migrants. Investments based on ESG principles also reduce emigration as they enhance the quality of life in the host country, provide better environmental protection, and promote more transparent corporate management. However, it should be noted that investments have no apparent impact on migration caused by external factors such as wars or political conflicts, so such analysis should not include periods of global economic and political unrest. © 2024, Centre of Sociological Research.

This study investigates the relationship between digital technologies, digital organizational culture (DOC), environmental dynamism and EP through the mediation of innovation capacity (IC) and moderation of perceived environmental volatility and green strategic intent (GSI). Design/methodology/approach: The data were gathered from 473 managers of manufacturing SMEs in Pakistan. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to examine the mediation and moderation effects. Multiple regression analysis was used to see the influence of digital technologies, DOC, environmental dynamism, innovation capacity, perceived environmental volatility and GSI on SMEs environmental performance. Findings: Results indicate a statistically significant direct relationship between digital technologies, environmental dynamism and EP. While there is an insignificant direct relationship between DOC and EP. Furthermore, the results reported a significant result between digital technologies, DOC, environmental dynamism and IC. Similarly, IC significantly mediated the relationship between digital technologies, DOC, environmental dynamism and EP. Moreover, results reported that perceived environmental volatility does not moderate the relationship between IC and EP, while GSI significantly moderates between IC and EP. Practical implications: Policymakers must emphasize advancing digital integration to enhance manufacturing SMEs’ efficiency and environmental effectiveness. Originality/value: This is the first research that incorporates digital technologies, environmental factors and innovation capacity to measure environmental performance in line of natural resource orchestration theory (natural ROT). All the variables significantly measure environmental performance instead of digital organizational culture.

In this study, I explicate why bad news about firms’ corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR) can be good news for firms. Specifically, I address the role of negative media coverage of CSiR in firms’ corporate social performance (CSP). Drawing on signaling theory, I propose that negative media coverage of CSiR is a form of costly yet effective external feedback to firms’ current social signaling. It, therefore, propels firms to undertake organizational changes to send positive response signals through improved CSP. Furthermore, I argue that this effect is augmented by organizational innovation search, which influences firms’ learning capacity required to improve firms’ CSP. Using a multicountry sample of 1,049 firms between 2007 and 2016, I find that negative media coverage of CSiR induces firms to enhance CSP, and this effect is moderated by organizational innovation search. © The Author(s) 2022.","corporate social performance (CSP); corporate social responsibility (CSR), innovation search; nonfinancial disclosure; R&D; signaling theory","corporate social responsibility; firm size; innovation; organizational framework; research and development","L.

Therefore, this paper examines the correlation between carbon emission reduction and financial performance in energy firms. Design/Methodology/Approach: A two-way fixed-effects model is developed using data from 33 Chinese energy-listed companies between 2015 and 2020. Findings: The benchmark regression results show that improving a company's carbon emission reduction performance leads to better financial performance. Moreover, assuming corporate responsibility for reducing emissions can boost companies' reputations and foster better relationships with stakeholders. The trustworthiness of the standard regression outcome is validated through alternative independent variables, reducing time frames, and incorporating previously omitted factors. The results of heterogeneity analyses show that reducing carbon emissions has the same effect on financial performance across all regional characteristics and equity subgroups. Furthermore, the internal transmission mechanism analysis reveals that female leadership positively moderates the effect, while financing constraints negatively moderate the relationship between carbon emission reduction performance and financial performance. Conclusion: Under the national green development strategy of achieving carbon neutrality and carbon peaking, the carbon information disclosure system should be improved by the government; enterprises should implement innovative methods for low-carbon economic management and operation; and regulators should establish effective green regulations, incentives, and constraints. This paper offers a comprehensive guide for energy companies and their stakeholders to reduce carbon emissions, thereby achieving sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.","Carbon emission reduction performance; Female leadership; financial performance; Financing constraints; Heterogeneity analysis; Moderating effect; Two-way fixed effects model","","X.

Advanced technologies are often used to enhance team outcomes for improved productivity and to create effective knowledge-sharing contexts in teams, particularly in contexts where trust among team members is vital. This study analyzed the influence of knowledge sharing on trust at the team level in Kenya. The objective was to determinepractical implications to assist organizations with their efforts to optimize the association between knowledge sharing and team-level trust and to consider the moderating role of collaborative technology on this relationship. Data were collected from 300 professional employees at three organizations in Kenya, aggregated into 75 teams, and analyzed in a hierarchical multiple linear regression. The team-level analysis found that knowledge sharing was significantly and positively related to the extent of team trust, and the relationship was moderated by the perception of collaborative technology. Organizations should consider their teams' knowledge sharing and trust to support team dynamics and achieve organizational and team goals. Employees' perceptions that technologies support team processes influence the effectiveness of knowledge sharing as a way to build team trust. © 2020 by the authors.","Collaborative technology; Knowledge sharing; Social exchange theory; Trust","Kenya; knowledge based system; participatory approach; perception; technological development; technology adoption; technology transfer","S.-W.

The results show that environmental innovation has a positive impact on market value, but this relationship is partially mediated by legitimacy. Although firms tend to not consider environmental innovation as a conventional source of competitive advantage and financial returns, our findings indicate that managers of industrial firms should focus their operations on developing environmental innovations to attain legitimacy in industries that are stigmatized by high pollution levels. In turn, environmental legitimacy will not only shield the firm from the industry's mounting institutional pressures but also lead to higher market valuation. © 2021","Environmental innovation; Environmental legitimacy; Market value; Polluting industries","","Y.

This study highlights the personal ethics of TMs, so as to examine the moderating effect of TMs' place attachment on SMEs' pro-environmental operations. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical data are collected from a questionnaire survey of 509 SMEs in China. Hierarchical regression results are subject to cross-validation using secondary public data. Findings: This study demonstrates that coercive and mimetic pressures have inverted U-shaped effects, whilst normative pressure has a U-shaped effect on the threat cognition of TMs. The results also show that TMs' threat cognition (as opposed to opportunity cognition) positively influences SMEs' pro-environmental operations. Moreover, both the emotional (place identity) and functional (place dependence) dimensions of place attachment have positive moderating effects on the relationship between threat cognition and SMEs' pro-environmental operations. Practical implications: Findings of this study lead to important implications for practitioners such as regulators, policy makers and trade associations. Enabling better understanding of the nature of SMEs' pro-environmental operations, they allow for more targeted development and the provision of optimal institutional tools to promote such operations. Originality/value: This study allows some important factors that differentiate SMEs from large firms to surface. These factors (i.e. institutional pressures, managerial cognition and place attachment) and the interactions between them form important constituents of the microfoundations of SMEs' pro-environmental operations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Institutional pressure; Managerial cognition; Place attachment; Pro-environmental operations; SME","","Q.

Based on the 2015 ESG ratings of SynTao Green Finance as a quasi-natural experiment and based on the panel data of China's A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this study deeply explores the impact of ESG ratings on the continuous innovation ability of enterprises by constructing a multi-temporal double-difference model and a triple-difference model. The results show that ESG ratings can significantly enhance firms’ continuous innovation ability, a conclusion supported by a series of robustness tests. The positive impact of ESG ratings is more prominent for firms with low market attention, state-owned enterprises, and firms with high digital transformation. The impact mechanism suggests that ESG ratings advance firms’ ability to continuously innovate by increasing employment, improving employee income, and enhancing firm value. It is further found that ESG ratings are more effective in enhancing the continuous innovation ability of heavy polluters and capital–and technology-intensive firms than other firms.

Therefore, the main goal is to analyze whether qualified staff and investment in technology affect the sustainability of profit in businesses through the investigation of accounting factors in the audited financial statements toward a circular economy, more specifically in these financial items: total assets (TASS), and intangible assets (IASS), total liabilities (TLIA), total income (TREV), and net financial income (NFI), based on questions about which financial items businesses should take care of, as well as businesses that do not invest in technologies and skilled staff: does this hinder profit sustainability? Therefore, for this study, data are collected from the financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) of (N = 800) businesses according to their activity (manufacturing businesses = 256, service businesses = 192, and distribution businesses = 353) during the period (2020–2022). The results show that each of the variables and factors had a significant impact on sustainable profit through the circular economy in (N = 800) businesses. However, to have a sustainable profit in business, it is strongly recommended to pay attention to these findings: businesses should (a) be careful with total liabilities, (b) increase the performance of total assets, (c) increase the performance of net financial income, (d) increase the performance of total business income, and (e) increase and develop the skills of workers, as well as improve technology (equipment, machinery, etc.). With implications and limitations, it was difficult to access some of the financial statements; there are only a limited number of variables, so the same models can be analyzed for other businesses, variables, and countries. © 2023 by the authors.","accounting; auditing; businesses; circular economy; financial statements; sustainable profit","","E.

A total of 225 papers were found through the search criteria, out of which 213 papers were selected for review. The paper identifies gaps in the literature that can be considered as opportunities for future study. The analysis of these articles led us to note the need for an agenda that can present a holistic framework of sustainable investment with lesser variations and increased acceptability. The research agenda proposed by the paper may help researchers in framing their research problems around the gaps identified. Sustainable investment is a potential solution to social and ecological issues by transforming the financial markets to have more accountability for their impacts.

A synergy versus trade-off dilemma on the R&D–CSR relationship has emerged as an important topic in the literature. The synergy approach suggests a positive link between R&D and CSR, whereas the trade-off approach suggests a negative link. The authors employ the resource-, institution-, and industry-based views to clarify this dilemma by examining two moderators at the country and industry levels. The authors envision that home-country national philanthropic environment (NPE) influences whether managers should take synergy or trade-off approach because NPE reflects the institutional pressures for firms to be more philanthropic. Further, because research finds that CSR differs between manufacturing and service firms, this industry categorization is hypothesized to moderate the effects of NPE on the R&D–CSR relationship. Estimating a hierarchical linear model with a sample of 888 firms across 15 countries, the authors show that in high-NPE countries, there is an R&D–CSR synergy, and in low-NPE countries, there is a trade-off. Furthermore, these relationships are relevant only within service industries rather than manufacturing industries. © American Marketing Association 2021.","corporate social responsibility; industry; institutions; philanthropy; research and development","","A.A.

Driven by consumer interest in low-carbon products, regulatory requirements, and investor priorities, companies are pressured to integrate sustainability beyond short-term financial gains. The growing awareness of the environmental impact of business models (BM) has fueled the development of Sustainable Business Models (SBMs). Although the importance of decarbonization of EIMIs has increased, there is a lack of industry-specific research examining the combination of decarbonization and business models, as well as their interrelationships and correlations. This study addresses the discussion on the role of SBMs in decarbonization, improving the understanding of how these drivers can be integrated to enable new BMs for EIMIs. Based on a structured literature review and semi-structured interviews within the EIMIs, the study identifies BM components influenced by these drivers requiring sustainable business model innovation (SBMI). Results show that decarbonization drivers significantly impact all BM components. Experts emphasize the importance of collaborative approaches and cooperation throughout the value chain. This research highlights the need for systematic analysis to understand how companies can manage decarbonization drivers effectively and suggests exploring potential SBM design options. © 2024 by the authors.","business model; business model innovation; decarbonization; survey; sustainable transformation","France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; business development; environmental impact; innovation; literature review; manufacturing; sustainability","F.

First, we hypothesize that the relationship between CSR and brand value obtains across major world regions and industrial sectors (“the convergence thesis”). Second, we hypothesize that the relationship has weakened with time, as companies have had increasing difficulty using CSR to differentiate their brands in a sea of CSR-espousing competitors (“the crowding out thesis”). Third, we hypothesize that the relationship between CSR and brand value is weaker where a brand’s identity is different from that of its corporate owner, which may make it difficult for observers to readily link (corporate-level) CSR with its potential (lower level) brand beneficiaries (“the identity-match thesis”). We support these hypotheses with random-effects, fixed-effects, and instrumental-variable regressions before ending with contributions, limitations, implications, and potential next steps. © The Author(s) 2021.","brand architecture; Brand Finance; brand identity; brand value; corporate social responsibility; explicit CSR","","S.

Methodologically, this research develops a systematic literature review based on papers published in the Web of Science database in the last ten years. As a result, there was an upward evolution of research on the searched topic, with one hundred fifteen publications in the last three years compared to one hundred six documents published in the previous seven years. It is also observed that studies published at the beginning of the time frame between 2011 and 2020 were more concerned with the adoption of corporate sustainability, while the most recent research focuses on new approaches and methodologies for its implementation. And, with regard to its implementation, one of the main barriers is the incorrect perception of senior managers that the results from corporate sustainability must be more linked to the economic than to the environmental and social spheres. As relevant aspects, this study observed that new technologies, currently led by the 5th generation mobile network (5G) and Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), can contribute to the insertion of corporate sustainability in the industrial context. It also noted that, despite being recent, COVID-19 was considered by several researchers as an event to be considered in terms of corporate sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Corporate sustainability; Environment; Social performance; Social responsibility; Sustainable development; Triple bottom line","corporate strategy; database; environmental technology; future prospect; industrial development; innovation; literature review; perception; sustainability; sustainable development","U.R. de Oliveira; Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Volta Redonda, 783 Desembargador Ellis Hermydio Figueira St, Rio de Janeiro, 27213-145, Brazil; email: ualison.oliveira@gmail.com","English","Environ.

The empirical results indicate that media attention consistently and significantly enhances corporate environmental governance. This effect remains robust across endogeneity considerations and alternative tests. Additionally, in regions with higher marketization and stronger rule of law frameworks, the efficacy of media attention in improving corporate environmental performance becomes remarkably pronounced. Further analysis unveils that media attention positively impacts environmental governance by elevating public awareness, refining internal management efficiency, and fostering innovative strategies for minimizing environmental impact.

Globally, accounting standards and guidance are emerging but these are yet to provide the level of clarity required by the business and accounting profession on the uncertainty of future climate and how this can compromise some long-lived assets. Very few organisations have the necessary expertise and data to integrate climate change scenarios into their long-lived production asset accounting. This poses an additional risk to business and society. We explore different approaches for including risk and uncertainty in business accounting and reporting. Seven desk-based case studies of emerging practice in the food sector demonstrate how these varied climate risk and uncertainty models for infrastructure are being deployed around the world. Through review of data from company annual reports, documents and websites from 2021 to 2023, we find that specific climate-impacted long-lived asset accounting is relatively rare, notwithstanding that risk and uncertainty models are in effective use in other emerging areas.

Green innovation is believed to be a fundamental approach to environmental protection and determines the firms' competitiveness. Many factors drive the success of adopting green innovation. Unfortunately, many studies generally focus on large industries. This study investigates the influence of the firms' external pressure and internal factors simultaneously on the adoption of green innovation in small enterprises in developing countries. We conceptualized the four factors that may determine the successful implementation of green innovation to achieve sustainable performance, including environmental regulations, customer pressure, resources and capabilities, and management commitment. Data were gathered from 160 food sector SMEs in Malang Raya, Indonesia. Data analysis used structural equation modeling with the partial least squares approach (SEM-PLS). The empirical results conclude the positive effects of customer pressure, resources and capabilities, and commitment management on green innovation, which in turn had a positive on sustainable performance. The results also confirmed that environmental regulations did not significantly impact green innovation. The findings provide valuable contributions and encourage SMEs to foster green innovation's potential for better sustainable performance and competitive advantage. The findings also offer integrated perspectives on how firms should be more innovative toward sustainability. © 2023 United Nations.","customer pressure; environmental regulations; green innovation; management commitment; resources and capabilities; sustainable performance","Indonesia; developing world; environmental economics; innovation; performance assessment; regulatory framework; sustainability; sustainable development","E.R.

In past years, scholars and managers used ESG scores to express the sustainable development of an organization and other types of sustainability. Meanwhile, increasing literature has shown that ESG scores do not measure sustainability in terms of sustainable development. The main reason ESG scores fail to measure sustainability adequately is that ESG scores are not designed to measure sustainability concepts, such as temporality, impact, resources management, and interconnectivity. Furthermore, ESG scores apply materiality concepts, but what they measure is not always quantifiable, and most agencies that produce ESG scores lack transparency. This research reviewed the challenges and issues associated with ESG scores regarding sustainability representation. Then, based on the sustainability literature, different themes and concepts that would add more sustainability consideration to an ideal ESG score are presented.

Theoretical framework: This research is based on stakeholders and shareholders who also have rights to what they have provided to the company. Method: The study focuses on companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, analyzing the period from 2018 to 2021, which limits its scope to these entities during and before the pandemic. Utilizing ordinary least squares regression analysis through STATA, this study includes data from 146 companies. Results and conclusion: The results indicate that company size favorably influenced Financial Performances and negatively affected Firm Value during the pandemic. However, aspects of Corporate Governance, including the board of directors, the size of the board, independent directors and the audit committee, had no significant impact on the Financial Performance of the company's value during this period. Before the pandemic, the audit committee negatively affected Firm Value, company size was favorably correlated with Financial Performance and company age favorably influenced Firm Value. However, other elements of Corporate Governance, such as the board of directors, board size and independent directors, did not significantly affect the Financial Performance of the company's value. Implications of the research: This research offers important insights for companies in seeing how firm-related factors can lead to firm value in the capital market.

Referring to stakeholder theory, we focus on gender diversity, sustainability committees, and sustainability-related executive compensation. Based on European and South African firms (672 firm-year observations) between 2014 and 2019, we found that board gender diversity and sustainability-related executive compensation were significantly positively linked to MDQ. However, the implementation of sustainability committees does not affect the MDQ. Thus, only specific sustainable corporate governance variables in concrete contexts may be related to integrated reporting decisions. We also included Chief Executive Officer (CEO) power (pay slice, ownership, and tenure) as a moderator variable due to the strategic impact of CEOs, based on upper echelons theory, and found that the link between our included sustainable corporate governance variables and MDQ was weakened. Our results are robust to several variations and provide valuable insights for research, business practice and future regulations on integrated reporting. In view of massive regulatory reform initiatives on sustainable corporate governance and integrated reporting, sustainability expertise (also with regard to CEOs) should be better addressed in boards of directors during the next years to come. © 2022 The Author.

We focus on the role of corporate boards of directors, which shape firms' positions on internal and external issues of corporate governance and public policy. We argue that board decisions to engage constructively on climate issues are likely to be influenced by the choices and experiences of other firms. Learning, socialization, and competitive dynamics are especially important in highly salient and rapidly evolving policy areas, such as climate change. To test this theory, we construct the network of board memberships for US public corporations and uncover robust evidence that climate innovations diffuse among companies that share board members in common and among companies whose board members interact at separate boards.

This study employs a mixed-methods research approach, including quantitative research involving the construction of a model, Structural Equation Modeling-Latent Change Model with Vector Error Correction Model, to assess the above efficiency. Additionally, the findings from quantitative research are integrated into qualitative research to formulate proactive strategies for exercising state power to foster sustainable development. The findings indicate that the use of state power for the development of a green economy, in accordance with the 20-Year National Strategic Plan and various development strategies of Thailand, has proven to be inefficient. This inefficiency stems from continuous growth in the economic and social sectors, while the environmental sector has consistently deteriorated. The most significant contributing factor directly impacting the environment is the economic sector, followed by the social sector. Moreover, Thailand’s adaptability towards sustainability has been notably slow and falls below the established standards. If the government continues to use state power and pursue policies in a manner similar to the past, it is likely to have severe adverse consequences for the environment. This is due to the fact that reactive measures, including civil measures, administrative measures, and criminal measures, cannot effectively facilitate the development of a green economy. Therefore, the guidelines for addressing and formulating proactive strategies are of paramount importance and highly necessary for achieving sustainability. Research findings suggest that the government must establish reactive measures alongside proactive measures in economic aspects. These measures include (1) taxation and revenue collection; (2) subsidies and tax incentives; (3) financial enforcement incentives; (4) deposit systems and refund mechanisms; and (5) ownership and market creation systems. The study also reveals that countries efficiently implementing these economic measures for sustainability include European nations and Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. Consequently, Thailand should consider applying the research findings to appropriately and efficiently shape the use of state power before the nation causes further irreparable damage. It is imperative that these proactive measures are pursued diligently and continuously to promote green economy policies and ensure sustainability in both the present and future. © 2024, Econjournals.

Drawing on a dataset of Chinese A-share listed companies spanning 2008 to 2020, this research delves into the repercussions of economic policy uncertainty on the green technological pursuits of manufacturing firms and elucidates the underlying dynamics at play. The empirical evidence underscores a marked reluctance among companies to champion green technological innovation in the face of economic policy ambiguity, a stance that holds water even after rigorous robustness checks. Delving into the mechanisms, the study pinpoints heightened financial constraints and a diminishing risk appetite within the managerial ranks as pivotal deterrents steering firms away from green innovation projects amidst such uncertainty. Intriguingly, the adverse interplay between economic policy uncertainty and green innovation is especially accentuated in firms marked by tenuous government–business affiliations, pronounced monopolistic inclinations, lax intellectual property safeguards, minimal pollution footprints, and a skewed labor-to-capital composition. This investigation augments the scholarly discourse on the nexus between economic policy volatility and corporate green innovation, shedding light on strategic imperatives for emerging economies as they chart out future environmental blueprints and cultivate a conducive milieu for green innovation. © 2023 by the authors.","economic policy uncertainty; financing constraints; green technology innovation; green transition; management risk appetite","","X.

Considering the Italian manufacturing industry and according to the selected insolvency procedures, our results suggest that, if the time necessary to settle cases decreases by 20%, we can expect an increase in the financial debt ratio between 0.92% and 5.08% and a decrease in the trade credit ratio between 0.81% and 2.71%, as well as an increase in investments between 0.46% and 3.22%. These results are robust under a variety of tests and support the hypothesis that judicial inefficiency represents a barrier to environmental sustainability, preventing investments in key technologies able to support green strategies, as well as the key role of trade dynamics as alternative funding strategy for their business.

In detail, it has been hypothesized that the phenomenon of chief executive officer (CEO) duality, independent directors and female directors has a positive effect on the likelihood of a firm taking the model of a BC. Design/methodology/approach: A panel sample of 354 Italian firms taking the institutional model of BC and a control group of 600 firms extracted from the Aida BvD database were analysed. Data covers a period from 2009 to 2018. To empirically validate the advanced research hypotheses, four non-linear probit regression models were estimated. Findings: The results show that CEO duality seems to have a positive influence on the company’s likelihood of taking the model of a BC. Similarly, the independence of the board of directors and the gender diversity within the board of directors have a positive impact on the company’s likelihood of assuming the model of a BC. Originality/value: The research work contributes at integrating the emerging debates into the literature about the relationship between corporate governance and corporate responsibilities by expanding them into new and emerging business context of the hybrid organizational model. Further, the systematic use of the theoretical models of agency theory and stakeholder theory applied to socially responsible activities will improve the understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between corporate governance and choice for the institutional model of BC. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accounting; Analytics; Benefit company; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Hybrid organizational model; Italy","","A.

However, the impact of complying with these policies on companies is still a matter of debate. This study examined the effect of environmental performance on firm value mediated by financial performance. This quantitative research used the purposive sampling method to select the sample. The sample comprised 95 non-financial companies with an observation period from 2017 to 2021. The panel data was tested using path analysis in SEM-STATA. The results show that financial performance partially mediates the effect of environmental performance on firm value. Environmental performance can also have a direct impact on firm value. The result indicates that investors consider factors other than financial performance when making investment decisions. The results also show that environmental performance positively impacts financial performance. Furthermore, financial performance positively impacts firm value. Investors optimally use the non-financial information provided by the company. One type of non-financial information used is environmental performance. Investors are aware of the importance of the company’s concern for the impact of its operations on the environment. Companies that display good environmental performance tend to have a higher level of sustainability, which is profitable for investors. However, implementing strict environmental policies carries the risk that companies will move to countries with looser environmental policies. Developing countries, in particular, still need to overcome many obstacles in the implementation of environmental policies. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

Given the close relationship between CE activities and inbound open innovation (OI), we further consider the impact of the interaction between inbound OI and CE on enterprise innovation output. Based on data from Chinese listed companies, we found that CE can promote the improvement of enterprise innovation output, and the interaction between CE and OI can further enhance this effect. Further heterogeneity testing indicates differences in the roles of CE and inbound OI at regional and industry levels. The implicit suggestion from the results is that policy formulation should consider enterprise and regional attributes more to enable enterprises to benefit better from CE activities.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Circular economy (CE); innovation performance; open innovation (OI); resource-based view; stakeholder theory; text analysis","Economic and social effects; Circular economy; Collaboration; Government; Innovation performance; Open innovation; Resource-based view; Stakeholder; Stakeholder theory; Technological innovation; Text analysis; Competition","M.

Understanding the implications of IA for sustainability is critical since leveraging these technologies shapes operations and policies that can promote sustainable digitalization and automation practices. We study how firms' technological, organizational, environmental, and human resource contexts impact IA implementation. The study further explains how IA may associate with the firm's triple bottom line while accounting for the moderating role of corporate social responsibility strategy. The study surveyed 207 multinational firms in 2022 and used partial least square-structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed that IA implementation is mainly determined by the characteristics of the firm's internal environment, such as absorptive capacity, employee socio-behavioral concerns, and social capital competency. IA may offer valuable opportunities for boosting the firm's economic and environmental sustainability performance. Nonetheless, IA is a double-edged sword for social sustainability, harming social values in implementing firms with informal corporate social sustainability strategies. Conversely, firms with formal corporate social sustainability strategy have a significantly higher opportunity to transform the value of IA into social sustainability performance. Findings are expected to assist managers and decision-makers with streamlining an impartial and sustainable transition of organizations toward automation. © 2023 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Corporate social sustainability; Implementation; Intelligent automation; Robotic process automation; Sustainability","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Intelligent robots; Personnel; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social sustainability; Corporates; Implementation; Intelligent automation; Process automation; Robotic process automation; Social sustainability; Sustainability performance; Sustainability strategies; artificial intelligence; automation; corporate social responsibility; environmental economics; industrial performance; least squares method; multinational enterprise; robotics; sustainability; Sustainable development","M.

However, in recent years, listed mining companies have suffered serious financial risks due to special reasons such as poor spot market liquidity of their products, strong policy dependence, and long investment payback periods. In the previous studies, most of the financial crisis prediction focused on the whole industry and manufacturing industry. The research on the financial risk of mining enterprises focuses more on how to adjust R&D activities, environmental performance to improve the financial performance of enterprises. There is still a lot of room for in-depth research on the systematic prevention and early warning of financial risks of listed mining companies. At the same time, in terms of research methods, many scholars used multivariate discriminant model, logistic regression model and support vector machine model. Compared with the Back-Propagation (BP) neural network model, these model methods have more or less defects. Therefore, we take mining listed companies as the research object, select the financial data of China's A-share mining listed companies in 2018, and construct the BP neural network financial early warning model, trying to provide more practical means for the financial risk early warning of mining companies. The research conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The BP neural network financial early warning model constructed in this paper has high prediction accuracy, which can be well used in the practice of financial early warning of mining listed companies; (2) The financial situation of China's A-share mining listed companies in 2018 is generally in a good state. The companies with good financial status can effectively control the cost and have good debt paying ability while earning income; (3) For companies with financial status that require early warning, the root cause is mainly that they do not pay attention to the risk of bad debt losses, which makes current credit sales income and accounts receivable are at high levels, and they also do not have good profitability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Back-propagation (BP) neural network; Financial early warning; Mining listed companies","China; Backpropagation; Environmental management; Industrial research; Investments; Neural networks; Support vector regression; Backpropagation neural networks; Basic industries; Early warning; Early-warning models; Financial early warning; Financial risks; Mining companies; Mining listed company; National economy; Neural network modelling; artificial neural network; back propagation; financial crisis; financial market; mining industry; multivariate analysis; profitability; Support vector machines","Y.

Contextually, there is a scope to extend research in other emerging Asian markets which are under-researched such as Pakistan. The key theories applied in the domain of responsible innovation in Asia were the resource-based view and stakeholders’ theory and major themes for the outcomes were discussed from social, environmental, and economic perspectives. Theoretically, there is a scope to apply and empirically validate other theories such as legitimacy and reputation-building perspectives and resource-dependency.

It is being observed that many entrepreneurs venture into social enterprise because they perceive it as an opportunity. This study aims to address this phenomenon by extensively identifying the opportunity indicators that promote entrepreneurs to pursue social entrepreneurship. We accomplish this by employing a mixed-methods approach wherein we used both quantitative and qualitative data from experts and analysed it using a hybrid approach of Delphi rounds and the best-worst method. We identified 13 opportunity indicators from the literature, and in the first round of Delphi, four new indicators were added to the list by a panel of 24 experts drawn from industry and academia across India. In the second round of the Delphi method, 18 of the 24 experts took part and rated the importance of each indicator on a 5-point Likert scale. Depending on the availability of the experts, both rounds of Delphi were held in person and virtually. Based on the cut-off levels for standard deviation, interquartile range, and probability of occurrence, experts agreed on 16 indicators. Furthermore, a best-worst method approach was used to prioritise these indicators based on the opinions of industry and academic experts. The study used a theoretical lens of entrepreneurial opportunity and its two different views: objectively discovered and subjectively perceived. The results revealed a consensus among academicians and practitioners for objectively discovered opportunity indicators, which gave the highest priority to “institutional support” and “funding opportunities“. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Best-worst method; Entrepreneurial opportunity; Mixed-methods; Objectively discovered; Opportunity indicators; Social entrepreneurship; Subjectively perceived","India; academic research; Delphi analysis; entrepreneur; identification method; modeling; profitability; socioeconomic conditions; socioeconomic indicator; theoretical study","V.

Given the accelerated increase in remote working and collaboration during the COVID-19 crisis, this paper compares the determinants of sustainable technology adoption by employees across Western and Non-Western countries. Using a survey of 302 participants from 13 Western and non-Western countries, four proposed hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling and multi-group comparisons. The empirical results suggest a significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and usefulness, influencing employees’ attitudes towards using sustainable technologies. We also found a significant positive effect between attitude towards using sustainable technologies and actual use. The indirect effect of perceived usefulness and ease of use on actual use via attitudes towards using was also positive and significant. We, however, found no significant differences between Western and non-Western countries in terms of the adoption of sustainable technologies. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses international data extracted from global ESG data set from Thomson Reuters (Refinitiv) database. Using data of 23,137 firm-year observations from 37 countries, the authors perform regression analyses to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The findings show that firms with high board gender diversity exhibit high corporate sustainability performance. The authors also find firms in highly competitive industries to have low corporate sustainability performance. In highly competitive industries, the positive relationship between board gender diversity and corporate sustainability performance is weakened. The results are robust to various specification tests such as alternative measures for corporate sustainability performance, board gender diversity, product market competition and also the use of propensity score matching to address endogeneity issue. Overall, the results support the prediction that board diversity and product market competition play a substitutive role in influencing corporate sustainability performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers empirical evidence that the appointment of female directors is a useful way to improve a firm’s corporate sustainability performance, hence, providing significant benefits in terms of stakeholders’ values and corporate reputation. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights to investors and policymakers that intense industry competition might mitigate the role of board governance, particularly board gender diversity, in enhancing corporate sustainability performance. Originality/value: Using an international data set, where the observations operate in various market and institutional differences, this study is able to extricate the positive impact of board gender diversity and product market competition on corporate sustainability performance. This study corroborates evidence that sustainability strategy and initiatives are reflections of integrated factors, including corporate governance as internal driver and market forces faced by firms as external driver. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate board diversity; Corporate sustainability performance; Gender diversity; Product market competition","","K.A.

It incorporates recent concepts such as co-innovation, design thinking, lean innovation, and artificial intelligence models. In this relationship, through a comprehensive literature review, this article develops a theoretical context to understand the evolution of the theory and practice of IMTs. This study draws on field research with data on 529 Spanish firms, their IMTs and stakeholders' management practices, and their innovation results. Through a partial least squares (PLS) analysis, this study illustrates a model delineating the role of stakeholders' focused management on the effect of IMTs on a firm's innovation performance. This research concludes on the relevance of IMT use to the incremental innovation output of companies. The stakeholders' management and R&D focus is supporting the innovation process. The main result is that incremental innovation is the path to radical innovation development. Thus, the findings conclude that a well-structured innovation system with precise stakeholder engagement underpins overall inventive activity inside firms.

However, the management literature is limited regarding recent trends in the issues disclosed in these reports. In this era of multiple socio-economic crises (e.g., the global energy crisis, the Russo–Ukrainian war, and the COVID-19 pandemic), large companies have an even greater responsibility to the communities in which they operate. Given the above, the aim of this study was to examine recent sustainability reports and identify issues related to community impact. Specifically, the sustainability reports of S&P500 companies were analyzed using the Structural Topic Model in R. The results showed that the most common topics in sustainability disclosures related to community impact were “donations” and “STEM education”. Although “donations” as a topic was expected, “STEM education” emerged to highlight the importance of technology in today’s business world.

ESG scores and their dimensions serve as performance indicators and may also be risk components influencing cash flows. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ESG performance and firms’ diversification. We hand-collected data on business segments and geographical diversification from the constituents of the Euro Stoxx 50 over a large period, from 2002 to 2020. Our findings indicate that geographical diversification does not influence ESG variability. However, better ESG scores are observed in firms with more business segments, that do not have a dominant business segment with a significant role in the firm nor are concentrated in the most representative business segments. However, better ESG scores are also associated with greater asymmetry in the contribution of each business segment to the entire group.

This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and financial technology (FinTech) affect the exploitation of clean minerals in the pursuit of sustainable development. Employing wavelet analysis and quantile value-at-risk (QVaR), we provide a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic relationships, risks, and returns associated between clean minerals and these technological innovations. Our wavelet findings indicate that there are strong co-movements for aluminum, copper, and zinc with various clean and technological indices while nickel shows weak co-movements. Our QVaR results reveal significant differences in risk and return profiles across indices, underscoring the high-risk, high-reward nature of clean and technological sectors. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating AI and FinTech into regulatory frameworks and industry practices, advocating for a collaborative approach to leverage these technologies to influence the exploitation of clean minerals toward greater sustainability. Therefore, the novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive methodological approach to scrutinize the linkages between clean minerals and new-age technologies, with significant multi-stakeholder implications for policy and practice, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Clean minerals; Fintech; Quantile value-at-risk; Wavelet analysis","Sustainable development goals; Aluminium-zinc; Clean mineral; Comovement; Comprehensive analysis; New age; Quantile value-at-risk; Technological innovation; Value at Risk; Wavelet analyze; Wavelet-analysis; artificial intelligence; electronic commerce; environmental economics; exploitation; information and communication technology; mineral resource; policy approach; regulatory framework; risk assessment; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; wavelet analysis","W.M.

So-called science-based emission-reduction targets (SBTs) are aligned with the aim of the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C. These voluntary corporate emission targets are substantially more challenging than companies’ prevailing reduction objectives, because climate science guides the target setting. By 2021, more than 2200 companies had publicly engaged in SBTs, covering more than a third of the global market capitalization. The number of participating firms has essentially doubled every year since the first SBTs in 2015. Despite this increased empirical relevance, the impact of SBTs on firm outcomes remains unclear. Notably, their effect on corporate financial performance (CFP) is unknown. The present study addresses this research gap by empirically examining the relationship between corporate carbon emission performance (CCP) and CFP of firms with SBTs from 2015 to 2020. The cross-country panel comprises 2014 observations of 465 firms. Our findings indicate a positive association between CCP and CFP for firms engaging in SBTs, implying a positive relation between decarbonization efforts and financial results. We thereby advance research on the important question of when it pays to be green. On a practical level, we provide transparency on the effects of SBTs for managers and climate-change advocates. © 2022 The Authors.

Using grounded theory, this study conducts a qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with practitioners involved in this activity and shows the trade-offs and rational myths underlying this evaluation process. The image of rationality and rigorousness projected by sustainability risk measurements is mostly intended to address the increasing institutional pressures for reliable and comparable information, particularly from institutional investors and socially responsible investment decision makers. Nevertheless, risk analysts face serious challenges due to the lack of reliable information, the unpredictability of sustainability risks, the methodological issues related to the measurement process, and the complexity and context-dependency of risk assessment. These challenges call into question the official and optimistic rhetoric of rating agencies. This study contributes to the literature on sustainability risks and rational myths in organizations. Managerial implications and avenues for future research are also discussed. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ESG measurement; extrafinancial rating agencies; rational myths; socially responsible investment; sustainability risks","complexity; economic analysis; environmental economics; future prospect; investment; literature review; management practice; qualitative analysis; research work; risk assessment; sustainability; theoretical study; trade-off","D.

This study utilised samples from top 10 companies listed in 6 (six) different Global Islamic Indices with a three-year observation period (2017–2019) resulting in 99 observations. Global Islamic listed companies have rarely been studied in ESG-related issues. The pre-COVID-19 pandemic period was chosen to avoid the potential effects of pandemic on the subject of this study. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. It was found that all the independent variables simultaneously influence the ESG disclosure, while partially directors’ education are influencing the variable, and both R&D intensity and firm size do not influence the ESG disclosure. Confirming the agency theory, it is argued that the board characteristics are important in predicting overall board performance in carrying out their monitoring responsibilities, in this case, monitoring and encouraging companies to disclose more ESG information in their sustainability reports. This study signifies the role of directors even within the Islamic listed companies that the more highly educated the members of the board, they will tend to disclose more ESG information on their sustainability reports. This study contributes to the existing ESG disclosure and sharia-based investing literature by utilizing global-based indices instead of local indices in Muslim-majority countries, mirroring the current uptrend in world-wide sharia investing and the call for companies to be more sustainable in doing their business. © 2023 The Author(s).

We employ China's ADP as a quasi-natural experiment and use a difference-in-differences (DID) specification to explore the policy effects on CSR performance. Based on the data of China's A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019, we find that ADP would increase CSR performance by easing corporate financing constraints and improving firm performance. Besides, the policy effects are more pronounced on firms facing stronger market competition and firms with better corporate governance. These results suggest that ADP can be an incentive for CSR engagement and highlight the significance of improving marketization to make tax policies effective. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Financial constraints; Firm performance; Sustainable development; Tax incentives","Commerce; Depreciation; Economic and social effects; Investments; Taxation; Causal relationships; Corporate social responsibility; Depreciation policy; Financial constraints; Firm Performance; Investment incentives; Performance; Policy effects; Spillover effects; Tax incentive; Competition","L.

This study aims to fill this gap by examining the dissemination of circular economy (CE) information by airlines through their website and investigating the factors influencing the level of CED. Specifically, this study focuses on the characteristics of the board of directors, given its central role in shaping disclosure practices. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs manual content analysis to measure the extent of CE information disclosed by 105 international airlines through their website. It then conducts a regression analysis to examine the influence of board characteristics on the level of online CED. Findings: The results suggest that airlines with larger, more active and more independent boards of directors tend to be more inclined to disseminate CE information through their website. Furthermore, they demonstrate that board gender diversity does not significantly affect the extent of CE information disseminated. Originality/value: The study offers valuable contributions by extending CED research to the airline industry and exploring new channels for CE information dissemination. Additionally, it highlights the role of the board of directors in shaping CED practices and confirms the effectiveness of the stakeholder-agency theory in explaining this relationship. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airlines; Board of directors; Circular economy; Disclosure; Stakeholder-agency theory","Agency theory; Airline industry; Board characteristics; Boards of directors; Circular economy; Content analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Disclosure; Gender diversity; Stakeholder-agency theory; Air transportation","B.

The findings remain robust after key variable substitution, various matching methods, removal of special subsamples, identification tests of exogenous policy and alternative explanation exclusion. Additionally, the association between environmental investment and firm climate resilience is positively moderated by climate risk. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that environmental investment has a more noticeable positive impact in firms with abundant green human capital, less green production friendliness, advanced green finance capability, and suboptimal green ecological environment. Supplementary analysis verifies that environmental investment not only reduce pollutant emissions but also stimulate green transformation to achieve environmental innovation. In summary, proactive environmental strategy, especially environmental investment is not only an ethical responsibility, but also a strategic choice that helps to enhance firm climate resilience and adaptive capacity.

Legitimacy theory as well as the monitoring dimension of agency theory underlie the empirical investigation. The sample comprises Canadian and U.S. firms, for which a governance disclosure score and media legitimacy information are available from Bloomberg. Relying on structural equations modelling, results are the following. First, CDP disclosing firms exhibit an environmental disclosure score that is twice as high as non-disclosing firms. Second, media legitimacy, expressed by the Janis-Fadner index, is significantly lower for CDP disclosing firms. This may explain why high CO2 emission firms are less inclined to disclose CDP emission data. Third, the direct effect of the decision to disclose CDP emissions of CO2 (full sample) on environmental disclosure quality is positive and significant. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observe an indirect (mediating) effect on this relationship of media legitimacy (external monitoring) and corporate governance (internal monitoring). This suggests that media legitimacy and corporate governance enhance the positive impact of the decision to disclose CDP emissions of CO2 on environmental disclosure quality. Fourth, the direct effect of CDP emissions of CO2 (reduced sample) and environmental disclosure quality is positive and significant.

Panel data of 1914 observations from the UK and Turkey from 2016 to 2021 with a fixed effect model are used to estimate the results. The findings reveal that ESG indicators associate significantly with firms’ value. However, ESG indicators exhibit a stronger significant association with Tobin’s Q than stock prices and market-to-book value. This indicates that sustainability indicators are linked to the firm’s overall market value and the long-term run market valuation rather than just the stock market value. The results also reveal that while board independence, board expertise, and diversity exhibit a significant and positive association with firms’ value, board size negatively affects firms’ value. The current study provides unique contributions and comprehensive evidence based on different institutional and country sustainability enforcement statuses.

Digital transformation promotes green investment by improving internal control quality, increasing information transparency and ESG performance. We further find that the differences in firm characteristics and external environment also make the impact of digital transformation on enterprise green investment varied. Specifically, the promotion effect of digital transformation on green investment is greater in enterprises with low financing constraints, low risk enterprises and enterprises in the growth stage, and also greater in regions with developed digital financial inclusion and high government support and strong environmental regulation.

However, increasing the capital cost of private firms in China is a big challenge that needs to be addressed. This study intends to examine the role of optimal corporate social responsibility (CSR) investment while lowering the cost of equity capital and debt capital in Chinese private firms. In addition, this research study reveals the moderating role of state-owned shares in the association between CSR and private firms' capital costs. By taking a sample of Chinese private firms from 2011 to 2021, this study employs the CSR optimization method. The findings show that CSR optimization tends to reduce the cost of equity capital and debt capital in Chinese private firms. Further investigation shows that over-investment in CSR increases the cost of capital. Moreover, an increase in state-owned shares strengthens the negative relationship between the cost of debt capital and optimal CSR investments.

A similar but less pronounced trend is evident in the cases of Oceania and Northern America, while Asia is shown to be in a spreading out stage with a steady expansion. Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa have reached a full grown stage.

There are several main results shown as follows. Enhancing hedging strategies bolsters an insurer's interest margin and mitigates default risk. As the impact of events like regional conflicts and global warming intensifies, the adverse effects of hedging on default risk become clearer, enhancing insurance stability. Both black and green swan events positively affect the insurer's interest margin and default risk. Strict capital regulations are vital for sustainable insurance, safeguarding policyholders and fostering stability during extreme events.

In this context, this study selected A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2022 as samples and adopted a panel fixed-effect model to empirically test the impact and mechanism of ESG performance on continuous innovation. The research showed that ESG performance could significantly promote corporate continuous innovation. The mechanism tests found it worked mainly through the channels of alleviating financing constraints, increasing social trust, reducing agency costs, focusing on human capital, and enhancing social capital. Heterogeneity tests found that this effect was more significant for state-owned enterprises, weak marketization, and epidemic shocks. Further research showed that ESG exhibited a more significant level of sustained innovation in the growth and maturity stages.

We test the hypothesized relationships by a study of 221 start-ups in Colombia and 203 start-ups in Australia and validate the theoretical model using survey information. We apply a structural equation modelling partial least squares structural equation modelling and multi-group approaches. The results verify the positive influence of SE on SP independently of NLC development. Nevertheless, network learning as a capability acts as a moderator by establishing the impact of the SE on SP. The moderating is determined by a strong NLC linking the SE's government, financial and organisational support. The findings contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and innovation with relevant management implications by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of SE in terms of SP effectiveness. © The Author(s) 2023.","network learn capability; partial least squares structural equation modelling and multi-group analysis; Start-up ecosystems; start-up performance","","G.

Our results show large allocations in line with the SDGs, which demonstrates these investors' aim of achieving real-word changes. Furthermore, we show that these “impact investors” have a clear preference for SDGs that are associated with high financial returns. As such, we confirm that both impact and attractive financial returns are expected. Our findings provide rich, deep insights into how HNWIs practice impact investing and their underlying motivations.

In this study sampling 24 international hotel firms during the period of 2013–2019, we examine how ESG standards improve these hotels’ operational efficiency obtained via data envelopment analysis (DEA). We further investigate how ESG can help manage a crisis by examining the period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results reveal that ESG can indeed enhance hotels’ efficiency. Specifically, the social and environmental aspects are the most important factors that contribute to the operational efficiency of hotel firms. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, hotel firms with the best ESG practice can be more efficient than others, especially those that have very high environmental and social scores. Overall, our findings suggest that hotel firms should consider ESG investment, not only as an effective and sustainable strategy during normal times but also as a crisis management strategy to overcome unexpected crises that may arise in the future.

A rigorous literature review of current international articles is used in this paper. The meta-analysis method was utilized to examine papers published in high-evaluation scientific publications indexed in Scopus. The tool (WordStat 8) was utilized to study articles and summarize descriptive statistics, correlation, and keyword cloud during the analysis process. According to the study, the board of directors works to protect investments from misappropriation by actively participating in the development of the company's strategy, giving appropriate incentives to management, and monitoring and evaluating its performance, thus maximizing the company's value. The audit committee can be used as a governance mechanism to improve financial information confidence and openness. Through their participation in the financial statement preparation process as well as improving the independence of both internal and external auditors, the audit committee can help prevent future financial disasters. The study discovered that the emphasis on a company's ownership is critical, and that focusing on the largest shareholder can considerably boost the company's long-term profitability. As a result, it is obvious that the current shifts in ownership focus will diminish performance, but that the negative effects will fade with time and may even have a beneficial impact on the organization's performance. The study will benefit a variety of stakeholders, including investors, stakeholders, company CEOs, board of directors, and other connected groups. Furthermore, guiding shareholders, investors, and stakeholders to make decisions based on reasonable and objective foundations follows a true assessment of the company's market value. This study offers both academics and professionals a written review of the study as well as an updated reference index to measure the relationship between governance and financial success from 2017 to 2020. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.","Audit Committee; Board; Financial Performance; Firms Value; Ownership","","","English","Univ.

This study posits that a substantive internalization of respect for human rights in business operations can be supported by a human-oriented approach to corporate governance that fosters an ethical organizational culture in which protecting and promoting LHR is viewed not as a moral option, but as a fundamental responsibility, thereby encouraging corporate transparency in this regard. The results obtained from a balanced data panel of 792 multinationals over the period 2011–2020 show that companies with a human-oriented approach to corporate governance disclose more comprehensive information on LHR issues. Furthermore, the results indicate that LHR performance negatively moderates the relationship between human-oriented governance and the level of LHR disclosure. © The Author(s) 2025.","Corporate disclosure; Corporate governance; Due diligence; Human rights","","N.

Design/methodology/approach: A multimethod approach is employed where the data (161 responses) are drawn from two quantitative data sources. The primary data are obtained from the questionnaire survey, and the secondary data are gathered from the annual reports. Multiple linear regression analysis is used as the analytical method. Findings: This study finds that gender diversity is positively and significantly associated with big data analytics investments. Next, the association between gender diversity and big data analytics investments is negatively moderated by education diversity. The association between gender diversity and big data analytics investments is weakened when the education diversity is higher. Originality: This study is one of the first to examine the intervening processes of how gender diversity affects big data analytics investments using education diversity as a moderating variable. This study is novel in its approach to providing empirical evidence and examining the moderating effect of education diversity. Practical implications: This study shows that gender diversity facilitates big data analytics investments. The findings help policymakers encourage the female director’s role in strategic decision-making. The negative moderating effect of education diversity on gender diversity and big data analytics investments association implies that firms may face challenges accessing resources.

The study is based on secondary data over a period from 2015 to 2021. The results are estimated using panel data with fixed-effect models. The results indicate that liquidity enhances and strengthens the ability of a company to spend more on environmental, social, and employee compensation sustainability expenses. In the same context, the results reveal that there is an insignificant moderation effect of liquidity with the financial performance of a company, indicating that the liquidity of companies with higher financial performance does not enhance and strength their ability to spend more on sustainability expenses. Further, the extent of liquidity in larger companies affects positively and significantly the level of employee compensation but not environmental and social spending. Finally, the findings show that greater leverage with less liquidity negatively affects the levels of sustainability spending. This study provides a unique contribution to the existing literature by introducing the moderating effect of liquidity on the relationship between firms' specific and sustainability expenditures. It highlights the direct effect of firms' specific determinants and the moderating effect of liquidity on three categories of sustainability expenses which are environmental expenses, social expenses, and employee compensations.

This study assesses the feasibility of alternative fuels for the Estonian pilot fleet using a Well-to-Wake (WtW) life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Operational data from 18 vessels, sourced from the Estonian State Fleet’s records, were analyzed, including technical specifications, fuel consumption patterns, and operational scenarios. The study focused on marine diesel oil (MDO), biomethane, hydrogen, biodiesel, ammonia, and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), each presenting distinct trade-offs. Biomethane achieved a 59% GHG emissions reduction but required a volumetric storage capacity up to 353% higher compared to MDO. Biodiesel reduced GHG emissions by 41.2%, offering moderate compatibility with existing systems while requiring up to 23% larger storage volumes. HVO demonstrated a 43.6% emissions reduction with seamless integration into existing marine engines. Ammonia showed strong potential for long-term decarbonization, but its adoption is hindered by low energy density and complex storage requirements. This research underscores the importance of a holistic evaluation of alternative fuels, taking into account technical, economic, and environmental factors specific to regional and operational contexts. The findings offer a quantitative basis for policymakers and maritime stakeholders to develop effective decarbonization strategies for the Baltic Sea region. © 2025 by the authors.","alternative fuels; GHG emissions; pilotage; shipping","","J.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have adopted a quantitative approach based on an ordinary least squares cross-sectional regression analysis for the companies of the S&P 1200 in 2022. Findings: The results suggest that the board of directors plays an important role in human rights respect, particularly with regard to board gender diversity, attendance, the non-executive directors and chief executive officer (CEO) duality. In contrast, board size and board structure do not have a significant impact on human rights compliance. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained offer useful implications for the existing literature and provide valuable insights for managers, regulators and policymakers. However, there are some limitations, particularly in relation to the time period analysed.

However, this industry has a significant impact on the environment, which is essential to know and understand. In this article, we explore the importance of the circular transition in the agri-food industry and analyse the role that female directors, C-suite executives or managers and employees play in it. For a sample of the most relevant 243 agri-food companies worldwide, over the period 2013–2022, we conduct Tobit and lineal regressions for panel data to attend to gender diversity in firms and its consequences concerning this circularity environmental model. In a sector with unbalanced organisational levels in terms of gender, the results show that the overall diversity of the companies favours the transition towards a circular model that is respectful of the environment, favouring the optimisation of resources and processes that lead to the generation of minimum waste, and unequivocally opting for ecological inputs, technologies, spaces and other goods. However, the individualised study of diversity at the organisational levels confirms the unquestionable role that female leadership plays in the circular transition of the agri-food sector when exercised from C-suite positions. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper aims to comprehensively investigate how the centralization of national environmental quality monitoring policy via the EEMPW affects corporate greenwashing behavior, and evaluate the reacting mechanisms. The empirical findings derived by the continuous difference-in-differences models show that the EEMPW significantly curbs firms’ hypocritical greenwashing behaviors, and by increasing financial constraint level, the greenwashing behaviors can be significantly reduced. This paper finds that firms in cleaner production industries, firms in regions with highly developed green finance, firms in highly environmentally regulated areas, and state-owned enterprises are more restrained in greenwashing. Furthermore, our mechanism analyses show that financially constrained firms reduce their likelihood of greenwashing behavior by compressing management and financial costs, and facilitating green innovation efficiency behaviors. Our findings provide suggestions for curbing greenwashing behaviors and for improving the efficiency of the government regulation of ecological, climate and environmental targets in economic growth. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous DID; Ecological environmental monitoring power withdrawal; Financial constraint; Greenwashing","","","English","J.

This review makes four contributions. First is the synthesis of a large strand of literature in a structured setting, so as to be readily handled by both experts and non-experts. Second is the observation that stock market penalties in the event of environmental concerns are likely to be quite low: on average there is a (temporary) drop in the excess stock market return to events that are harmful to the environment of about 2% and the median is −0.6%.

The results indicate that SDD negatively affects ESG scores, potentially due to increased bureaucracy. Conversely, SII, characterized by mechanisms such as policy incentives and governance support, positively influences ESG outcomes. Additionally, companies operating in predatory States exhibit significantly lower ESG performance, highlighting governance challenges in such environments.

The data were subjected to structural equation modeling using SmartPLS. Findings: This study confirmed that packaging-free practices positively influence brand image, brand trust, satisfaction and customer loyalty. The expected positive impacts of brand image and satisfaction on customer loyalty were also confirmed. However, the expected impact of brand trust on customer loyalty was not confirmed. Practical implications: This article demonstrates how a competitive sector can reap benefits from implementing sustainable practices in the operational domain, particularly by offering packaging-free products at the point of purchase. Thus, as recommended, general retail stores (e.g. supermarkets) gradually increase the stores' offering of packaging-free food products, as this practice has been shown to have positive impacts not only on brand image, but also on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Originality/value: This study extends the literature on the effects of sustainable practices on customer loyalty, by focusing on a specific practice. Furthermore, this study contributes to the advancement of research on packaging-free practices in retail by developing a research framework and providing evidence on the direct and indirect effects of this specific practice on customer loyalty. © 2023, Belem Barbosa, Alireza Shabani Shojaei and Hugo Miranda.","Brand image; Brand trust; Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Packaging-free products; Supermarkets; Sustainability; Unpackaged products","","B.

This study aims to dissect the spatio-temporal evolution of social governance innovation themes and explore the value network relationships among multiple stakeholders in social governance. To achieve this, we employ natural language processing to analyze text data from 285 social governance innovation cases. This analysis allows us to delve into the progression of social governance innovation practice themes, discern inherent patterns and modes, and reveal their spatio-temporal characteristics. These insights form the basis for our proposed recommendations on policy-making and public service delivery to address public problems. Concurrently, we utilize the ERNIE-UIE model for transfer learning to extract entities related to social governance stakeholders from the cases. Our findings suggest that governance practices extending beyond the government to include all possible stakeholders, such as enterprises and civil society, are essential. When combined with social network analysis, we can illuminate the value network relationships among these multiple social governance stakeholders surrounding particular innovative practice themes.

Design/methodology/approach: Data of non-financial listed companies operating in China from 2010 to 2019 were employed. Dual fixed-effects and dynamic panel models were used to explore the relationship between CSR and corporate innovation efficiency, and analyse its heterogeneity. Findings: The researchers found that CSR reduces innovation efficiency in China. Further, (1) when enterprises conduct CSR to obtain excess returns, it is easy to form excess goodwill; (2) under the pressure of the government and society, enterprises passively assume CSR, thereby crowding out R&D funds; and (3) regardless of whether companies in the high-tech industry actively or passively assume social responsibilities, CSR will not have a significant impact on their innovation efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The sample of this research is limited to Chinese A-share listed companies and lacks consideration for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, whether the conclusions of this article are applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises or family enterprises needs further verification. Practical implications: The research explores the intrinsic motivation and possible consequences of CSR from the dual perspectives of corporate active and passive. Social implications: The ultimate goal of a firm is to make a profit. In practice, few enterprises pay without any return. Perhaps some companies actively assume social responsibilities in order to obtain greater benefits, while passively assume social responsibilities due to oppression. Originality/value: This study analyses the impact of CSR on corporate innovation efficiency from both active and passive perspectives.

Next, a higher order association of these hierarchies was proposed, establishing a triad model that indicated only the most representative combinations of dimensions, resulting from the extraction of the most significant definitions.

Furthermore, the study investigates the moderating role of business ownership type in the relationship between social responsibility and competitive advantage. This study employed a quantitative research design. The survey questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were collected from 385 customers of selected commercial banks in Ethiopia. The study used Partial Least Square Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test relationships between variables. Social responsibility practice is measured from the perspectives of banks' philanthropic, economic, legal, and ethical activities. Bank ownership type was considered a moderating variable. The study findings show that social responsibility practices significantly influence the bank's competitive advantage. Similarly, including the moderating variable, bank ownership type, did not significantly change the relationship between social responsibility practices and competitive advantage. The results provide useful insights for business executives and practitioners who want to include sustainability into their strategy frameworks, fostering economic, social, and environmental well-being.

Our results found that IQLE negatively moderates and weakened the positive relationship between CSR and firm financial performance.

Among the others, stricter regulations could undermine companies' financial performances, affecting operations costs and revenues and their impact being proportional to the business carbon intensity. Transition risk disclosure takes two forms. One is a textual description of transition risk in compulsory and voluntary non-financial disclosure. The other is the disclosure of carbon emissions and intensity, which is implicitly associated with transition risk exposure. We empirically assess the impact of the two transition risk measures on shareholder returns to test the “carbon premium” hypothesis. We consider shareholder return as the sum of capital gain and dividend paid and analyse the impact of transition risk on both. Evidence supports the “carbon premium” hypothesis but suggests such a premium is transferred to shareholders primarily via dividend payouts. One possible explanation consistent with this evidence is that boards in highly polluting companies use dividends to compensate investors for the relatively lower capital gain, dissuading them from divesting due to low returns, stigmatisation effects and regulatory risks. © 2024","Climate risk; Mandatory disclosure; SEC-10K; Text analysis; Transition risk","Investments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Shareholders; Capital gains; Carbon intensity; Climate risk; Low-carbon transitions; Mandatory disclosure; SEC-10k; Shareholder returns; Stock returns; Text analysis; Transition risk; carbon emission; climate change; compensation system; data mining; environmental economics; industrial emission; Carbon","S.

It is found that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between task-related faultline and green technology innovation, while bio-demographic faultline has no significant influence on green technology innovation. In addition, both green technology innovation and environmental information disclosure have positive effects on financial performance, while the moderating effect of environmental information disclosure on innovation-performance doesn't exist. Combined with the research results, the practical implications for policy makers and managers and future research avenue are proposed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental information disclosure; Financial performance; Green technology innovation; Top management team faultlines","China; Commerce; Disclosure; Inventions; China; environmental management; firm size; green economy; innovation; management practice; policy making; stock market; article; China; demography; human; manager; motivation; stock market; commercial phenomena; interpersonal communication; invention","Y.

The main objective of this article is to study the role of sustainability (eco-innovation and circular economy) in the internationalization of the textile industry in Portugal. For this, a qualitative methodology was used, through semi-structured interviews applied to four managers of the textile sector, in the north of Portugal. The results of the interviews were submitted to a content analysis and data coding system using the NVIVO software. The results show that sustainability is a pillar of direct and/or indirect internationalization, either through the demand of the consumer for sustainable products or through the availability of the products produced by companies; this is motivated mainly by customers, even if the high price of these products when they reach the market is concerning. With the results achieved, this article shows that the determining factor for eco-innovative and recycled products is the price factor. The high price that eco-innovative and recycled products have when they reach the market is the main concern that the companies interviewed have in terms of investing more in this type of product. However, they claim that there is a clear increase in demand for these products and that it is a differentiating factor in international markets. It also became evident that the existence of products from the circular economy increases the companies’ value and acceptance in international markets. This article provides empirical evidence that shows that the transition from a linear to a circular economy requires large investments in most cases; however, it is currently a competitive advantage and a positioning in a differentiating sector, increasing the brand’s social responsibility. © 2023 by the authors.","circular economy; eco-innovation; internationalization; sustainability; textile","Portugal; economic conditions; globalization; innovation; market conditions; questionnaire survey; sustainability; textile industry","A.R.

This necessitates improved sustainability-based management and Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) engagement, emphasizing the importance of understanding the influence of Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP) on innovation performance and economic consequences. The current study investigates this relationship by looking at how banks funding and government subsidies in China affect the relationship between innovation performances and financing constraints through a quantitative analysis from 2008 to 2017. The findings not only revealed a statistically significant association and influence of CEP on Chinese business innovation performance and financing restrictions, they also confirm the mediating role of bank funding on innovation performance and financing constraints. All CER’s CEP indicators had a favorable and significant impact on innovation performance, although the mediation of banking finance was particular to innovation performance and financing restrictions. They also reveal a negative significant influence of CEP on budgetary restrictions. Since a proactive environmental strategy has no negative economic effects, the report advises Chinese listed companies to incorporate CER participation to boost innovation and ease financing limitations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bank funding; Corporate environmental performance; Corporate environmental responsibility; Financing constraints; Government subsidies; Innovation performance","China; banking; corporate social responsibility; finance; innovation; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability","Z.

There is a gap between knowledge and practice in the ESG performance of Chinese enterprises, and digital transformation (DT) provides new ideas for ESG development. The research purpose of this paper is to explore the impact mechanism of DT on ESG and the specific path of DT to drive ESG. It provides a reference for listed enterprises to rely on DT to empower their sustainable development capability. This paper takes the panel data of A-share listed enterprises from 2011 to 2021 as the sample and measures the core indicators using the text mining method, modified Jones model, and Roy-Chowdhury model. On this basis, using a combination of econometric models and qualitative comparative analysis, we empirically analyze the impact mechanisms of DT on ESG as well as the specific grouping paths that drive ESG performance. The main conclusions are shown as follows. First, DT can significantly reduce ESG, with an impact coefficient of − 0.013, which is significant at the 5% level. It reflects that the DT of enterprises at this stage has certain deficiencies. There is a matching lag in the enterprise's internal organizational resources. The entry of digital technology will have a certain impact on traditional operations, and the high uncertainty of DT adds some hidden costs to the enterprise. Secondly, there is an indirect suppression effect of accrued earnings management (AEM) in the transmission mechanism of DT affecting ESG. It is verified that DT can reduce information asymmetry and inhibit EM activities, thus reducing the impact on ESG. Finally, a total of six configurations achieved high ESG valuations. High technology practice-low performance manipulation; digital intelligence-low performance manipulation; digital intelligence-digital resources; digital resources-inadequate digital infrastructure.; high technology practice-bottom technology deficiency; digital intelligence-high performance manipulation. Through configuration analysis, the suppression effect of EM is further verified. The lack of AEM is usually the core condition of the high-valuation group. Meanwhile, digital intelligence, digital resources, and digital technology practice can drive the improvement of enterprise ESG. The instrumental variables approach and robustness tests support these findings. © 2024, The Author(s).","","article; Chinese; controlled study; digital technology; econometric model; human; information asymmetry; instrumental variable analysis; intelligence; sustainable development","S.

In the paper, the principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimension of the evaluation indicators of consumers purchase decision, and an evaluation index system for consumers' purchase of casual snacks under livestreaming was established, which consists of 5 first-level indicators and 20 sub-level indicators. In view of the uncertainty of expert evaluation, Using Fuzzy-DEMATEL analysis the evaluation index's logical relationships and influence relationships, and an Analytic Network Process (ANP) network based on the importance and relevance of consumer purchase influence was constructed. The weighted method of Fuzzy-DEMATEL and ANP combination is used to improve the objectivity of indexing importance. The experimental results showed that the amount of transaction guided by anchors, popularity of anchors, teamwork ability of livestreaming, brand awareness of snack and selection ability of livestreaming team were the key factors for consumers' purchasing decisions of snack under livestreaming. This research could help livestreaming e-commerce platforms, businesses and livestreaming marketing teams understand the consumers behavior better, thus improve the purchase intention of consumers from the key factors affecting their decision-making, increase the sales volume and the amount of attention of the products, and increase the volume of guided transactions and the number of fans for the livestreaming marketing teams.  © 2023 Xiaoping Zhu et al., published by Sciendo.","ANP; Fuzzy-Dematel; key factors; livestreaming marketing; PCA","Anchors; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Purchasing; Sales; Uncertainty analysis; Analytic network; Analytic network process; Commerce platforms; Consumer purchase; E- commerces; Fuzzy dematel; Key factors; Livestreaming marketing; Network process; Principal-component analysis; Principal component analysis","L.

There has been a notable absence of studies examining the degree of adherence to sustainability based on the latest indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G4) Guidelines and its impact on financial performance, specifically within the banking sector in emerging Arab economies. Consequently, this study explores the correlation between the degree of adherence to sustainability and its dimensions (economic, social, and environmental) as defined by GRI-G4 and financial performance within a sample of banks in Arab nations (the United Arab Emirates “UAE” and Iraq) from 2019 to 2021. The research hypotheses were examined using a multiple linear regression model. The empirical findings reveal that, on average, UAE banks exhibit a sustainability adherence level of 57% according to GRI-G4, while their Iraqi counterparts demonstrate a significantly lower adherence of 17%. Notably, the degree of sustainability adherence substantially impacts the financial performance of banks in both countries. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the economic dimension of sustainability has a positive impact, while the environmental dimension has a negative impact, and in contrast, the social dimension does not significantly affect the financial performance of banks in both countries. This study provides insights for banks and policymakers to enhance their sustainability practices and elevate the level of disclosure, especially within Arab nations. This, in turn, can lead to greater compliance with sustainability standards, improved transparency, and reduced information asymmetry. © 2024 by the authors.","commercial banks; financial performance; global reporting initiative; guidelines G4; stakeholder theory; sustainable development","","M.J.

However, the effects that different types of indirect CSP signals have on firm value have remained largely unexplored. Furthermore, managers often do not fully understand how to communicate CSP effectively. In this article, we operationalize CSP as a multidimensional construct and draw on signalling theory to examine how different types of indirect CSP signals impact firm value. The results of an event study show that institutionalized third parties can play an important role in delivering credible CSP-related information to the market. Results also demonstrate that the valence (positivity vs. negativity) and content (the specific social domain) of indirect CSP signals are important predictors of the magnitude of market reactions, and that shareholders' responses to the valence and content of indirect CSP signals have substantially changed over time.

First, using trading volume, the authors establish that the perceived value of moral capital generated by news involving institutional (e.g., environmental and community) stakeholders is less clear to investors than that of the news involving technical (e.g., customers and employees) stakeholders. Subsequently, the authors analyze abnormal returns from 565 unique firm events—each comprising at least one positive and one negative stakeholder news item. Using signaling theory, the authors demonstrate that news of the number of CSR activities involving institutional groups counteracts the effects of same day CSiR news in an inverted U-shaped fashion. In contrast, they find that news of the number of CSR activities involving technical groups mitigates the effects of same day CSiR news in a U-shaped fashion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Event study; Institutional CSR; Signaling theory; Technical CSR; Trading volume","","C.

This study aims to advance the existing literature by concentrating on three indicators of greening in corporations namely resource use, emissions and eco-innovation, and examining their value relevance in the stock market at the global level. Furthermore, we deepen the investigation by exploring the moderating role of eco-innovation and the CSR committee between greening in corporations and market value. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the study were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the years between 2002 and 2019 and contain 17,961 firm-year observations which are analyzed through fixed-effects regression. Findings: The results reveal that while resource usage is viewed as value-relevant by the market, the emissions and eco-innovation are not. However, despite eco-innovation per se not being value-relevant, its interaction with resource usage and emissions is value-relevant. Furthermore, CSR committees undertake a very critical role in translating greening practices into market value. Research limitations/implications: While the results for emissions support the cost-concerned school, the findings for resource usage confirm the value creation school. Furthermore, the interaction effect of eco-innovation and CSR committee confirms the resource-based theory and stakeholder theory, respectively. Practical implications: Investors regard eco-innovation-induced pro-environmental behaviors as value-relevant. These results propose firms replace eco-innovation at the focal point in developing environmental strategies and connecting other greening efforts to it. Moreover, CSR committees are critical to corporations in translating greening practices into firm value by developing and implementing disclosure and communication strategies. Originality/value: The study’s originality stems from investigating the synergetic effect that eco-innovation and CSR committees generate in translating greening practices to greater market value at a global scale. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CSR committee; Eco-innovation; Emissions; Environmental performance; Greening; Resource use","","A.S.

In this context, risk-taking is defined based on the operational risk faced by the banks. The study employs the two-step system generalised method of moments (2SYS-GMM) estimation technique, using a panel dataset of 14 commercial banks in Ghana from 2010 to 2022. The corporate governance variables considered include board size, board independence, board meetings, and financial expertise on the board, with firm growth included as a control variable. This study shows that board meetings have a positive and significant relationship with operational risk in banks. Conversely, board size is negatively and significantly associated with operational risk. However, board independence and financial expertise on the board do not have any impact on operational risk. Additionally, firm growth is found to have an inverse relationship with bank risk. The paper highlights the risk-taking behaviour of boards in commercial banks in Ghana, specifically showing that larger board size reduces the level of risk, supporting the principles of agency theory. The findings offer valuable insights for regulators and policymakers to enhance internal corporate governance mechanisms to safeguard banks during financial distress. Additionally, these findings can boost shareholder and stakeholder confidence in the effectiveness of governance reforms, promoting long-term benefits. © The Author(s) 2025.","Banks; Corporate governance; Operational risk","","B.S.

Design/methodology/approach: The panel data of non-financial firms were collected for eight years (2013–2020). This study used distinct proxies of CA, including adjusted firm return on assets and adjusted firm Tobin's q, and a third proxy used to discover the combined validity of the findings. The CSR disclosure was measured by developing an index, while the amount of CSR expenditure was collected from firms' annual reports. Findings: The empirical results of Arellano–Bond estimator showed that CSR disclosure and expenditure have a positive and significant impact on CA. This relationship is also tested with CI as a moderator, the results of moderation showed that CI strengthens the relationship between studied variables. Originality/value: This research tries to bridge the gap between CSR and CA through CI. It is also an addition to the existing literature by addressing the issue of CA generated from CSR activities.

For this purpose, a theoretical model is elaborated based on the literature review carried out, which is contrasted following a quantitative approach by means of structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with primary data collected from 202 Spanish wineries between September 2021 and January 2022. The research results show that there is a positive and significant relationship between OA and sustainable performance. Likewise, OA partially mediates the CSR-sustainable performance and KMI-sustainable performance relationship. Thus, the present research contributes to the literature in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have analyzed the effect of OA on sustainable performance in the wine context, which represents an opportunity to advance scientific knowledge. Second, to our knowledge, there is no previous scientific production that has analyzed what may be the triggers of OA. Third, the proposed theoretical model has not been addressed previously, so that, through the research, a new way of understanding the improvement in the economic, social and environmental performance of wineries is formulated [EconLit Citations: L66, 03, M1]. © 2023 The Authors.

Building upon existing research, we explored whether clan culture, as a potent indigenous force in China, regulates corporate environmental behavior. The findings suggest that clan culture significantly improves corporate environmental performance, while environmental regulations from the government and internal green management practices weaken this effect. After controlling for endogeneity issues and conducting robustness checks, these conclusions hold true. Further examination reveals that clan culture primarily functions through shaping moral environments and enhancing environmental awareness among top executives. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that this effect is more pronounced in companies where top executives lack green experiences and environmental disclosure is poorer. Clan culture also significantly improves corporate ESG environmental assessments and reduces corporate carbon emissions levels but negatively impacts corporate green innovation activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Clan; Corporate environment performance; Green governance; Green perception; Moral","China; Green economy; Clan; Corporate environment; Corporate environment performance; Corporate environmental performance; Corporates; Green governance; Green perception; Moral; Performance; Top executive; carbon emission; cultural influence; emission control; environmental values; governance approach; indigenous population; innovation; Green development","X.

Furthermore, continuation of business-as-usual (BAU) approaches to dealing with ocean-uses and marine ecosystem impacts, instead of EBM, may mean missing out on significant ecological, social, and economic benefits. One way to advance beyond BAU approaches to managing marine ecosystems and their uses is establishing a solid business case for EBM. Here we present a business case for EBM with the goal of showing that EBM is not only ecologically preferable but also economically advantageous compared to BAU. We present four case studies with estimates of the value proposition for conducting BAU and EBM in these instances. Categorically EBM has a stronger business case than BAU. In all the cases, even given the caveats of the methodology and precision of the estimates, EBM was cheaper, more efficient, was better able to handle tradeoffs across ocean-use sectors, better accommodated non-economic and non-human commerce considerations, and provided more benefits. Conversely, BAU was costlier than EBM options. We trust that these reality-based, hypothetical examples at least broaden the discussion of moving towards EBM and assert that they provide evidence to further support the broader consideration and adoption of EBM, or at least should spark discussion as to why not. © 2024","Benefits; Business-as-usual; Costs; Ecosystem approaches; Efficiency; Goods and services; Risks; Tradeoffs; Value proposition","business; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem approach; ecosystem management; marine ecosystem; trade-off","J.S.

As a result, UN agencies have begun to prioritize the utilization of the digital revolution to advance SDGs. There is a growing body of literature on the use of digital money to achieve sustainability objectives. As businesses commit to protecting the environment, natural systems, and society, consumer eco-awareness has elevated the importance of the issue in the field of sustainable digital finance. The rationale behind this study is to unify the fragmented literature on digital money and to present a clear conceptual framework for sustainable digital finance in order to advance sustainability goals. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the evolution of sustainable digital finance through analyzing publication and citation trends, developing an author-country-keyword framework, and exploring the significant themes and subjects emerging from the field of sustainable digital finance. Additionally, the study examines ongoing shifts in the digital finance sector and the digital sustainable revolution, which can help us harness technology for social good (Grand Challenge: social work) and move closer to achieving sustainable development goals. We employ a two-tiered analytic strategy, comprising of bibliometric analysis and an integrated literature evaluation of 168 publications from the Web of Science database. In addition to descriptive and thematic analysis, the findings provide us with seven relevant themes (financial involvement and participation, sustainable financial development, green finance, digital venture capital, fintech, financial performance, and digital strategy) and four prominent aggregate dimensions (digital financial inclusion, digital sustainable revolution, digital financial transformation, and harness technology for social good), which will be included in the conceptual framework for future research endeavors.

From an instrumental perspective, eco-friendly business models should strengthen operations efficiency and improve companies' reputations while also creating conditions for stronger financial performance. Accordingly, the present study examines the drivers leading aerospace companies to engage in corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and its impacts. First, we investigate whether and to what extent the characteristics of the board, as an effective corporate governance (CG) mechanism, foster CER. Second, we analyse the impact of CER engagement on both accounting- and market-based measures of corporate financial performance (CFP). Using a worldwide sample of 157 aerospace companies over the period from 2005 to 2019, this study identifies notable findings. In the first stage, the results show that identified characteristics of the board of directors are positive predictors of higher CER engagement. In the second stage, the findings indicate that CER engagement drives higher profitability and positive appreciation among financial stakeholders. Consistent with this win-win scenario, we provide empirical support for the conflict resolution hypothesis at the governance level. Furthermore, we recommend that firms in the aerospace industry increase their involvement in environmental policies that enhance competitive advantage and market value. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","competitiveness; conflict management; corporate social responsibility; economic impact; finance; sustainable development","F.

We find that the first-order effect of the trade war on corporate innovation is significantly negative. That is, Chinese firms exposed to the US–China trade war have lower numbers of patent applications and invention patent applications. Underlying mechanisms include reductions in market expansion and innovation input. Our findings are more pronounced for firms connected to the United States and those suffering financial distress and for non-state-owned enterprises. We further contribute to the literature by showing that firms with developed managerial ability, more confident managers, and better corporate social responsibility performance tend to increase innovation for competitiveness in response to the trade war.

In Ethiopia, prior studies overlooked this concept when studying entrepreneurial marketing practices (EMP) in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This study aimed to investigate the effect of these practices on the BSD. Employing a mixed-methods approach, primary and secondary data from 387 SMEs (selected via stratified and simple random sampling from 5765) are analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results demonstrate a significant, positive relationship between EMP such as innovativeness, opportunity focus, value creation, proactiveness, and sustainable development. The study underscores the necessity for SMEs to enhance marketing practices to ensure long-term viability and competitiveness. It highlights stakeholder engagement: policymakers, local communities, and consumers as critical for aligning marketing efforts with sustainability goals. This engagement not only meets consumer expectations for ethically driven businesses but also enhances inclusive growth and community welfare. By promoting dialogue among stakeholders, SMEs drive sustainable development initiatives and advocate for policies supporting environmentally and socially responsible practices, contributing to a greener, socially conscious economy. Future research should explore mediating or moderating variables across different SME types and regions. This study's novelty lies in its insights into how EMP impact SME sustainable development within Ethiopia, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making and highlighting the pivotal role of entrepreneurial marketing (EM) in achieving long-term success in dynamic markets. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","entrepreneurial marketing; SMEs; stakeholders' engagement; sustainable development","","A.T.

In this sense, the information that companies report on their energy strategy is essential to understand and value business interest and efforts to contribute to the protection of ecosystems and human life on the planet. In this regard, the aim of this article is to analyse the role that women directors are playing in business transparency in energy matters and whether their role is determined by the level of gender parity that characterizes the countries of origin of the companies analysed. The academic and practical interest in these relationships is based on various theoretical frameworks that indicate gender equality is closely associated with greater concern for systems and elements in situations of real vulnerability, generating organizational changes aligned with these concerns. For a sample of 8757 companies based in 65 countries, we observed that gender parity at the country level positively affects the information that companies report regarding their energy transition strategy towards more responsible models that help mitigate climate change. We also identified a mediating effect of board gender diversity on this relationship. The findings are robust to changes in methodological specifications. This evidence confirms the existence of a direct and indirect impact of equal development between women and men in a society on the energy transition and business inclusivity. Additionally, although these relationships are observed for the entire period analysed (2016–2022), the effect of the disruptive phenomena that occurred between 2020 and 2022 favours both business transformations and inclusivity. © 2024 The Authors","Board of directors; Decarbonization; Energy transition; Gender diversity; Gender equality","Boards of directors; Business changes; Business transformations; Decarbonisation; Energy; Energy strategy; Energy transitions; Gender diversity; Gender equality; Human lives","I.-M.

Many studies have highlighted the context, yet no reviews have explored the integration of FinTech and sustainability through the lens of the banking aspect. Therefore, this study sheds light on the literature trends associated with FinTech and sustainable banking using an integrated bibliometric and systematic literature review (SLR). The bibliometric analysis explored publication trends, keyword analysis, top publisher, and author analysis. With the SLR approach, we pondered the theory-context-characteristics-methods (TCCM) framework with 44 articles published from 2002 to 2023. The findings presented a substantial nexus between FinTech and sustainable banking, showing an incremental interest among global scholars. We also provided a comprehensive finding regarding the dominant theories (i.e., technology acceptance model and autoregressive distributed lag model), specific contexts (i.e., industries and countries), characteristics (i.e., independent, dependent, moderating, and mediating variables), and methods (i.e., research approaches and tools). This review is the first to identify the less explored tie between FinTech and sustainable banking. The findings may help policymakers, banking service providers, and academicians understand the necessity of FinTech in sustainable banking. The future research agenda of this review will also facilitate future researchers to explore the research domain to find new insights. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","FinTech; sustainable banking; sustainable development; systematic literature review; TCCM framework","","I.H.

The conceptual framework in company with hypothesis framing were established after examining the related literature. Data were gathered from a sample of 723 respondents in public sector organizations in South Vietnam via convenience sampling method. Structural equation modeling was employed to validate the goodness of model fit and examine the hypotheses. These findings revealed that integration of corporate social responsibility activities into the public sector scorecard management framework was significantly and positively related to the corporate social responsibility disclosure and organizational performance. Additionally, it also asserted that corporate social responsibility disclosure was considerably associated in a positive manner with organizational performance. Thus, some detailed implications in connection with each causal relationship and several orientations were underlined to ameliorate the capacity of managing and measuring the organizational corporate social responsibility practices in a strategic manner. © 2020 by the authors.","Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility disclosure; Organizational performance; Public sector scorecard","","P.Q.

SRI considers the corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria of firms is becoming an emerging topic in economics and management. The aim of this paper is to develop a hybrid SRI portfolio selection model with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) techniques. First, a multi-dimensional evaluation criteria system containing fundamental financial indicators, CSR criteria, and stock market factors, is put forward for SRI to make the decision results more comprehensive and applicable. Second, a multi-stage MCDM decision mechanism including the affinity propagation clustering (APC) algorithm, the best-worst method (BWM), and the MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of a Ratio Analysis plus the full MULTIplicative form) is implemented. The APC algorithm is used for the reduction of financial indicators. The BWM is applied to determine the financial and CSR criteria weights. The MULTIMOORA method is integrated to derive the financial and CSR performance of the firms. Third, a multi-objective SRI portfolio selection model adding financial, CSR, and stock market performance is constructed, which serves as an extension of the classical mean-variance model. The compromise solution is utilized when solving the MOOP. Finally, a case study related to the medical stock investment is examined to recommend the optimal portfolio allocation for investors. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are performed to demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed methodology. © 2022","Corporate social responsibility; Multi-criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Portfolio selection; Socially responsible investment","Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Corporate social responsibility; Investments portfolios; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Portfolio selection; Portfolio selection models; Socially responsible investments; Multiobjective optimization","X.

Regarding the group level of corporate governance, the efficacy of board committees (e.g., audit, compensation or CSR committees) has been included in recent research designs. However, analyses of corporate governance at the individual level are related to the effects of top management members [e.g., chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO) or chief sustainability officer (CSO)] on CSR outcomes. This paper aims to convey a detailed understanding of sustainable management control’s impact as CSR-related board expertise. In more detail, we focus on the influence of both CSR committees and CSOs on three CSR measures mainly analysed in empirical-quantitative research: (1) CSR reporting; (2) CSR assurance (CSRA); and (3) CSR performance. We motivate our analysis with increased relevance from practical, regulatory and research perspectives, and we employ a systematic literature review of the symbolic vs. substantive effects of sustainability-related board composition. Based on our theoretical model (legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory and upper-echelons theory), we selected 48 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies on this research topic. Our analysis shows that CSR committees positively influence CSR reporting and performance. Thus, there are indications that the implementation of a CSR committee is not a symbolic act, but instead substantively contributes to CSR activities. However, in light of inconclusive empirical research results and a lack of studies that have analysed CSO-related effects, a notable research gap has been identified. Moreover, we note the main limitations of prior research in this review and develop an agenda with useful recommendations for future studies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Board expertise; Chief sustainability officer (CSO); CSR assurance; CSR committee; CSR performance; CSR reporting","","P.

Digital transformation has an important impact on enterprise decision-making and environmental management. Based on panel data of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2011 to 2021, we empirically examine the relationship between digital transformation and greenwashing using a fixed-effects model. The results show that enterprise digital transformation can significantly inhibit greenwashing behavior. Second, the impact of enterprise digital transformation on greenwashing exhibits heterogeneous effects at the regional, industry, and firm levels. Furthermore, enterprise digital transformation suppresses greenwashing by alleviating financing constraints, improving information transparency, and enhancing internal control. In addition, we also find that there is an effective boundary to the impact of digital transformation on greenwashing. Specifically, digital transformation exerts a mitigating impact on enterprise greenwashing when the digital transformation level is lower than 10.2163 or higher than 15.7763.

We also find that the influence of the reported environmental sustainability practices on firm value is strongly and positively moderated by the presence of independent directors on firms’ boards, signifying that stakeholders relate environmental reporting by firms to more independent directors providing better accountability to environmental practices.

The potential moderating role of cash flow has also been studied in an effort to disentangle its relationships in this context. By using data on A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020 in China, we find that a good ESG performance has a significantly positive impact on FOE. After changing the measurement of FOE, using Huazheng ESG performance and a series of stability tests such as endogenous tests, the results are still robust. Meanwhile, we find that the primary driver of the positive impact of ESG on FOE lies in its capacity to enhance economies of scale. In addition, we also find that ESG has a more pronounced effect on FOE for non-manufacturing enterprises and privately-owned enterprises. These results suggest that ESG has become an effective way to improve FOE. Exploring the impact of ESG performance on corporate operational efficiency is of significant practical significance for getting rid of corporate development difficulties, promoting good business operation, advancing the upgrading of the industrial structure of the industry, and ultimately realizing the efficient and steady growth of the industry as a whole. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Cash flow; DEA-BCC; ESG; Firm operating efficiency; Spatial clustering","China; economic conditions; economic growth; firm size; industrial enterprise; industrial structure; private sector; spatiotemporal analysis","B.

Furthermore, it assesses the main limitations reported in previous CSRR studies and offers recommendations for best practice and future research. Design/methodology/approach: A review protocol was developed to search nine major databases over a decade (2005–2017) using specific keywords. As a result, 221 articles were identified that deal explicitly with CSRR in both developed and developing countries, and a descriptive analysis was undertaken. Findings: Findings of the review show that scholarly work on CSRR across the globe have increased exponentially. However, there still remain quite a few countries and industries that have been underrepresented in CSRR literature. Moreover, methodological- and sampling-related limitations have been noted by a number of scholars in the area. Based on these results, the review provides directions for future research. Originality/value: The review provides a categorised bibliography of CSRR research on developed and developing countries from 2005 to 2017, covering a range of journals and countries. The review provides state of the art of the CSRR research and highlights the major loopholes in the current literature.

The research also seeks to ascertain the factors that influence the development of business cooperation. Design/methodology/approach: The database used is the Community Innovation Survey (CIS, 2014) applied in the European Union (EU) during the time period 2012–2014. A sample of 7083 Portuguese firms were analyzed through the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results suggest that CSR positively relates with firms' innovation, and business cooperation partially mediates this relationship. The outcomes also reveal that investing in certain types of innovation activities increases the firms' willingness to cooperate. Originality/value: The findings contribute to encourage an open innovation strategy as an easy and effective way to cope with rapid trends and changes, since it demonstrates the complementary between innovation and cooperation, as sources of value creation. From a triple bottom line (TBL) perspective, it also highlights that CSR must include social, economic and environmental initiatives, and should be a part of the firms' innovation strategy. As a result, managers who intend to contribute for society in the long term should plan, monitor and manage all CSR dimensions. © 2021, Telma Mendes, Vítor Braga, Aldina Correia and Carina Silva.","Cooperation; Corporate social responsibility; Eco-innovation; Innovation","","T.

To address this concern, our paper contributes to the stream of literature that studies the content of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports (which are also referred to as non-financial statements, sustainability reports or parts of annual reports) using text mining methods. We present a novel approach called Standard-based Impact Classification method (SBIC method), which employs natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques to identify the types of social impacts reflected in CSR reports. We deploy a Random Forest model which we train on reports adhering to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, enabling the identification of social impact in the majority of CSR reports that do not conform to this standard. Our proposed SBIC method serves as a valuable tool for comparing the social impacts generated by firms, industries, or countries. We showcase an application of our approach by examining the relationship between a company's social impact and its innovation capacity. Our findings support the existing literature consensus that CSR activities generally exhibit a positive correlation with a firm's ability to innovate. Furthermore, we reveal that specific types of social impacts have a more pronounced influence on innovation capacity. © 2023 The Author(s)","Corporate social responsibility (CSR) report; CSR and innovation interconnection; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Machine learning; Natural language processing; Social impact","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility  report; Corporate social responsibility and innovation interconnection; Global Reporting Initiative; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social impact; Social innovations; Economic and social effects","I.

Although the number of NGOs adopting social reporting is increasing, research is still lacking on the relationships between firms and NGOs and their impacts at the government level, at which policy makers must both favour social/environmental commitments and ensure that NGOs pursue their core objectives, also when carrying out trading activities. This paper investigates the challenges of policy making in this field by analysing NGOs in Italy, the first country to make social reporting compulsory. We randomly selected 20 social reports from the Italian NGO register to analyse eight components regarding the disclosure of their impact. The results show that a compulsory requirement leads to a paradox, given the trade-off between stakeholder engagement principles on the one hand and disciplinary power and accounting as action at a distance principles on the other, leading NGOs to account for their output rather than for their impact. We thus contribute to the literature about NGOs and corporate social responsibility (CSR), delineating the relevance of a paradox perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to apply this perspective to the analysis of CSR and sustainable development trajectories in NGOs. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","corporate social responsibility; NGOs; social accounting reporting; social impact; stakeholder engagement; sustainable development","","P.

Within this context, innovation assumes a significant role in this challenge, particularly for smaller companies facing greater obstacles in fostering innovation. These constraints have prompted both internal and external innovation initiatives, commonly referred to as open innovation. In this article, we scrutinize the influence of environmental practices on innovation endeavors, specifically examining whether the innovation strategy and its implementation facilitate the advancement of open innovation within SMEs. Furthermore, we explore the potential moderating effect of firm owners' gender on these relationships. The research model is validated using data from 543 companies in Ecuador, employing the partial least squares (PLS) method. The findings elucidate how environmental sustainability can promote the adoption of open innovation practices, with the innovation strategy and its implementation acting as mediators in this relationship. The impact of gender only manifests in the innovation strategy pertaining to environmental sustainability. In conclusion, open innovation stemming from the pivotal role of environmental sustainability emerges as a critical driver in augmenting innovation performance across various dimensions, such as quality, growth, efficiency, process enhancement, organizational practices, employee motivation, and acquisition of new product/service skills. © 2023 The Authors","Environmental sustainability; Gender gap; Innovation; Open innovation; SMEs; Strategy","","M.

The study aims to identify the combinatory factors driving the adoption of Digital B2B platforms for managing cause-related B2B marketing programs. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an innovative approach of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on data collated from top corporations in India supporting cause-related B2B marketing programs. Sponsoring organisations and NPO dyads (i.e. survey both) filled out an email survey on 264 cause-related B2B marketing programs. Findings: The study establishes that the combination of technological, organisational and environmental factors would lead to the adoption of Digital B2B platforms in managing cause-related B2B marketing programs. The study identifies six combinations of these factors for adopting Digital B2B platforms within and across sponsoring organisations and NPOs. Practical implications: The study findings would aid cause-related B2B marketers in developing Digital B2B platforms’ capabilities by understanding the different combinations of factors driving adoption. Digital B2B platforms’ capabilities can improve market performance if developed as core competencies. Social implications: The study findings would enable improvements in the implementation and performance of cause-related B2B marketing programs. Better management of cause-related B2B marketing programs would help increase beneficiary coverage and the realisation of societal goals.

This study aims to examine the influence of the Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework on the disclosure of financial- and impact-material sustainability-related information in integrated reports. Design/methodology/approach: Using a disclosure index constructed from the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Guidelines and UN Sustainable Development Goals, the authors content analysed integrated reports of 40 companies from the International Integrated Reporting Council’s Pilot Programme Business Network published between 2015 and 2017. The content analysis distinguished between financial- and impact-material sustainability-related information. Findings: The extent of sustainability-related disclosures in integrated reports remained more or less constant over the study period. Impact-material disclosures were more prominent than financial material ones. Impact-material disclosures mainly related to environmental aspects, while labour practices-related disclosures were predominantly financially material. The balance between financially- and impact-material sustainability-related disclosures varied based on factors such as industry environmental sensitivity and country-specific characteristics, such as the country’s legal system and development status. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents a unique disclosure index to distinguish between financially- and impact-material sustainability-related disclosures. Researchers can use this disclosure index to critically examine the nature of sustainability-related disclosure in corporate reports. Practical implications: This study offers an in-depth understanding of the influence of non-financial reporting frameworks, such as the <IR> Framework that uses a financial materiality perspective, on sustainability reporting. The findings reveal that the practical implementation of the <IR> Framework resulted in sustainability reporting outcomes that deviated from theoretical expectations. Exploring the materiality concept that underscores sustainability-related disclosures by companies using the <IR> Framework is useful for predicting the effects of adopting the Sustainability Disclosure Standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board, which also emphasises financial materiality. Social implications: Despite an emphasis on financial materiality in the <IR> Framework, companies continue to offer substantial impact-material information, implying the potential for companies to balance both financial and broader societal concerns in their reporting. Originality/value: While prior research has delved into the practices of regulated integrated reporting, especially in the unique context of South Africa, this study focuses on voluntary adoption, attributing observed practices to intrinsic company motivations. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first study to explicitly explore the nature of materiality in sustainability-related disclosure. The research also introduces a nuanced understanding of contextual factors influencing sustainability reporting. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial materiality; Global Reporting Initiative; Impact materiality; Integrated reporting; Sustainability disclosure; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","","S.

As copper is a 100% recyclable material, much of the sector’s production comes from secondary copper, scrap, not from mined copper. In the case of La Farga, not only a good part of its output comes from recycled copper, but it is also a world leader in copper-recycling technology. The objective of the paper is to describe La Farga’s business model from the point of view of sustainability and the circular economy. What have been the causes and effects of recycling on the business model? Regarding the methodology, the work follows the research strategy of the case study. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from a variety of primary and secondary sources. Economic, social and environmental sustainability of the firm was assessed through financial and non-financial indicators; value-added generation and distribution were calculated from accounting data; and the circular business model was analysed via a thematic analysis: its components, innovation, enablers and barriers. Results show that the presence of barriers forces the implementation of circularity to be gradual and to combine linear and circular models to maintain competitiveness. © 2021 by the authors.

Then we propose that partnership restructure mediates the nexus between ECSR and firm performance because ECSR may motivate firms to change their partners in the better interests of the firms. In addition, we propose that the firms’ industry power will exaggerate while dysfunctional competition will weaken the positive nexus between ECSR and partnership restructure.

Philosophers, economists and even religious people have wanted to contribute their grain of sand to the study of the ethical behaviour of companies and make it go beyond mere administration. In recent years, non-financial reporting has been gaining ground, to the point that the legal system now makes it compulsory in most Western countries. Purpose of the article: This study aims to review and summarize the role of ethics in the sustainability reporting so as to develop a holistic framework of ethics in the sustainability reporting; review the evolution of the research field; and identify the most significant research tendencies enabling the proposal of several future research directions. Methods: Using the Scopus and Web of Science databases, a bibliometric analysis has been carried out in the field of accounting on this topic from its formal origins in the 1980s to the present day, in addition to highlighting the importance of sustainability. 271 articles have been used as a basis for developing the main trends at bibliographic, geographical and institutional levels. Findings & value added: This study highlights the importance of incorporating ethics in nonfinancial information as a field of research, through two very different lines of research that have gained importance in recent years: ethics in business and the growing relevance of nonfinancial information. It also incorporates a bibliometric analysis with information obtained from two major databases: Scopus and Web of Science. The use of both databases makes it possible to broaden the body of articles covered, compared to other bibliometric analyses previously carried out on similar topics, and allows for the inclusion of more relevant articles on this subject. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).","bibliometric analysis; corporate social responsibility; ethics; social accounting; sustainability reporting","","V.C.

However, how and under what conditions corporate social responsibility activities influence green innovation performance in emerging economies is still unclear. From the perspective of the theory of planned behavior, we construct a theoretical model to assess how corporate social responsibility activities affect enterprises’ green innovation performance. Explicitly, we investigate the mediating and moderating effects of managerial environmental concern and green absorptive capacity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility activities and enterprises’ green innovation performance. This research relies on a sample of 358 enterprises from the manufacturing and service sectors in China, and uses regression analysis and bootstrap to test the hypotheses proposed. The empirical results demonstrate that (1) corporate social responsibility activities positively enhance enterprises’ green innovation performance; (2) corporate social responsibility activities have a positive influence on managerial environmental concern; (3) managerial environmental concern has a mediating role between corporate social responsibility activities and green innovation performance; (4) managerial environmental concern has a powerful influence on green innovation performance; (5) green absorptive capacity positively moderates the association between managerial environmental concern and green innovation performance. This research work proposes that managerial environmental concern and green absorptive capacity play a mediating and moderating function on the linkage amongst corporate social responsibility activities and green innovation performance.

Our thorough analysis demonstrates that strong corporate governance standards, including board independence, ownership structure, and composite governance scores, have a beneficial influence on Return on Assets (ROA) and stock price. Environmental performance emerges as a driver of financial success, confirming the link between environmentally friendly behaviors and financial success. Furthermore, research and development (R&D) spending has been shown to improve financial success. Corporate governance has been regarded as a driver for innovation, creating a creative culture. Furthermore, innovation serves as a bridge between corporate governance and financial success. The link between corporate governance and financial success is mediated by environmental performance. Further investigation reveals that innovation has a moderating effect on the association between financial results and environmental performance.

The contributive concept of vigorous board has been formulated through data employment analysis while contemplating the seven attributes such as board meetings, non-duality, number of external directors, number of supervisors, audit committee member, the presence of female among board members, and incumbent CEO education. Significantly, the data of Romanian manufacturing firms have been accumulated for the years 2009–2019. To contemplate with deep insight, the moderating impact of environmental disclosure, environmental performance, green innovation, and innovation output has been accentuated for firm performance. Empirical underpinnings signify that environmental performance and green innovation are the catalytic moderators for escalating the firms’ performance under the aegis of vigorous board. Furthermore, environmental disclosure also increases the growth of Romanian companies, while innovation output remains stagnant. Under the aegis of upper echelon theory, theoretical contribution has been signified while emphasizing on environmental situation of Romanian firms. Remarkably, the moment quantile regression method demonstrates the long-term and short-term influence of the vigorous board, the size of the firms and the total sales, while the leverage and age of the CEO mitigate the firm performance in the short term. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Environmental disclosure; Environmental performance; Firms; Green innovation; Innovation output; Performance; Vigorous board","firm size; green economy; innovation; manufacturing","L.

Since no globally accepted definition of what social sustainability encompasses exists, the paper asks how social sustainability is translated into the financial market language by SARIs as they provide standards for disclosing corporate non-financial performance and promote their concepts of social sustainability. The paper uses a two-step qualitative content analysis. First, it operationalizes social sustainability based on the empirical data of six sustainability rating agencies. Second, this operationalization is compared with the concepts created by three SARIs. The paper shows significant differences between the concepts of the SARIs and the rating agencies. While the rating agencies altogether interpret social sustainability with 83 distinct aspects, the SARIs, although differently created, use significant reduced concepts where 20% of these aspects are absent. The result of this financialization process could be a simplified and financially determined concept of social sustainability within die socially discourse. The research is limited to social sustainability and its financialization by SARIs. Individual indicators and their way or intensity to capture aspects of social sustainability were not part of the research interest. Further research should investigate the economic and the ecological pillars of sustainability as well as the usage of such financialized concepts within the society and especially by corporations. The paper unfolds the arbitrariness of operationalizing a qualitative phenomenon like social sustainability through the financial system. It discloses the need for looking at the mechanisms behind such processes and at the interests of the actors behind the frameworks. The paper reveals the financialization process driven by SARIs and demonstrates its simplifying effects on the concept of social sustainability. Furthermore, the paper shows that SARIs as metrics for non-financial aspects are troubled with a lack of transparency and a lack of convergence. © 2020 CONVIVIUM, association loi de 1901.","financialization; social and environmental accounting; social and environmental reporting; social sustainability; sustainability disclosure","","D.

This study explores the pivotal role of heterogeneous digital innovation in improving corporate environment, society, and governance (ESG) performance to investigate the compatibility path between enterprise digitalization and sustainable development. Compared to previous literature, this paper adopts patent data provided by IPC to identify corporate digital technology innovation, evaluating the influence of digital innovation on corporate ESG performance with a specific focus on inherent innovation motivation. Based on a sample of Chinese listed companies from 2012 to 2021, the study reveals a significant enhancement of digital technology innovation in corporate ESG performance, verifying that substantive digital innovation can stimulate higher ESG performance. Digital technology innovation operates mainly by stimulating green innovation and improving information disclosure quality. The Governance pillar benefits the most among each ESG pillar, whereas there is no evidence that symbolic digital innovation can boost the Environment pillar. Furthermore, the study highlights the vital roles played by intellectual property protection and corporate innovation-oriented strategy, which can amplify the positive impacts of digital technology innovation, especially substantive innovation, on ESG performance. Moreover, substantive digital innovation can inhibit corporate greenwashing, while symbolic innovation cannot. These findings contribute to fresh micro-level evidence of the non-economic implications of the digital economy, providing novel insights into the intricate interplay between digital technology innovation and ESG performance through a process-oriented lens, offering cogent policy recommendations to foster increased business engagement in ESG activities. © 2024","Digital technology innovation; ESG; Substantive innovation; Symbolic innovation","","Z.

Yet, established technology adoption theories offer limited tools for characterizing business AI integration and analyzing its effects. These primarily focus on the factors facilitating or hindering adoption, rather than on adoption patterns and impacts. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to address this key gap and applies it to the case of the ESG rating industry. ESG raters play a pivotal role in sustainable finance, providing metrics that guide investment decisions globally. However, little is known about the extent and nature of their AI usage and its implications. Through a mixed-methods approach combining the analysis of job postings, patent filings, research publications, and corporate websites, we examine AI adoption among major ESG raters. Our investigation explores the specific AI technologies employed, their functional applications, the innovations developed, the intensity of AI integration, and the potential impacts of raters' AI adoption. Our results reveal widespread and growing AI adoption across the industry. Our findings show that raters extensively leverage Natural Language Processing to streamline data collection, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, they have pioneered Machine Learning innovations that significantly expand their sustainability assessment capabilities in various domains. These findings mark a considerable departure from prior academic and gray literature that characterized major ESG raters as having minimal AI use, prompting critical questions regarding the implications of this technological transformation for ESG ratings' reliability, transparency, and potential biases. © 2024 The Author(s).

An open-pit mining method is more often used in the early years of such a mining enterprise (ME). The management of the enterprise is faced with the problem of changing the mining method as the depth of the quarry increases. Untimely solution of this issue or the choice of the wrong strategy for the development of ME leads to a decrease in profitability, and the emergence of environmental and social difficulties. We studied the functioning of one hundred and seven MEs from different countries and substantiated four main sustainable development strategies for ME and its main system—the open-pit mining and technical system (MTS): adjustment of the current stage of mining indicators, transition to a new stage of mining, transition to a combined open–underground mining, and mine clo-sure. The result of our research is an original methodology for selecting a strategy for MTS sustainable development. Our methodology is based on a new system of parameters and indicators for evaluating the sustainability of the opening-up of an opencast system (OOS). This assessment system includes twenty-three indicators that characterize the technical, technological, economic, social, and environmental factors of sustainable development. We propose to select a strategy for MTS sustainable development using combined fuzzy AHP-MARCOS multicriteria decision method (MCDM). The result of our case study for the Malyi Kuibas ore deposit was the choice of a mine closure strategy. The reliability of the obtained result is confirmed by a multilateral sensitivity assessment using nine other known MCDMs, while changing the criteria weights and composition of strategies. The results of the study prove the need for a timely decision to change the MTS development strategy as the depth of production increases. In addition, we have shown the effectiveness of the selection methodology based on the multicriteria assessment of the OOS sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes data from 75 firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2020. The CSR/sustainability reporting quality is assessed using a scoring system ranging from 0 to 2. An interaction analysis is conducted using Panel Ordered Logit Regression to examine the moderating effect of CSR committees on the relationship between board attributes and CSR/sustainability reporting quality. Findings: The analysis reveals significant positive impacts of board expertise and attendance on CSR/sustainability reporting quality. The presence of a CSR committee significantly enhances reporting practices. However, board size has a nonsignificant impact on its own. In the presence of a CSR committee, board size becomes positively associated with reporting quality, but this effect is moderated by a negative interaction. Furthermore, the presence of a CSR committee attenuates the positive impact of board attendance. Despite this moderating role, the effect of board attendance remains positive and significant. Conversely, the CSR committee has a nonsignificant moderating effect on board expertise. Practical implications: The findings emphasize the importance for Saudi Arabian companies to strategically develop boards with strong CSR expertise and actively involve CSR committees in overseeing CSR activities. This strategic integration is crucial for enhancing the quality of CSR/sustainability reporting, fostering transparency and accountability and facilitating informed decision-making. Social implications: By implementing these governance practices, Saudi Arabian companies can strengthen stakeholder trust and contribute to sustainable economic and societal progress within the country.

This study aims to examine how board gender diversity (BGD) affects corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and the moderating factors that influence the relationship. There is a lack of research on the moderating indicators (variable measurement, geographic location, data sets and gender parity score) that impact the BGD and CSR relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses content analysis and meta-analysis to combine the findings of 44 selected papers published from 2010 to 2019, comprehensively reviewing the academic literature on gender diversity in the board composition. Independent and dependent variables are classified based on the variable measurement; this study examines the moderator indicators, such as geographical location, research data sets and gender parity score to investigate the BGD and CSR relationship. Findings: The findings indicated a significant positive relationship between BGD and CSR performance. The meta-method results showed that the measurements of BGD and CSR limited to impact on the relationship. But a significant moderating effect of the geographical location on the BGD-CSR relationship, the BGD-CSR relationship would be stronger in the firms located in North America than firms located in Asia and other areas. Empirical results also showed a significant moderating effect of gender parity score. There would be stronger BGD-CSR relations in the firms located in the countries with higher gender parity score than the firms located in the countries with low gender parity score. This means the female status is an essential indicator of moderating the BGD-CSR relationship. Research limitations/implications: The main shortcoming is a lack of sufficient articles on the BGD-CSR relationship. In a future study, researchers may use other databases, such as Google scholar or Ebscohost, to increase the number of relevant articles. These studies would offer new insight into the meta-analysis of the relationship between the BGD and CSR. Finally, the authors identify the potential trend in future research, future research on BGD will need for standardized metrics. The Geographic location is an important indicator that will influence the female director role in CSR. A systematic measure and data of gender research are more important for study in this field. Practical implications: Meta-analysis is conducted on the independent and dependent variables to examine the causality between BGD and CSR performance, which could better explore diversity among different countries’ boards and, more generally, to investigate the degree to which diversity may influence CSR. Firms may try to balance the BGD to improve future development prospects. Specifically, the results of this study have important implications for corporate governance and policymakers. Social implications: First, this systematic study uses meta-analysis to combine the findings of previous research on the BGD-CSR. The current research attempts to incorporate mixed empirical results based on the different variable measurements. Second, this study develop and test a contingency model of female on boards and CSR that considers uses the geographic location factors that may enhance or diminish the influence of female on boards on CSR. Specifically, the authors examine whether and under what conditions, boards with more female directors differ for inter-country heterogeneity to which they engage in monitoring roles and are involved with strategy management. Originality/value: First, this study could be the first systematic study that uses the meta-analysis to combine previous research findings on the BGD-CSR. Second, the current research attempts to incorporate mixed empirical results based on the different variable measurements.

Particularly, we analyzed the influence of sustainability-related issues of the board of directors (BDs) on firm environmental disclosure, after the mandatory preparation of integrated reporting (IR). In addition, we also examined indepth whether some corporate social policies are able to condition the foregoing disclosure. The empirical study covers the period from 2010 (the first-time adoption of IR in South Africa) to 2015 (the earliest year of the release process regarding King Code of Governance Principles for South Africa 2009 (i.e., King III). Data were collected by the Bloomberg database. With reference to the BDs features, great attention was paid to both business ethics policy and CEO duality. Instead, with regard to corporate social issues, we looked into the adoption of the policies pertaining to health and safety and the respect for human rights. Following the mandatory preparation of IR, our findings show a positive relationship between business ethics policy and firm environmental disclosure. Contrarily, CEO duality does not exert any effect over the earlier type of corporate reporting. Furthermore, empirical evidence substantiates the association between health safety and human rights policies that are very crucial in an emerging economy, such as South Africa, and firm environmental disclosure. The rationale of such results arguably resides in compliance with King III. Therefore, this study can provide interesting insights, given that its mandatory adoption might reveal an important turning point in the development of corporate governance codes, as well as being a ""driver"" for potential enhancements of firm environmental disclosure, inter alia, in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.6. © 2020 by the authors.

A sample of 87 published papers is used to identify a set of underlying moderating effects in that relationship. Specifically, differences in the system of corporate governance, CSP measurement models and market conditions have been considered as moderating variables. The results show that the independence of a company's board positively influences CSP. This is because companies with more independent directors in their boards are more likely to commit to stakeholder engagement, environmental preservation and community well-being. Interestingly, the results also show that the positive connection between board independence and CSP is stronger in civil law countries and when CSP is measured by self-reporting data. Finally, the strength of the influence of the independence of a firm's board on CSP varies significantly in different market conditions. The paper concludes by presenting the main implications for academics, practitioners and policy makers. © 2017 by the authors.","Board independence; Corporate governance; Corporate social performance; Meta-analysis","antisocial behavior; civil rights; corporate strategy; independence; industrial regulation; market conditions; meta-analysis; stakeholder","E.

Using Python, we collected data from Chinese manufacturing firms from 2009 to 2020. This study used the ordinary least squares method to examine the relationships among DT, ESG performance, and manufacturing ESG heterogeneity. The results suggest that big companies and growing firms pay more attention to their ESG performance than others and that state-owned enterprises are keen on ESG performance but underperform. Additionally, DT may contribute to manufacturing ESG performance in general; labor-intensive and non-state-owned enterprises benefit more from DT than their counterparts; and manufacturers in economically developed regions show more significant ESG performance thanks to DT. These findings support the use of a DESG theoretical framework in the manufacturing industry whereby digital technologies facilitate business production and improve the business profits of manufacturing firms, so that manufacturers have sufficient profits to conduct ESG investments for sustainable development in a virtuous cycle.

This study investigates the relationship between board diversity attributes and CSR disclosure, as well as the various cultural conditions influencing board diversity–CSR disclosure relationships through meta-analysis based on data from 45 empirical studies. We discovered that board diversity attributes such as board gender, age, education, and national diversity have a positive relationship with CSR disclosure. In terms of moderating effects, we discovered that cultural dimensions of (high) uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and (high) indulgence positively moderate the relationship between board diversity attributes and CSR disclosure, whereas high individualism, masculinity, and power distance scores negatively moderate these relationships. This study highlights the importance of maintaining diversity in terms of age, gender, education, and nationality at the board level in promoting CSR disclosures, even in restraining cultures, suggesting policymakers devise policies that encourage board diversity. Academically, this study extends the previous meta-work by clarifying the strength and direction of the relationships between board diversity attributes and CSR disclosure, helping to resolve ambiguities in these relationships in the extant literature. In addition, the study explores the moderating effects of cultural dimensions on the relationship between board diversity and CSR disclosure, a factor that was previously overlooked. © 2025 The Author(s).

The level of CSR among sample firms was assessed using a multidimensional financial approach. The random-effect model was employed to test the study’s hypotheses. The findings support the dysfunctional view of the role of the board of directors’ in family-owned businesses. Overall, board size and CEO duality have a significant negative impact on CSR, whereas board independence has a significant positive impact. While these findings applied to both family-owned and non-family-owned businesses. It was discovered that among family-owned businesses, boards tend to look after the interests of family members, and thus are less likely to support CSR.

Nowadays, the application of big data technology may have a significant impact on firms' ESG performance, but research in this area remains relatively insufficient. Based on the quasi-natural experiment of the national big data comprehensive experimental zone pilot policy (NBDCEZs) in China, this study employs panel data from 1383 Chinese nonfinancial listed firms from 2009 to 2022. We utilize the difference-in-differences (DID) method to explore the impact of big data development on ESG performance. The results indicate that the implementation of the NBDCEZs has a significant positive effect on enhancing firms' ESG performance. The mechanism analysis suggests that the policy effectively improves firms' ESG performance by strengthening information disclosure quality and alleviating financing constraints. Additionally, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the positive effects of big data development are more pronounced in state-owned firms, firms with higher financial risk, and regions with lower levels of informatization.

The stakeholder engagement (SE) process represents a good practice of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and, at the same time, an aspect of substance over form, within the CSR policies. In spite of its relevance, SE represents a little explored field of research. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if the improvements in SE processes are actually driven by regulation rather than by some elements of corporate governance. The study examines the effect of the regulation and some board's characteristics on SE. Specifically, in 2017 the introduction of EU non-financial information Directive (Directive 2014/95/EU) shifts the disclosure of non-financial information from the voluntary to the mandatory realm: in this mandatory context, the quality of the SE process that is indirectly disclosed in non-financial information, could improve. By using a content and statistical analysis, through performing 4 two-way Analysis of Variance, the study reveals that the effects of the introduction of the Directive 2014/95/EU on the stakeholder engagement process have been limited and the improvements in SE before and after the introduction of the Directive link to the Board of Directors characteristics. These findings are interesting for academics, by enriching the academic debate on mandatory versus voluntary disclosure and the relationship between board attributes and sustainability, for policy makers, by providing suggestions to favour organisational change of the firms, and for managers, by identifying the desirable characteristics of the Board of Directors. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","board structure; mandatory/voluntary information; NF directive; stakeholder engagement","","R.

Using a sample of Chinese listed companies during 2010–2018, this paper empirically examines the relation between corporate sustainable development performance, investor sentiment, and managerial overconfidence with econometric tools such as panel data regression and S-GMM estimation. Three kinds of corporate sustainable development activities as measured by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indexes, including consumer rights, employee benefits, and environmental protection, are proved to have a positive impact on investor sentiment. Compared to the SME and GEM Board, investor sentiment in the Main Board is less affected by corporate sustainable development. Furthermore, investor’s high sentiment leads to high managerial confidence in the SME and GEM Board, and managerial overconfidence is self-correcting over time. This paper illustrates why maintaining good corporate sustainable development performance is beneficial for listed companies from a new perspective. © 2022 by the authors.","corporate social responsibility; corporate sustainable development; investor sentiment; managerial overconfidence","business development; corporate social responsibility; panel data; regression; sustainable development","X.

There is a unique government-led green publicity institution, ‘Xuanguan‘, that expects to accelerate the green idea and policy spread top-down in the economic system in China. However, few studies discussed its role in formulating corporate green behavior. By constructing an integrated model of Government-led publicity-Internal and external perception-Corporate green behavior, this paper explored the effect of government-led green publicity on corporate green behavior, based on the survey data of 199 industrial manufacturing corporations in Henan Province, China. A structural equation model (SEM) was adopted to detect the influence and influential path. The results found that government-led green publicity could positively enhance green behavior via improving the corporate internal perception of risk and opportunity and improving the corporate perception of external environment actors. The heterogeneity tests showed that type of publicity channels, corporate ownership, and corporate scale made different effects on the results. Further analysis proved that government-led publicity could enhance the function of formal environmental regulation. It implies that government-led publicity can be a good compensation for formal regulations and stimulate green behavior. This paper demonstrates a new factor of enhancing corporate behavior and contributed new evidence of China’s green development story. © 2022 by the authors.

We focus on green innovation implementation (GII) and argue that GII is a distinctive strategic process. Traditional innovation implementation, centered on short-term economic growth, can be problematic as it often decouples nature from innovation in the pursuit of profit maximization. Thus, the traditional approach fails to adequately explain GII, specifically, who implements it and how they do it. We adopt a strategy-as-practice perspective and conduct a systematic review of 224 journal articles across various management fields to synthesize existing knowledge of GII. This review makes three main contributions. First, we posit that GII is theoretically distinct with unique implementation challenges: recoupling nature with innovation implementation introduces complex antecedents and environment-inclusive benefits, requiring a long-term implementation process and a broader scope. Second, we develop a framework that synthesizes practitioners, antecedents, processes, and impact of GII from three theoretical foci: (1) resource-based perspective, (2) sustainable value-driven perspective, and (3) institutional perspective. This framework complements the traditional understanding of innovation implementation by offering diverse theoretical insights on GII. Third, we propose theoretical and methodological directions for future research to advance knowledge on green innovation and provide meaningful insights on GII. © The Author(s) 2025.","Environment-inclusive benefits; environmental sustainability; green growth/economy; innovation; resource overuse/depletion; strategy implementation; sustainable values; systems thinking","","X.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of ESG performance on OFDI is more significant for enterprises with a high degree of digital transformation, containing foreign equity, operating in industries. The study concludes that better ESG performance bolsters corporate OFDI willingness through two distinct mechanisms. These mechanisms include alleviating financing constraints and lowering the productivity threshold. Additionally, better ESG performance not only increases the scale of OFDI but also fosters the binary marginal expansion of OFDI.

While a state-owned firm from a state with a high home country environmental profile will have a more positive effect on a firm's environmental proactivity, internationalization will weaken it, since the firm will encounter higher complexity when translating its green actions into a more global institutional context. In addition, when internationalization involves a very different host country environmental profile, the greater institutional distance seems to modify the influence of state ownership on environmental proactivity.

However, the high risk and intensive resource requirements make VC challenging, motivating venture capitalists (VCs) to form network communities to alleviate risk and share resources. VC network communities are involved in a dynamic process that depends upon member turnover. This study investigates the VC network communities from the investors' movement across VC network communities' perspective and examines this movement behavior on their VC performance, measured by the enterprises' innovation. We found that the investors' movement across network communities has an inverted U-shape effect on enterprises' innovation. In addition, the experience of the VCs and the higher level of clustering of the network community make the inverted U-shape curve steeper and make the turning point to the left. Our findings urge VCs to utilize the advantages from both intra- and extra-network communities and consider their stability and mobility, especially when they are more experienced and the network community has a higher clustering level. Therefore, their investment performance, in terms of the enterprise's innovation, can be enhanced. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Enterprise innovation; Network community; Venture capital; Venture capitalists' movement","Investments; Clusterings; Economic prosperity; Enterprise innovation; Innovation performance; Network communities; Resource requirements; U shape; Venture Capital; Venture capitalist' movement; Venture capitalists; Economics","X.

Cattle breeding programs have historically been focused on generating profit by selecting for high-producing animals and broadened to include traits related to health, reproduction, fertility, and efficiency. Now, cattle industries around the world are using genetics to reduce their environmental impacts and improve sustainability. Reducing emissions is vital to improve sustainability, and industry leaders have set emission goals to either reduce gross emissions, lower emissions intensity, or reach net-zero. However, additional traits should also be measured and compared in terms of their impact on the broader definition of sustainability. In addition to environmental impact, a sustainable breeding objective must consider profit, animal welfare, farmer wellbeing, and social responsibility. Traits to be considered include direct emissions (e.g. nitrogen and methane), production efficiency (e.g. feed efficiency, growth), closer to biology reproduction and fertility (e.g. oestrous strength and semen quality), health (e.g. calf and transition cow health) and welfare traits (e.g. polled). Many of these novel traits require labour-intensive or expensive phenotyping, resulting in small datasets and low reliability of estimated breeding values. Opportunities exist to overcome this limitation by utilising international collaboration to build large data bases, develop inexpensive and easy-to-measure proxy traits, and expand novel-phenotype reference populations by using female-driven reference populations and young stock and males. Non-economic values can be estimated that quantify the impact that a trait has on societal perspective (e.g. farmer preference) or the environmental impact (methane emissions), and combined with economic weights to calculate aggregate weights for each trait. While validation techniques are still uncertain, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals may be applied to determine the improvement in sustainability due to genetic selection. This approach allows for various perspectives of sustainability, such as in the developed versus developing world, to be considered. The number and quality of relevant phenotypes are currently the main limiting factors. As confidence continues to grow in the opportunity to improve sustainability through genetic selection, substantial new investment will be required both in phenotyping activities, but also into novel breeding structures and scheme designs that can maximise the value and impact of these phenotypes.  © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","adaptation; adoption of technology; animal breeding; economics; emissions; environment; genetics; greenhouse gas; modelling: cattle; sustainability","cattle; livestock farming; phenotype; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability","C.M.

Before this new standard is implemented effectively, the Institute of Indonesia Chartered Accountants (IAI), the Indonesia Task Force on Comprehensive Corporate Reporting (CCR) leader, recognised the importance of harmonising this standard’s key disclosure indicators with Indonesian regulations and business characteristics. In this case, input from various constituencies may be required, particularly regarding the mechanism that enables entities with varying capabilities and levels of preparation to apply this new standard. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop weighted and applicable climate-related disclosure indicators. We use the Delphi method to achieve this objective by involving several experts representing various user groups that influence accounting standard formulation in Indonesia. The Delphi method is a decision-making tool that establishes an effective communication process, facilitating complex problem solving. This study finalised 44 climate-related disclosure indicators based on the results of two Delphi rounds. Overall, 48% (21/44) of climate-related disclosure indicators were identified to be highly applicable. Among these high-relevance indicators, there were 10% (2/21) Governance, 24% (5/21) Strategy, 42% (9/21) Risk Management, and 24% (5/21) Metrics and Targets indicators. Additionally, around 20% (9/44) of climate-related disclosure indicators received 100% approval from the experts. Along with various essential implications, we argue that these results provide useful additional information for the national standard setter for the climate-related disclosure standard that are efficient and less burdensome to entities. © 2023 by the authors.","applicable indicators; climate-related disclosure; Delphi method; Indonesia; the national standard setting process","Indonesia; communication; Delphi analysis; environmental indicator; spatiotemporal analysis","P.B.

It can be defined as a series of management activities to improve environmental performance throughout the business process and simultaneously achieve profitability and sustainability. Accordingly, businesses are now abandoning the existing management philosophy that economic and environmental feasibility are inevitably in conflict and establishing strategies and methods to achieve both. Meanwhile, industry affects the business performance of individual companies. Since the performance of a company tends to be influenced by the intensity of competition in an industry, it is necessary to analyze the structural factors that determine the intensity of competition in an industry in order to predict the future performance of a company. Therefore, we studied how environmental management affects corporate performance given the level of industry competition. The results are as follows. First, environmental management positively impacts corporate performance. Second, a high level of competition within an industry moderates the relationship between environmental management and corporate performance. By verifying the influence of the industry to which a company belongs, that is, the level of competition within the industry, we confirm that a company’s environmental management can be used strategically to gain a competitive advantage. With the finding that the impact of a company’s environmental practices differs by industry in line with the degree of competition, we expect this study to be helpful for future research into strategic ESG activities. © 2023 by the authors.","corporate performance; environmental management; ESG; industry competition; industry concentration","business; environmental management; industrial enterprise; management practice; strategic approach; sustainability","J.W.

We show that such generally accepted and recommended concepts may not always work, specifically within Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Based on the foundations of stakeholder theory, we surprisingly reject hypotheses expecting positive effects of boards' gender diversity on SMEs' green behaviors. Compared to the research to date, we newly examine the effect of the frequency of manager–employee meetings on SMEs' green behaviors. We show that SMEs' implementation of PES and ECM requires a different frequency of employee engagements. In addition, we confirm that the presence of environmental managers is fruitful for the implementation of PES in family firms. We also reveal that family firms' ECM is significantly triggered by energy taxes, but also by the owners' gender diversity. By linking the managerial perspective including employees' engagement and PES with the technical discipline of ECM, this study provides several theoretical and practical implications. © 2024 The Authors.

The findings show: (1) CSR has a negative impact on GTI quantity and quality, with the impact on GTI quantity more severe. (2) Such hindering effects are caused by reduced R&D investment and increased internal control. (3) CSR's impediment of GTI is particularly significant among SOEs, high-tech, and non-high polluting firms. These conclusions remain robust after using alternative CSR measurements, Poisson/Probit regression model, instrumental variable test, and excluding the exogenous influence of COVID-19.

The paper summarizes the results of 128 publications across twelve different themes. European consumers are increasingly buying and drinking lower strength alcohol products over time, with some two fifths doing so to drink less alcohol. It tends to be younger more socially advantaged men, and existing heavier buyers and drinkers of alcohol, who take up lower strength alcohol products. Substitution leads to a lower number of grams of alcohol bought and drunk. Although based on limited studies, buying and drinking lower strength products do not appear to act as gateways to buying and drinking higher strength products. Producer companies are increasing the availability of lower strength alcohol products, particularly for beer, with extra costs of production offset by income from sales. Lower strength alcohol products tend to be marketed as compliments to, rather than substitutes of, existing alcohol consumption, with, to date, the impact of such marketing not evaluated. Production of lower strength alcohol products could impair the impact of existing alcohol policy through alibi marketing (using the brand of lower strength products to promote higher strength products), broadened normalization of drinking cultures, and pressure to weaken policies. In addition to increasing the availability of lower strength products and improved labelling, the key policy that favours substitution of higher strength alcohol products with lower strength products is an alcohol tax based on the dose of alcohol across all products. © 2022 by the authors.","household purchase data; lower strength alcohol products; realist review; substitution","Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Beverages; Beer; Commerce; Humans; Male; Policy Making; Public Policy; alcohol consumption; beer; consumer attitude; controlled study; cost; income; marketing; public policy; purchasing; Review; alcoholic beverage; beer; commercial phenomena; drinking behavior; human; male; management; public policy","P.

Various factors, including technological advances, environmental standards and social conditions, influence it. This paper investigates the complex dynamics of such interconnected factors shaping their internationalization strategies.

Findings: The study unveils a complex interplay between the different factors wherein high environmental and social attentions, along with balanced digital technology adoption, give the best international outcomes for new ventures. Our results show that positive internationalization results with higher organizational legitimacy but moderate use of digital technology. This nuanced perspective contests conventional wisdom, demonstrating the need for a thoughtful approach integrating technological expertise with sustainability imperatives. Practical implications: This study establishes a nuanced understanding of how new ventures should approach technological investments and promote environmental and social concerns. This research can help owners/managers to commit sufficient investment in digital resources and ESG-related projects.

Healthy food consumers are a conscious and demanding segment that values the quality and benefits they receive from a product and the ethical, environmental, and social impact of their purchasing decisions. The objective of the research is to evaluate the influence of perceived value components on health food brand image and brand loyalty in an emerging market. Methods: A cross-sectional and explanatory study was conducted considering 612 consumers of a healthy brand in Peru. The participants included women (65.2%) and men (34.8%), with ages between 18 and 56 (M = 22.56; SD = 5.95). Data were collected using a self-report form and statistically analyzed using PLS-SEM. Results: The study hypotheses confirmed the impact of perceived emotional value, perceived social value, perceived financial value, and perceived quality on brand image and loyalty. However, the proposed model observes that perceived social value has no impact on brand loyalty. Conclusion: Implementing strategies that help build stronger, healthy brands is part of effective management for business leaders. In this context, the findings indicate that brands should effectively communicate their attributes and offer them that meet and exceed consumer expectations to achieve consumer loyalty. This is a mechanism to consolidate a strong and positive image that facilitates customer loyalty based on perceived value.

However, research on their ESG activities and performance is complex, multi-layered, and currently lacks integration. This review aims to bridge these research disciplines by providing an integrative overview of the current state of family firm ESG literature. By systematically reviewing 127 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and mid-2024, I examine the determinants and outcomes of family firm ESG performance, synthesize existing knowledge, and suggest future research directions. The findings reveal the nuanced and at times ambiguous role of family involvement across different ESG dimensions. Additionally, methodological challenges have contributed to inconclusive results in certain areas. This literature review identifies several promising new directions for future research at the intersection of family firm and ESG research to enhance our understanding and foster a more integrated and comprehensive approach to studying ESG in family firms. © The Author(s) 2024.","CSR; Determinants and outcomes; ESG; Family firms; Family ownership; G32; Literature review; M14","","R.

However, manufacturing firms lack a full understanding of what effective strategies and mechanisms could deliver eco-innovative solutions optimally. Through the organizational and institutional theories, we develop a conceptual model on the effect of innovation capacity, firms learning capacities, regulatory quality, and rule of law on eco-innovation performance. We adopted the cross-sectional survey design to sample data from 479 respondents of 15 manufacturing firms in Porto-Norvo, Cotonou, and Bohicon cities of Benin. The results indicate that firms’ innovation and learning capacities have a positive impact on eco-innovation. We also found that regulatory quality and rule of law had no positive significant moderating effect on the relationship between firms’ learning capacity and eco-innovation. However, rule of law was negative but significantly moderated the relationship. Our study emphasizes the effect of innovation capacity on firms’ learning capacity and how firms’ learning capacity influences eco-innovation. We also emphasize how rule of law indirectly contribute to eco-innovation performance. This theoretical and empirical analysis has received little attention in the eco-innovation literature. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Eco-innovation; Firms’ learning capacity; Innovation capacity; Institutional environment","","S.

Design/methodology/approach: This analysis is based on a sample of companies listed on the Milan Italian Stock Exchange from the Financial Times Milan Stock Exchange Index over the 2016–2020 period. Regression analysis was used by using data retrieved from the Refinitiv Eikon database and the sample firms’ remuneration reports. Findings: The findings of this paper show that embedding sustainability in executive compensation positively affects firms’ non-financial performance. The results of this paper also reveal that specific corporate governance features can improve the impact of sustainability on non-financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This analysis is limited to Italian firms included in the Financial Times Milan Stock Exchange Index; however, the findings are highly significant. Practical implications: The findings provide regulators with useful insights for considering the integration of sustainability goals into executive remuneration. Another implication is that policymakers should require – at least – listed firms to fulfil specific corporate governance structural requirements. Finally, the findings can provide investors and financial analysts with a greater awareness of the role played by executive remuneration in the long-term value-creation process. Originality/value: This paper contributes to addressing the relationship among sustainability, remuneration and non-financial disclosure, drawing on the stakeholder–agency theoretical framework and focusing on Italian firms.

This is why it is of utmost importance to build a shared and accepted framework to define what we really mean by ESG overcoming the “minimalist” Do Not Significantly Harm (DNSH) principle and moving toward the full achievement of the more ambitious substantial contribution (SC) principle, oriented to the maximization of the social and environmental impact of value creation. To move forward in this direction, our work proposes a relational approach for the assessment of ESG factors focusing in particular on the social pillar. Our conceptual and theoretical proposal argues that, in order to increase the value of that pillar, it is necessary to assess both the internal and external relationships of the firm from an impact perspective, improving at the same time the multidimensional well-being of workers and the capacity to create sustainable development in the local community. The main factors companies should consider to achieve these goals are related to the domains of sense of community, empowerment, good practices of mutual aid and degree of participation at individual, team, organization, and territorial levels that can trigger gift giving, reciprocity and trust, overcoming standard social dilemmas and producing superadditive outcomes together with high social and environmental impact. Starting from these elements, this work proposes a set of indicators and metrics, based on an original methodology to measure and assess the commitment of a firm to increasing social factors. This methodology is particularly suitable for SMEs and start-up companies. © 2022 by the authors.","corporate social responsibility; ESG; gift exchange; multidimensional well-being; social capital; sustainable development","sustainable development","L.

The predictors under consideration are the quality of the corporate governance system (assessed through a comprehensive index), state ownership concentration, industry sector characteristics, and company size. Our cross-sectional sample consists of data for 63 state-controlled enterprises in Romania for the financial year 2018. The data were collected by hand, using two new instruments: a content analysis scale for NFR according to the European Directive 2014/95/EU and a corporate governance index for SOEs. We classify Romanian SOEs into two clusters: ‘high disclosure–good governance’ and ‘low disclosure–poor governance,’ for which we present the particularities of NFR and corporate governance. In line with agency theory and stakeholder theory, we show that the NFR quality score is positively correlated with the corporate governance score, company size, environmental impact, monopolistic position, and the state’s strategic interest, but negatively correlated with state ownership concentration. Our results also indicate that an increase in the state’s blockholding will negatively affect the quality of the corporate governance system, and will ultimately decrease the quality of the company’s non-financial disclosures. We conclude that the quality of the governance system is a mediating variable between the state’s ownership concentration and the quality of NFR. Our results are helpful to professionals and policymakers in understanding the path toward the material harmonization of reporting practices at a European level for SOEs and private entities alike. © 2022 European Accounting Association.","agency theory; Central and Eastern Europe; corporate governance; Non-financial reporting; Romania; stakeholder theory; state-owned enterprises","","M.

The call for sustainability transformations in financial services arose out of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goal agenda. The financial services sector plays an important role in providing sustainable financial services to nudge sustainability practices among firms and consumers around the world. However, efforts for sustainability transformations among financial service providers are still slow, and little research has been documented in this area. So far, no bibliometric analysis has been conducted in this area as well. Therefore, this research undertakes a comprehensive snooping review of extant sustainable financial services research in order to establish a trend of existing financial services sustainability activities to enhance future research possibilities. Our comprehensive review of the Scopus database was guided by the PRISMA protocols, including PRISMA-P and SPAR-4-SLR. Bibliometric and content analysis approaches were also employed as analytical tools within an analytical framework. This study has also employed Microsoft Excel and the VOSviewer tool in conducting performance and science mapping analyses. After article filtering for “sustainability” was conducted, a total of 103 research documents published between 1991 and 2022 were identified as usable samples, which were critically reviewed and analyzed in this study by means of content analysis. Three major themes were investigated, including—sustainable financial products, sustainable financial services delivery, and sustainable financial services marketing strategies. Our findings show a recent growth in academic publications in the area, but also indicate relatively low financial sustainability activities around the world. This research therefore aims to provide present and future innovative insights on sustainable financial services aimed at stimulating more financial institutions, financial service managers, policy makers, and academic researchers to take more action toward greater sustainability development activities in the financial services sector. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Banking institutions; Bibliometrics; Financial services; Non-bank financial institutions; SDG; Sustainability; Sustainable financial services marketing","","O.P.

This study aims to unravel the intellectual structure of the research on SRI. At present, SRI is undertheorized, and the extant literature is divided into multiple fragments. Existing review studies on SRI suffer from limitations related to definitions and methods. We organize the theoretical lines of extant research and tie them up with empirical studies in the field by using systematic literature review and bibliometric techniques on a corpus of as large as 976 research articles. Our study describes the current dynamics of the SRI field, clusters the fragments of research into meaningful themes, highlights the impediments to current research, and also proposes an agenda for future research. Although research on SRI occurs globally, the lack of academic collaboration among scholars and undertheorization are two major challenges of the field.

Despite an extensive body of literature exploring the link between organisational justice (OJ) and innovation, a comprehensive synthesis regarding whether fair treatment within the workplace fosters innovation is notably lacking. This systematic review elucidates a predominantly positive correlation between OJ and various dimensions of innovation, although in some instances suggesting a neutral relationship between the two constructs. Furthermore, the research highlights knowledge sharing as a prominent intermediary variable among scholars. The study contributes significantly by demystifying the nuances of the relationship between OJ and innovation. Second, it introduces a categorisation of OJ and innovation subconstructs and identifies emergent concepts based on cluster analysis. Third, it presents a comprehensive conceptual model linking OJ, innovation, and several variables.

This research investigates CSR assessment and CSR sustainability in the context of strategic CSR-related activities of MFIs, aiming to optimize resource allocation and enhance their CSR initiatives. Data was collected from 875 employees and clients of large MFIs in the Philippines and analyzed using structural equation modeling in AMOS 24. The findings revealed that CSR assessment and CSR sustainability were significantly linked to strategic CSR-related activities, and CSR assessment had a significant link with CSR sustainability. These findings emphasize the importance of strategic orientation in CSR-related activities and support the logical precedence of Carroll's CSR Pyramid and Battal's CSR Train Theories, which advocate for a balanced approach encompassing economic, legal, ethical, environmental, and philanthropic responsibilities. This study contributes to the literature by exploring strategic and sustainable CSR in MFIs in developing countries, where the topic has not been broadly studied. The results can serve as a reliable basis for ensuring transparency, assessment effectiveness, and the creation of an integrative CSR framework for MFIs. © 2024, Sarawak Research Society.

There is no academic review of this field; therefore, this study aims to close this research gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper systematically reviews the existing literature on sustainability materiality research. Papers were qualitatively classified and analysed in accordance with the theoretical underpinning, research methods and academic themes of sustainability materiality research. Findings: The findings of the review show that scholarly work on sustainability materiality has increased exponentially since the 2010s. In terms of research methods, scholars have examined sustainability using content analysis techniques and qualitative approaches. A common theoretical foundation was missing, but an increasing number of articles have been anchored to stakeholder theory. The academic themes have progressively enriched empirical evidence on the evaluation of materiality in sustainability information. Research limitations/implications: This review can be useful as an academic basis to open avenues for strengthening theoretical and empirical research on new emerging issues regarding double materiality and dynamic materiality. Originality/value: This paper conducts the first SLR of academic knowledge on sustainability materiality research. Eight academic themes are proposed to classify sustainability materiality.

Although there have been studies on green innovation of new energy enterprises in recent years, few studies have been conducted from the perspective of ESG, whether informal environmental regulation represented by ESG can stimulate the green innovation of new energy enterprises is of great significance to China’s construction of a low-carbon and secure energy system. In this paper, from the perspective of informal environmental regulation, based on the ESG ratings of SynTao Green Finance’s first public new energy listed companies as an exogenous shock, and taking A-share new energy listed companies as a sample from 2010 to 2021, we empirically verified the effect and mechanism of ESG ratings on the green innovation of new energy companies in terms of the quantity and quality of green innovations by utilizing the Staggered Difference-in-difference (DID) model. The findings demonstrate that new energy enterprises’ green patent numbers and quality are greatly enhanced by ESG grading. However, there is clear heterogeneity in this green innovation effect, which is particularly visible in new energy firms with state-owned enterprise and greater enterprise scales and a higher level of digitization. The Mechanistic findings suggest that ESG ratings drive green innovation by alleviating financial constraints, reducing agency risk, and boosting R&D, thus providing empirical evidence for the development of a green innovation ecosystem in the new energy industry.

It specifically investigates the main determinants which influence the decision behind publishing the CSR report according to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guideline standards. Two different samples were employed for the year 2019: United States (US) listed companies in S&P 500 and European companies listed in STOXX Europe 600. Three main aspects were considered regarding the potential determinants: Board of Directors (BoD) attributes, company commitment to CSR network, such as United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and interactions with CSR management standardization institutions (such as ISO 14000). BoD's attributes comprise of three main dimensions, namely, non-executive directors, Chief Executive Officers' (CEO) duality situations, and board gender diversity (BGD). From an agency-oriented theory, US companies with more non-executive directors in BoD are more likely to publish a CSR report in accordance with GRI guideline standards. In addition, CEO duality situation is a crucial factor behind publishing a GRI report only for the US companies reducing the likelihood of companies to publish a GRI report. Furthermore, the results revealed that BGD (more women) favorably affects the decision for the CSR information dissemination under GRI requirements for both US and European companies. Under the prism of legitimacy theory, the commitment to CSR networks and the interaction with CSR management standardization institutions seems to increase the likelihood to publish GRI so as to obtain the social “license to operate” to continue their business operations. The obtained results are crucial since they provide useful implications to dominant stakeholders, mainly to shareholders and BoD, socially responsible investors (SRI) and to regulators and policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Board gender diversity; Corporate social responsibility; Disclosure information; Global reporting initiatives","Economic and social effects; Publishing; Board gender diversity; Boards of directors; Chief executive officer; Comparatives studies; Corporate social responsibility; Disclosure information; European companies; Gender diversity; Global Reporting Initiative; United Nations; Standardization","G.

It plays a crucial role in alleviating regulatory pressure, enabling green innovations, enhancing performance, and fostering sustainable development. Despite extensive research in the field, comprehensive reviews and bibliometric analyses remain scarce. To address this gap, this study meticulously analyzed 851 papers indexed in the WoS’s SSCI and SCI from 2004 to 2024. Using visualization tools like VOSviewer and CiteSpace, it conducted a multidimensional bibliometric analysis and systematic review, identifying core authors such as Aseem, Ntim, and Zeng, high-productivity countries including China, the USA, and the UK, and key journals like the Journal of Cleaner Production and Sustainability. Keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis revealed central research themes of environmental information disclosure, innovation, and environmental management systems. Burst analysis highlighted emerging hot topics, notably ecological and green innovation, and the interplay between Total Factor Productivity and environmental regulations. Additionally, we identified several critical gaps in the field. For instance, research on corporate environmental governance mechanisms in the context of digital transformation remains insufficient. Furthermore, the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder collaborative governance frameworks requires ongoing investigation. Therefore, we encourage future researchers to focus on the following topics: digitization and environmental compliance, multi-stakeholder participation mechanisms, cost–benefit analysis of corporate environmental compliance, and the impact of political and regulatory environments on corporate environmental compliance. © 2024 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; corporate governance; environmental compliance; environmental performance; environmental regulation; green innovation; multi-stakeholder participation; sustainability","bibliography; compliance; corporate social responsibility; environmental legislation; industrial performance; innovation; literature review; participatory approach; software; sustainability; sustainable development","Z.

Carbon emissions can be found throughout the entire life cycle of access networks, data centers and communication user devices. The focus of this study is the embodied carbon emissions of user devices associated with accessing networks, hence tablets, smartphones and feature phones, laptop and desktop PCs, PC displays and customer premises equipment (CPEs). The purpose is to investigate the embodied carbon emissions by applying different approaches: i) the commonly used approach where estimated product carbon emissions are scaled up by shipments, ii) allocation of the electronic sector companies’ reported data combined with materials data for the products, and iii) the upstream carbon emissions reported by user device vendors (final manufacturers). Despite its sensitivity to allocation the second approach is considered to give the most reasonable overall result of about 180 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) related to chosen user device types and shipments in 2020. Underreporting of scope 3 in the data sources of the vendors, and sensitivity to specific product data sets with very high display values are two major concerns of the other approaches. Representative embodied emissions for user devices are derived for 2020: 50 kg CO2e for a smartphone, 20 kg CO2e for a feature phone, 100 kg CO2e for a tablet, 200 kg CO2e for a laptop, 350 kg CO2e for a desktop PC, 100 kg CO2e for a PC display and 30 kg CO2e for a CPE. © 2023 The Authors","Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Computer; CPE; Desktop; Display; Electricity consumption; Embodied emissions; GHG emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; ICT; ICT industry; ICT sector; Information and communication technologies; Laptop; Monitor; PC; Phone; Tablet","Carbon dioxide; Display devices; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information use; Laptop computers; Life cycle; Ships; Smartphones; Carbon emissions; Customer premises equipment; Desktop; Electricity-consumption; Embodied emissions; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; ICT; ICT industries; ICT sector; Information and Communication Technologies; Laptop; Monitor; Phone; Tablet; Carbon footprint","N.

We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors’ views and boards’ openness to them.

Therefore, in this paper, we systematically reviewed and critically evaluated recent research on this topic. In doing so, we identified important constructs that help us better define and understand the phenomenon of social sustainability in the workplace. We focused on articles from 2016 to 2022 with content related to three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely health and wellbeing (SDG-3), gender equality (SDG-5), and decent work (SDG-8). Given the harrowing events of the past 2 years, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global impact of the war in Ukraine, we also wanted to learn whether other categories, such as security (SDG-11) and peace (SDG-16), are embedded in the concept of social sustainability at work. The articles we studied were found through EBSCOhost, specifically in the Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, APA PsycInfo, SocINDEX with Full Text, and GreenFILE databases. We selected 67 articles and organized them according to the four levels of research and practice in work and organizational psychology. In reviewing the literature, we identified several constructs that can be classified at four levels of interest in work and organizational psychology. At the level focused on the job/work, we identified two main topics: (i) sustainable job/work characteristics and (ii) sustainable job (re)design. At the people-focused level, we identified the following topics: (i) pro-sustainable self-system, (ii) pro-sustainable job attitudes and motivation, (iii) sustainability work environment perceptions and other mediating mechanisms, and (iv) sustainable job behavior. The organization-focused level includes (i) organizations as human systems and (ii) pro-sustainable organizational policies and practices. The last (society-focused) level is defined by two main topics: (i) understanding society as a human system and (ii) pro-social mechanisms. In the discussion, we categorized specific constructs identified within the described focus levels into the theoretical model describing the psychological concept of social sustainability in the workplace from the perspective of sustainable goals.

To address this gap, this review aims to map research on women's involvement in family firms (WIFF), the most common form of business entity worldwide, which appears to provide an enabling environment for women to act as leaders and entrepreneurs. First, through a systematic process, we select 225 papers identified from the Web of Science database and perform a bibliographic coupling analysis that explores the WIFF dataset with the support of clustering algorithms. The results of the review reveal five thematic clusters: (1) female entrepreneurs and family firms; (2) women in family-firm governance; (3) family–business dynamics; (4) women in business succession; and (5) temporal and spatial dimensions of women's involvement. Second, we supplement the bibliometric analysis with a review of the literature, which enhances understanding of the research topics and theoretical perspectives adopted, helping to develop an integrative framework and formulate new research questions that support the development of this promising field of research. Thus, this review provides a robust roadmap for further investigation of key issues in the field, which can help academics, policymakers and practitioners. © 2021 The Authors.

Empirical data were collected from 292 employees working in one of the holding companies, Egypt. The results support the hypothesized model, in which responsible leadership is a significant predictor of employees green behaviors. Moreover, it was found that psychological ownership significantly mediates the relationship between responsible leadership and such behaviors, while green moral identity significantly moderated that relationship. The theoretical and managerial implications of results are discussed. Primarly, organizations should reinforce leaders’ sense of commitment toward protecting the environment. In turn, leaders should instil the concept of environmentalism as a continuous way of life in workplace culture. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Egypt; employees green behaviors; green moral identity; psychological ownership; responsible leadership","","O.A.
