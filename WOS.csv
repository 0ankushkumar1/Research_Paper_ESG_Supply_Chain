To address this gap, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 313 employees from five Chinese supply chain enterprises. Through factor analysis, this study identified four latent variables associated with environmental factors, three with social factors, and four with governance factors. A structural equation model was then developed to present a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of the three ESG dimensions and digital intelligence on SCR, while also examining the interplay among these ESG factors. The findings reveal that environmental factors positively influence SCR, whereas social and governance factors exert a negative impact. This study further observes that digital intelligence enhances ESG factors but does not directly influence SCR. These results underscore the intricate dynamics between ESG indicators, digital intelligence, and SCR, highlighting the imperative for supply chain entities to make balanced decisions. This research offers novel insights into the effects of ESG factors from the employees' viewpoint, providing implications and recommendations for supply chain management.","[Zheng, Lingyu; Chen, Han; Zheng, Wenjia] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University,"Zheng, LY (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",lyzheng@shmtu.edu.cn; 202430610137@stu.shmtu.edu.cn; wjzheng@shmtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,39,0,0,12,12,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2024,16,24,,,,,,,11012,10.3390/su162411012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162411012,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Chamanara, S; Goldstein, BP; Newell, JP",,,,"Chamanara, Sanaz; Goldstein, Benjamin P.; Newell, Joshua P.",,,Power asymmetries in supply chains and implications for environmental governance: a study of the beef industry,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,,,Article,,,,,,Power asymmetry; Supply chain governance; Supply chains; Beef; ESG; Corporate social responsibility; Sustainability; Environmental governance,GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION,"PurposeSupply chain governance constitutes the rules, structures and institutions that guide supply chains toward various objectives, including environmental sustainability. Previous studies have provided insight into the relationship between governance and sustainability but have overlooked two crucial dimensions: power dynamics and the influence of outside actors. This paper aims to address these two gaps by measuring differential power (i.e. power asymmetries) among actors across the supply chain, including external actors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper quantifies power dynamics across the entire chain through a structured survey in which supply chain participants rank their peer's ability to affect environmental and social outcomes. This paper tests this approach by surveying 200 industry professionals (e.g. feedlot owners, retailers) and external actors (e.g. NGOs) in the US beef sector. FindingsRespondents ranked the most powerful actors as follows: feedlot owners; processing plant owners; and regulatory agencies. Results also revealed that trade associations, retailers and cow-calf producers and ranchers perceive a sense of powerlessness. This study reveals multiple power nodes and confirms a shift in the power structure depending on which indicator respondents considered (e.g. environmental impacts vs employee safety). This study concludes that the buyer-producer dichotomy often used to assess supply chain governance fails to capture the complex dynamics among actors within supply chains. Originality/valueThis study demonstrates a novel approach to measure perceptions of power in supply chains. This method enables researchers to map networks of power across entire supply chains, including internal and external actors, to advance understanding of supply chain governance dynamics. Previous studies have misidentified who governs environmental outcomes in supply chains, and NGOs have overestimated the power of consumers and retailers to influence producers.","[Chamanara, Sanaz] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Goldstein, Benjamin P.] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Newell, Joshua P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; McGill University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Chamanara, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",sanazch@umich.edu; ben.goldstein@mcgill.ca; jpnewell@umich.edu,,,,,,,62,5,5,6,58,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,JUL 3,2023,28,5,,,,,923,938,,10.1108/SCM-02-2022-0068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-02-2022-0068,,APR 2023,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, pesticides may cause negative environmental and human health effects depending on their specific distribution and use. Securing environmental safety and sustainability of pesticide distribution and use is widely seen as an important challenge for pesticide governance. This paper analyses how, why and under what circumstances Ethiopian pesticide supply chain actors deal with (un)safe distribution and use of pesticides and assesses their potential contribution to securing the quality, environmental safety and sustainability of pesticides importation, distribution and use. The framework developed for this is based on sustainable supply chain governance in order to assess the roles of and the interactions between the different chain actors, supporters and influencers. On the basis of field research in Ethiopia among key chain actors (importers, retailers, farmers) we analyse their involvement in three different environmental governance mechanisms: governing material flows of pesticides, managing information on health and environmental safety and providing training and capacity-building services. The study found the organisation of the pesticides supply chain in Ethiopia as atomistic. Environment and health hardly played a role in pesticides handling by the different supply chain actors, which was dominated by immediate profit motives. As a consequence smallholder farmers are put at risk because they are refrained from training, support or information provision on pesticides. Indeed, it was a failure of state governance that led importers and retailers to aggressive marketing and distributing pesticides unsafely and hinder the proliferate of private mode of governance. At the same time, a small signs of hope have also been identified at the supporters' and influencers' side of the chain. Successful environmental supply chain governance for safe pesticide distribution and use requires coordination and as well as training and information sharing (interaction) among pesticide supply chain actors, supporters and influencers at all levels-local, national and global as elements of one system of governance. Finally, the evidence presented in this paper suggests that due to limits in governmental capacity and concerns on commercial viability and on social and environmental impacts among private actors, there will be a role for private actors alongside public actors to ensure safe pesticide distribution and use. Public-private partnerships might constitute an attractive strategy for this aim. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Mengistie, Belay T.; Mol, Arthur P.

At the same time, societal pressures surrounding the environmental accountability of firms are growing, with an increasing number of environmental scandals related to supply networks. Traditional governance frameworks of green supply chain management (GSCM) may be insufficient to deal with this new reality, because they do not consider supply network structure/complexity, and how these factors interact with different governance mechanisms. Our study takes into account the complex interplay between GSCM governance mechanisms, supply network structure/complexity, and environmental performance. We introduce a series of theoretical propositions grounded in an extensive review of the GSCM, supply networks, network complexity, and organizational design literatures. In particular, we argue that supply network structure and complexity directly affect GSCM effectiveness, but that these effects will be contingent upon the type of governance mechanism applied (formal or informal).","[Tachizawa, Elcio M.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Wong, Chee Yew] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain Management, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Leeds,"Tachizawa, EM (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",,,,ESRC [ES/J016799/2] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,108,144,153,10,205,,,,1523-2409,1745-493X,,,,JUL,2015,51,3,,,,,18,32,,10.1111/jscm.12072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jscm.12072,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The government sets the tax of the upstream impact and designs the subsidy threshold value to promote the green effort of firms. This paper presents the optimal decision of the supply chain and the effective environmental governance strategy of the government. A Stackelberg game between the government and a two-echelon supply chain is constructed, where a supplier makes core parts for a manufacturer. First, we compared the effects of subsidy on the pricing decisions of firms and identified the profitable condition of the green effort of manufacturers. Results corroborate that a negotiated space for suppliers and manufacturers exists to reduce the environmental impact from the source, especially when the tax legislation is strict. Second, we obtained the optimal upstream contract of environmental impact in supply chains, which appears a phenomenon of the Matthew effect under any type of governance strategies. This finding affirms that subsidies make supply chains inclined to choose a greener upstream decision. The condition when subsidies make sense by effective environment improvement in the supply phase was further derived. Finally, with tax and subsidy governance strategies, the multi-perspective social welfare was simulated and analyzed. Accordingly, we verified that the growth boundary of the supply-chain profit with high subsidy threshold is better than that of the social welfare or the environment performance. It implies that setting the green subsidy standard originally high is a comprehensively sustainable choice for social welfare. In addition, the simulations of three tax structures were analyzed in extensions.","[Li, Yongjian; Deng, Qianzhou; Feng, Lipan] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chi] Tianjin Univ Technol, Sch Management, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tianjin University of Technology,"Li, YJ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",liyongjian@nankai.edu.cn,,,,,,,49,49,49,14,165,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,JUL,2020,290,1-2,,,SI,,439,462,,10.1007/s10479-018-2975-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-018-2975-z,,,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to these sustainability issues, consumers, governments, and non-governmental organizations are pressuring food companies to rethink their current business concepts of food production. Food companies rely on supply chain governance and its mechanisms to implement sustainability standards across all tiers of their supply chains. This study examines the sustainability governance at all stages of a cocoa supply chain, from the raw material production to the retailer, by using a qualitative case study approach. The results show a differentiation of the sustainability governance according to the different supply chain stages. At the raw material production stage, sustainability is mainly improved using contracts, extensive and frequent knowledge sharing, and audits. After the raw material production stage, environmental and social sustainability is almost exclusively coordinated by certificates, while other governance mechanisms are used to foster long-term economic business relationships. This study gives detailed insights into the application intentions and the functioning of sustainability governance mechanisms and provides propositions on how to efficiently improve sustainability in food supply chains.","[Keller, Jakob; Jung, Martin; Lasch, Rainer] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Keller, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",jakob.keller@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,56,3,3,6,42,,,,,2071-1050,,,,SEP,2022,14,17,,,,,,,10763,10.3390/su141710763,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710763,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is based on the assumption that such standards increase legitimacy among stakeholders.

This strategy jeopardizes the reputation of social and environmental standards among stakeholders and their long-term trust in these instruments of CSR, meaning that all expenses for their implementation are of no avail for the companies. Therefore, this paper highlights which criteria are important for the selection, implementation and improvement in order to achieve a company's aim, but also to strengthen the legitimacy of social and environmental standards.

Meanwhile, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), as vital strategies for resource acquisition and sustainable development, are inherently connected to the acquisition of supply chain financing. This paper conducts theoretical exploration and empirical research on the nexus between ESG performance and supply chain financing using Chinese A-share listed companies, analyzing ESG consistency from the temporal and structural dimensions. The findings reveal an inverted U-shaped impact of ESG performance on supply chain financing, with temporal consistency of ESG reinforcing this relationship. However, the impact of ESG structural consistency is not significant, potentially due to the nascent stage of ESG practice in China. The research highlights capital accumulation, resource pooling of ESG, and the substitution effect of supply chain financing as key drivers. Notably, this relationship is pronounced in settings with high supplier concentration and trust. The findings offer valuable insights for enhancing corporate ESG practices and sustainable economic growth.","[Xin, Chunhua; Zhu, Ran] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Management, 11 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Guo, Fengqi] Natl Ctr Climate Change Strategy & Int Cooperat, 5 Houyingfang Hutong, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Zhu, R (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Management, 11 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",410647409@qq.com; zhuran_99@163.com; 2872255709@qq.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [23BJY084],National Social Science Fund of China,"Funding This work is supported by The National Social Science Fund of China (No. 23BJY084) , for which we are grateful.",,81,0,0,34,34,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,MAR,2025,377,,,,,,,,124688,10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124688,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124688,,FEB 2025,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, firms still differ in both the pervasiveness of such collaborative approaches along the value chain and the extent to which sustainability issues are addressed to the advantage of all parties involved. In an attempt to predict variety in the governance models related to sustainability along the value chain, we propose a theoretical model that identifies and frames four sustainable supply chain governance (SSCG) models, resulting from combinations of supply chain network density and centrality of the focal organizations. We show how, as centrality increases, firms are able to exert influence over their network, coordinating integrated approaches along the value chain. Moreover, as high centrality combines with increasing interconnectedness of the actors within a supply chain network, instrumental approaches are progressively replaced by more relational attitudes aimed at joint value creation among partners. Conditions for SSCG models' success and the main benefits gained by firms in different structural contexts are also discussed.","[Vurro, Clodia; Perrini, Francesco] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Russo, Angeloantonio] Parthenope Univ, Dept Inst & Terr Syst Studies, I-80133 Naples, Italy",Bocconi University; Parthenope University Naples,"Vurro, C (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",clodia.vurro@unibocconi.it; angelo.russo@uniparthenope.it; francesco.perrini@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,81,167,180,10,186,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,,2009,90,,,4,SI,,607,621,,10.1007/s10551-010-0595-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-010-0595-x,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the most notable changes in the way companies work with sustainability issues is the shift of the focus from own operations to improving the performance of supply chains. This paper aims to analyse the practise of corporate responsibility in the supply chain through the lens of two distinct but related fields of research: Global Value Chain analysis and Supply Chain Management. Using data from two empirical studies that were designed to study the practise of Swedish buyers in addressing social and environmental issues in their respective supply chains, we demonstrate that both fields offer vital insights about how companies can and do exercise environmental and social responsibility in their respective supply chains. We suggest that one can better integrate these two perspectives on governance in the supply chain by acknowledging that responsibility in the supply chain can both be exercised through choice and through inter-organisational management.

Structural Equation Modeling and cluster analysis were used to analyze the relationships between supplier assessment, collaboration with suppliers, and environmental performance. The results suggest that (1) both mechanisms, supplier assessment and collaboration with suppliers, have a positive and synergistic effect on environmental performance, and (2) assessment acts as an enabler of collaboration.

The selection of behavior strategies by enterprises is not only affected by the behaviors of upstream and downstream enterprises, but is also related to external supervision by the government and society. Based on a social co-governance framework, this paper establishes a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes suppliers of raw materials, producers, and sellers. In light of the number of risk links in the food supply chain, all equilibrium points are classified into four risk situations, namely zero-link risk, single-link risk, double-link risk, or tri-link risk, to determine the conditions for their stability and verified using Matlab numerical simulation. The results show that the co-governance among the market, government, and society (consumers) is operating at a high-level state under the situation of zero-link risks in the food supply chain. It functions at a mid-level state under the situation of single-link risks and at a low-level state under the situations of double-link and tri-link risks. The risk level is only related to the level of social cogovernance. The initial intention of any of the behavior subjects was not found to be a determining factor in terms of risk degree. Therefore, in order to prevent risks from occurring in all supply chain links concurrently, it is necessary to optimize the composition structure of the multi-supervision force of the government, market, society, and other stakeholders to achieve a multiplier effect in food safety risk control. This may provide insights for developing countries exploring the social co-governance of food safety risks.","[Gao, Huanyu; Dai, Xiaoting; Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Inst Food Safety Risk Management, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jingxiang] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Sci, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wuyang] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Wu, LH (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China: Research on social co-governance of food safety risks and cross-border cooperative governance mechanism [20ZD117],National Social Science Fund of China: Research on social co-governance of food safety risks and cross-border cooperative governance mechanism,The first four authors acknowledge funding support by the National Social Science Fund of China: Research on social co-governance of food safety risks and cross-border cooperative governance mechanism (grant number 20&ZD117).,,78,23,23,20,107,,,,0956-7135,1873-7129,,,,OCT,2023,152,,,,,,,,109832,10.1016/j.foodcont.2023.109832,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2023.109832,,MAY 2023,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the novelty of the topic, along with its significance for both academia and industry, we performed a systematic literature review with the goal of synthesizing extant knowledge and providing a structured research agenda to further expand the field. We found a lively stream of research, notably focused on the need for transparency in supply chain management, the pivotal role of policymakers in driving the ESG agenda forward and the impact of ESG in the supply chain performance. In addition to providing a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of the current state of the art, with the aid of bibliometric data, we provide useful recommendations for future research by developing a structured research agenda and a theoretical framework, synthesizing extant knowledge and covering notable research gaps. The work has implications for both theory and practice. Theoretically, the research agenda acts as a starting point for further research in the field, while simultaneously providing scholars with a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of the art.

Green supply chain management is considered a way to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change concerns. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate whether sustainable supply chain practices reduce carbon emissions and whether supplier environmental, social, and governance (ESG) training further enhances this effect, thereby reinforcing the negative association. We collected data for an international sample of manufacturing firms from Thomson Reuters Eikon for the period between 2002 and 2021 and ran a country-year fixed-effects regression. To address endogeneity, we also utilized two-stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. Our findings indicate that sustainable supply chain practices alleviate carbon emissions. Furthermore, we found that supplier ESG training strengthens this relationship, leading to even higher reductions in carbon emissions. Specifically, this training reinforces the negative association between sustainable supply chain practices and carbon emissions, resulting in a more pronounced decrease in carbon emissions. These results are robust to alternative proxies, samples, and endogeneity concerns. Our study highlights the importance of policy development and collaborative interorganizational actions among supply chain partners in developing solutions to climate change issues. As supply chain activities generate high levels of emissions and regulatory press is mounting, our findings may help firms take proactive actions for greener supply chain management and avoid regulatory sanctions. Additionally, we found that institutional strength stimulates firms' clean supply chain practices. Therefore, we advise policymakers to develop and implement necessary policies in less developed countries with weak public environmental regulations.","[Karaman, Abdullah S.] Winthrop Univ, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA; [Ellili, Nejla Ould Daoud] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Business, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Uyar, Ali] CERIIM, Excelia Business Sch, La Rochelle, France",Abu Dhabi University,"Karaman, AS (corresponding author), Winthrop Univ, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA.",abdullahkaraman@gmail.com,,,,,,,109,4,4,63,92,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,DEC,2024,33,8,,,,,8126,8148,,10.1002/bse.3931,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3931,,AUG 2024,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.","[Munir, M.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of technology (such as blockchain, satellite imaging and others) in improving the veracity and timeliness of SEA in supply chains. We develop conceptualizations of veracity and timeliness appropriate to the SEA context. We also link veracity and timeliness to key steps in the auditing process (data collection, recording and sharing, and analysis and interpretation) and explore technology's role in these steps. We then contrast the traditional audit process to a technology-enhanced audit process and develop an organizing framework to generate a research agenda linking technology-enhanced auditing to veracity and timeliness of the audit process, and, in turn, enhancing social and environmental supply chain performance. The novelty and value of our work lie in its exploration of how technology-enhanced auditing relates to (1) issues related to scope/focus, firm motivations for SEA, and governance of the audit function, (2) three conditions under which the benefits of technology-enhanced audits are most likely, (3) the 4 V's of data (volume, variety, velocity/timeliness and veracity); and (4) possible mechanisms by which veracity and timeliness affect social and environmental performance in the supply chain.

Thus, we analyze the impacts of overall ESG, its three main elements, and each sub elements of ESG on the firm efficiency of 29 suppliers, partners, and customers of Japan Airlines over the period of 2013-2022. First, we employ a two-stage hierarchical network data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique that assesses the interrelationships and interdependencies among the supply chain players in contributing toward achieving their respective operating and profitability efficiencies. Second, we run ordinary least squares regression analyses with 5000 bootstrap replications and determine that overall ESG and its three main elements are positively linked with firm efficiencies. The sub elements of ESG have different impacts on firm efficiencies. That is, resource use and environmental innovation under the Environmental element and human rights and product responsibility under the Social element show significantly positive associations with firm efficiencies. All Governance sub elements positively affect firm efficiencies. The outcomes of this study will be valuable for managers at Japan Airlines and other policymakers within its supply chain because it highlights the importance of focusing on the three main and sub elements of ESG and employing the accurate firm efficiency measurement method when interrelationships and interdependencies of decision-making units exist.","[Kweh, Qian Long] Canadian Univ Dubai, Sch Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Ting, Irene Wei Kiong] Univ Malaysia Pahang Al Sultan Abdullah, Fac Ind Management, Gambang, Pahang, Malaysia; [Asif, Jawad] Univ Gujrat, Dept Commerce, Gujrat, Punjab, Pakistan; [Lu, Wen-Min] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",Canadian University Dubai; Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA); University of Gujrat; Chinese Culture University,"Ting, IWK (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang Al Sultan Abdullah, Fac Ind Management, Gambang, Pahang, Malaysia.",ireneting75@gmail.com,,,Canadian University Dubai; Universiti Malaysia Pahang [UUIC231505/RDU232702],Canadian University Dubai; Universiti Malaysia Pahang,"Canadian University Dubai; Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Grant/Award Number: UUIC231505/RDU232702",,79,3,3,26,46,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,NOV,2024,33,7,,,,,7060,7076,,10.1002/bse.3861,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3861,,JUN 2024,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Confucianist society forms social networks in Confucianist society, called guanxi networks, influence economic behaviours and business practices in the workplace. The purpose of this study is to explore how these social networks influence the implementation of sustainable SCM. In doing so, this study aims to critically investigate the constructs of guanxi networks, their impact on flow of supply chain capital and how this leverages the implementation of sustainable SCM. Design/methodology/approach Two systematic literature reviews are conducted to understand the constructs of social networks in Confucianist culture and their impacts on the flow of supply chain capitals. The reviews also analyse evidence related to the economic, social and environmental practices to reveal the current state of the literature and research gaps. Propositions and a framework are developed to support future research in this area. Findings The constructs of ganqing, renqing, xinren and mianzi in guanxi networks have expanded the contexts of social networks in Western literature. Guanxi networks increase the flow of supply chain capital and generate trust between players, thus enhancing capabilities to implement sustainable SCM. Guanxi networks also create the mechanism of network governance with which to increase sustainable SCM implementation under the institutional logics of sustainability. Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework and justification are based on the reviews of current studies in the field. Future empirical study is encouraged to test the propositions, both in Confucianist culture and other countries with culture of social networks. Originality/value Social networks are socially constructed concepts. The constructs of guanxi networks revealed in this study have developed the knowledge of Western-based social network theory. Besides, arguments from a social network perspective provide an alternative answer to explain increased behavioural commitment and companies' investment in sustainable SCM. This study helps practitioners understand the logic of this social norm and to use it to maximise their operation outputs, including sustainable SCM implementation.","[Lu, Haiyan Emma] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Lu, Haiyan Emma] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Ringgold Stand Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Potter, Andrew; Walker, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Rodrigues, Vasco Sanchez] Cardiff Univ, Dept Business, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Plymouth; Cardiff University; Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Lu, HE (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth, Devon, England.;Lu, HE (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Ringgold Stand Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",Haiyan.Lu@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,140,67,69,8,125,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,,2018,23,4,,,,,257,277,,10.1108/SCM-11-2016-0408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-11-2016-0408,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The informal control of customer relational governance (CRG) in terms of trust and cooperation also plays a role but it is not clear how CRG affects companies in gaining environmental and economic performance through GSCM practices. To explore the role of CRG, this paper develops a conceptual model with four hypotheses to propose moderation and mediation effects of CRG on the relationships between two GSCM practices (green innovation and green purchasing) and environmental/economic performance. Based on 333 questionnaires collected from a typical export-oriented city in China, two CRG factors are identified, they are, relationship & trust, and cooperation & reciprocity. Statistic results through hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that both moderation and mediation effects exist. CRG partially mediates the effect of GSCM practices on environmental performance. However, relationship & trust can be detrimental for green innovation to bring environmental performance. If companies aim to improve economic performance through green purchasing, they should establish relationship & trust with customers. Meanwhile, cooperation & reciprocity with customers is needed for companies to gain economic performance through green innovation. This paper contributes to extend the previous studies of formal control from customers to examine the role of CRG for GSCM association of performance improvement. Statistic results identify effective governance mechanisms from the perspective of customer relations to achieve environmental and economic performance through GSCM practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the capacity of supply chain regulation to influence production practices on the ground has been persistently questioned. Through empirical analysis of transnational regulatory interventions in the Indonesian tin sector-centered on a multi-stakeholder Tin Working Group established by prominent global electronics brands-this paper explores the challenges and limits of voluntary supply chain governance as it interacts with an entrenched 'extractive settlement' in Indonesia's major tin producing islands of Bangka and Belitung. Although the Tin Working Group has introduced localized initiatives to tackle issues such as worker safety and improved land rehabilitation, it has also contributed in diffuse and largely unintended ways to consolidating the power of political and economic elites who benefit from centralized control over resource extraction. In this sense, supply chain governance has generated 'hidden costs' through unintended effects on power struggles between competing social groups at national and sub-national levels-generating marginal benefits for ameliorating specific regulatory 'problems', while consolidating and reproducing barriers to deeper transitions towards inclusive or sustainable regimes of extractive governance.","[Diprose, Rachael; Macdonald, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kurniawan, Nanang] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Polit & Govt, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Winanti, Poppy] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",University of Melbourne; Gadjah Mada University; Gadjah Mada University,"Macdonald, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",kmac@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,95,15,15,4,29,,,,0969-2290,1466-4526,,,,MAY 4,2022,29,3,,,SI,,792,817,,10.1080/09692290.2020.1814844,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1814844,,SEP 2020,,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use a major food retailer as a critical case to evaluate the effectiveness of a company led supply chain standard in improving environmental farm management practices. We find that the company led standard increases the adoption of most environmental best management practices among the company's fruit, vegetable and flower growers in South Africa. This result is robust across two identification strategies: a panel analysis of over 950 farm audits and a cross-sectional matching analysis using original survey data. In-depth interviews suggest that the program's unique focus on capacity building through audit visits by highly trained staff, coupled with a close business relationship between the retailer and their growers help to explain the increased effectiveness of the program as compared to other private environmental standards. Contrary to the argument that company-led initiatives are mere window dressing, this study provides a critical example of the positive role private governance mechanisms can play in improving environmental farm management practices globally.","[Thorlakson, Tannis] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hainmueller, Jens] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hainmueller, Jens] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lematre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, Pl Louis Pasteur 3, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Thorlakson, T (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, 473 Via Ortega,Suite 226, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",thorlaks@stanford.edu,,,Stanford Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources' Victoria and David Rogers Fund; George Rudolf Fellowship Fund; Stanford Dean A.

Consequently, some organizations have begun to integrate these dimensions in recent years. Researchers and practitioners are also working to accelerate the transition for more equitable, sustainable, post fossil carbon societies by working with all relevant stakeholders. This Special Volume of Journal of Cleaner Production is focused upon on diverse types of supply chain relationships, governance mechanisms, and innovations, which can foster effective and efficient sustainable supply chain management. This volume is comprised of twenty-seven articles and a book review. Fifteen of the articles address the supply chain relationships domain, while five focus primarily upon governance, five upon innovation, and two on relationships and governance. However, there is a huge potential to further explore the opportunities towards achieving sustainability by implementing proper governance mechanisms and eco-innovation strategies.

A systematic literature review is used to examine the breadth of the sustainable supply chain literature. The papers obtained are screened and analysed using established procedures to produce bibliometric and thematic analyses. The findings show the evolution of this young field around key research groups with few papers looking beyond focal firms to immediate suppliers and even fewer examining multiple tiers. Whilst numerous organisational factors are identified, few works consider most of them together and none capture their interrelationships at such breadth. Within this field lacking in theory, the originality of the work is the assembly of environmental and social practices into an integrated framework for their diffusion across supply chain tiers in the design and implementation of supplier development initiatives. There is recognition of where in the supply chain these practices are applied. The implications of this research are a framework around which supply chain diffusion theory can be tested and subsequent potential for its deployment in business to guide sustainable practice adoption.","[Dias Pimenta, Handson Claudio] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Rio Grande do Norte, Res Nucleus Sustainable Enterprise NESE, Campus Natal Cent IFRN CNAT, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Ball, Peter] Univ York, Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Salonitis, Konstantinos] Cranfield Univ, Dept Mfg Sustainable Mfg Syst Ctr, Cranfield, Beds, England",Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; University of York - UK; Cranfield University,"Pimenta, HCD (corresponding author), Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Rio Grande do Norte, Res Nucleus Sustainable Enterprise NESE, Campus Natal Cent IFRN CNAT, Natal, RN, Brazil.",handson.pimenta@ifrn.edu.br,,,,,,,124,15,16,12,92,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,NOV,2021,28,6,,,,,1870,1890,,10.1002/csr.2165,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2165,,JUL 2021,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper highlights the critical, but underresearched role of traders-companies whose core business lies in the movement and exchange of agricultural commodities between producers and manufacturers-in linking corporate sustainability ambitions to on-the-ground impacts. Drawing on a systematic analysis of the major transnational corporations trading cocoa, coffee, and palm oil, we present advantages and potential pitfalls of relying on traders as implementers of sustainability governance and outline a future research agenda that focuses on producer-level impacts, changes in supply chain organization and power dynamics, and traders' interactions with state and other nonstate actors. At the intersection of supply chain management, political economy, geography, and global governance, research on traders as key sustainability governance actors also provides novel opportunities for interdisciplinary work and stakeholder engagement.","[Grabs, Janina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci D GESS, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Carodenuto, Sophia Louise] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Victoria,"Grabs, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci D GESS, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",janina.grabs@gess.ethz.ch,,,,,,,112,75,76,5,72,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,FEB,2021,30,2,,,,,1314,1332,,10.1002/bse.2686,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2686,,JAN 2021,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, we study the collaboration mechanisms among government's regulation, focal firm's incentive, and supplier's effort level under two governance models: (1) centralized pollution fee model (CPF) in which only focal firm pays for pollution fee to government; (2) decentralized environmental tax (DET) in which focal firm and supplier all pay for environmental tax to improve the environment sustainability. Our results show that, In CPF and DET models, government should set a high tax/fee standards when supplier faces great governance difficulty to encourage supplier to increase the technology investment. In addition, under CPF model, the benefits of supplier and social welfare can reach the optimal levels simultaneously. Additionally, under DET model, the benefit of all supply chain members can achieve the optimal levels simultaneously. Therefore, we find that DET model is better than CPF model in achieving the optimal overall performance of the supply chain, which bears the responsibilities of all related bodies. Moreover, we discuss the sensitivity of several important parameters on decision variables and profit function in the CPF and DET modes. These findings can inform environmental regulation policy and cooperation strategy of sustainable operation management.","[Xu, Fangchao] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiukun; Qian, Qinzhen] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Zhao, XK (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",zhaoxiukun@tjufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72002109, 71802143, 71902132]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [24CGL042]; National Social Science Foundation Youth Program [18YJC630260]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education of China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation Youth Program; Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","We gratefully acknowledge the support of grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72002109; 71802143; 71902132), the National Social Science Foundation Youth Program(24CGL042), the Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education of China (18YJC630260).",,58,0,0,5,5,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,2024 DEC 23,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10479-024-06437-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-024-06437-z,,DEC 2024,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As globalized supply chains cross multiple regulatory borders, the firms involved in these chains come under increasing pressure from consumers, NGOs and governments to accept responsibility for social and environmental matters beyond their immediate organizational boundaries. Governance arrangements for global supply chains are therefore increasingly faced with sustainability requirements of production and consumption. Our primary objectives for this introductory paper are to explore the governance challenges that globalized supply chains and networks face in becoming sustainable and responsible, and thence to identify opportunities for promoting sustainable and responsible governance. In doing so, we draw on 16 articles published in this Special Volume of the Journal of Cleaner Production as well as upon the broader sustainable supply chain governance literature. We argue that the border-crossing nature of global supply chains comes with six major challenges (or gaps) in sustainability governance and that firms and others attempt to address these using a range of tools including eco-labels, codes of conduct, auditing procedures, product information systems, procurement guidelines, and eco-branding. However, these tools are not sufficient, by themselves, to bridge the geographical, informational, communication, compliance, power and legitimacy gaps that challenge sustainable global chains. What else is required? The articles in this Special Volume suggest that coalition and institution building on a broader scale is essential through, for example, the development of inclusive multi-stakeholder coalitions; flexibility to adapt global governance arrangements to local social and ecological contexts of production and consumption; supplementing effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms with education and other programs to build compliance capacity; and integration of reflexive learning to improve governance arrangements over time.

The primary data were collected through 22 semi-structured interviews with managers of IKEA China and their multi-tier suppliers. The findings suggest that in order to cope with environmental complexity in implementing multi-tier sustainable initiatives, focal companies tend to create both internal complexity and collaborative complexity in a variety of governance mechanisms. In addition, environmental overlap and available collaborative complexity increase in this process and can feed back into systems to facilitate further creation of requisite variety. We contribute to the multi-tier SSCM literature through providing an in-depth understanding of nuanced mechanisms of managing different tiers of suppliers to cope with complexities by adopting a social systems theory perspective.

From the perspectives of investor trust and supply chain trust, and incorporating legitimacy theory, we empirically examine the relationship between cybersecurity governance, government digital economy regulation, and corporate market value. The study finds that cybersecurity governance significantly enhances corporate market value, primarily through a reputation-building mechanism that strengthens both investor trust and supply chain trust. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the market reputation effect of cybersecurity governance is more pronounced in firms with non-shortsighted management, stronger protection of trade secrets, higher media attention on ESG, and in high-tech industries. Furthermore, government digital economy regulation can further amplify the positive impact of corporate cybersecurity governance on market value, with the most significant effects observed in areas such as rights protection, data sharing, and security safeguards. The findings of this paper provide important practical insights for firms in emerging economies to address cybersecurity risks, stabilize supply chains, and enhance investor cooperation.","[Tan, Weijie] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Guo, Binhua] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiantao] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Guo, BH (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Zhang, QT (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",g2963104936@126.com; qiantao.zhang@xjtlu.edu.cn,,,Shanghai University of Finance and Economics Graduate Student Innovation Fund [CXJJ-2024-334],Shanghai University of Finance and Economics Graduate Student Innovation Fund,This research was funded by Shanghai University of Finance and Economics Graduate Student Innovation Fund (CXJJ-2024-334) .,,62,0,0,29,29,,,,0927-538X,1879-0585,,,,APR,2025,90,,,,,,,,102646,10.1016/j.pacfin.2024.102646,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pacfin.2024.102646,,DEC 2024,,"Business, Finance",,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We identified 12 different governance mechanisms, the classification of which we suggest be based on their structure and purpose. While some differences were found regarding the specific practices used by individual firms, the overall findings indicate no major differences in terms of sustainability management efforts between the supply chain tiers.

Literature exploring environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores in the energy sector is limited, despite the critical effect of the energy production on sustainability. In light of institutional theory, we select four factors (i.e., energy source used by a firm, firm position in the supply chain (SC), firm geographic location, and firm size) that may influence the strategies and operations of firms in electric power SCs impacting their ESG scores. Five hypotheses on the influence of the four factors on firms' ESG scores are developed and tested by means of multiple linear regressions on secondary data from the Refinitiv Eikon database. The Nomenclature of Economic Activities classification was applied to determine 416 relevant firms along electric power SCs (i.e., from mining to electricity transmission and distribution firms, with electricity production firms as focal firms) for which data was extracted for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Our findings reveal that geographic location and firm size significantly influence ESG scores, while the mix of energy sources influences the environmental performance only and the influence of firm position in the SC remains insignificant. These results are explained within institutional theory perspective. This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting variables that may correlate with the sustainability scores of firms along electric power SCs. Moreover, it assists managers and policymakers in identifying, understanding, and influencing sustainability differences in these SCs.","[Hmouda, A. M.

This research fills this gap by demonstrating the use of grey theory in analysing ESG score for Indian firms. To this end, we study the sustainability performances of 39 firms in the Indian context, listed in the Thomson Reuters ESG scores that are consistently rated for their Environmental, Social, and Governance performances, for a period of 5 years from 2014 to 2018. A grey incidence analysis is used to study the most important indicators or attributes contributing to the sustainability performances of the Indian firms. This is important for the continuous improvement of the firm or its supply chains towards sustainability and to enhance the visibility of supply chains to stakeholders. It is observed from the results of the analysis that the Resource use score, the Environmental innovation score, and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy score emerges as the most important indicators contributing to Environmental, Social, and Governance performances of Indian firms. Whereas, the Shareholders score, the Management score, and the Human rights score appears to be among the least determining indicators, in the Indian context to achieving total Environmental, Social, and Governance performances. The research throws insights into the areas of poor performances of firms to achieving sustainability in Indian context. As we observe that two out of the three identified areas, the Shareholders score and the Management score appears in the Governance performance side of evaluation in ESG, the implications are uncovered in the direction of improving the Governance performance of Indian firms.

The analysis brings together four main approaches to chains and network studies - supply chain management (SCM), global commodity chains (GCC), global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs) - to examine how and the extent to which sustainability and sustainability governance are conceptualised and incorporated into their analytical frameworks. The results point to a shift in this combined literature from conceptualising the formation of global chains and networks as sites of inequality under conditions of globalisation, towards a renewed vision on the potential of chains as a site for social and environmental reform. Overall, however, we conclude that the literature on global chains and networks has not adequately conceptualised distinct modes of sustainability governance. In response, we offer an amended typology for identifying how firm and non-firm actors govern sustainability in chains, of chains and through chains in globalised commodity production and consumption. The paper finishes with an exploration of the research frontiers, challenges and continuing potential of chain and network studies to understand the governance of sustainability and a call for further academic debate on the kinds of integrated governance arrangements necessary for future sustainability reform through hybridised public-private economic practice.

While biomass utilization is considered to have considerable impact on the social well-being of farmers and local communities, a better understanding of its social sustainability is urgently needed. The process for determining social issues, however, is subject to relatively arbitrary decisions, and lacks comprehensive structure. Social issues must be based on those social objectives and indicators that can be empirically measured and analyzed using at the existing level of knowledge and data available. This study, therefore, aims to identify the most important and relevant social and governance issues for the biofuel sector, and also to determine the issues for which reliable data and practical methods may become available and ultimately simplified for understanding by stakeholders. The sugarcane biojet fuel supply chain in Brazil was used as a case study with a research design of two steps: literature review and expert survey. From the literature review, 13 social issues and 5 governance issues were selected for inclusion in the expert survey. The survey results showed that highly relevant issues were generally perceived as highly important. Furthermore, very practical issues were also perceived as very reliable and simple issues. It was concluded that future research should mostly focus on quantitative assessment of human health and safety, labor rights, working conditions, which were perceived very important but less reliable, practical, and simple. Moreover, this study showed that all governance issues are certainly regarded as important for sustainability, but insufficiently recognized in conventional sustainability assessment schemes. The current certification schemes cover only a limited number of social issues and require addressing social issues more broadly. Learning from this study helps decision makers to extend understandings of the social dimension of sustainability.","[Kamali, Farahnaz Pashaei; Osseweijer, Patricia; Posada, John A.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands; [Rossi Borges, Joao Augusto] UFGD, Fac Adm Ciencias Contabeis & Econ, Dourados, Brazil",Delft University of Technology; Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados,"Kamali, FP (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands.",f.pashaeikamali@tudelft.nl; joaoborges@ufgd.edu.br; P.Osseweijer@tudelft.nl; J.A.PosadaDuque@tudelft.nl,,,Dutch Ministry of Economic,Dutch Ministry of Economic,"This research is carried out within the BE-Basic R&D Program, which was granted a FES subsidy from the Dutch Ministry of Economic.

Governance plays an important role as a strategy for the revival of such destinations to achieve a more productive, environmental, social and sustainable management structure. Good' governance of a destination depends on all the actors involved in the tourism network. Such governance requires a redefinition of relations between government and society and minimal boundaries between public and private sectors. This paper has analysed the level of implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in a tourist destination that is a biosphere reserve (BR), the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), from a comprehensive approach involving a tourism supply chain (TSC) with private and public agents. The focal firms analysed within the TSC have been tourist accommodation establishments in Fuerteventura. The paper shows that the level of involvement of tourist accommodation in CSR is positive. However, this involvement is not sufficiently high to meet the requirements of a destination designated as a BR. Therefore, coordination policies should be developed that promote governance systems and further enhance sustainability in the destination.","[Angeles Sanfiel-Fumero, M.; Armas-Cruz, Yaiza] Univ La Laguna, Dept Business Management & Econ Hist, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Gonzalez-Morales, Olga] Univ La Laguna, Dept Appl Econ & Quantitat Methods, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna,"Sanfiel-Fumero, MA (corresponding author), Univ La Laguna, Dept Business Management & Econ Hist, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",msanfiel@ull.edu.es,,,Research Project Diseno de escenarios optimos de gobernanza turisticaien Reservas de la Biosfera (GOBTUR) [CSO2012-38729-C02-01]; Directorate General of Research and Management of National R+D+i (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness -Spain National Goverment),Research Project Diseno de escenarios optimos de gobernanza turisticaien Reservas de la Biosfera (GOBTUR); Directorate General of Research and Management of National R+D+i (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness -Spain National Goverment),"This article is the result of the Research Project Diseno de escenarios optimos de gobernanza turisticaien Reservas de la Biosfera (GOBTUR) (CSO2012-38729-C02-01).

Owing to market liberalization and globalization, one of the most challenging issues along agri-food chains in China is becoming the issue of how to link these small-scale farmers into the modern chains. Consequently, it is essential for both policy makers and private sectors to understand the governance structure in agri-food supply chains. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for supply chain governance, including its antecedents and consequences, as well as a series of hypotheses for empirical testing. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework of chain governance is proposed in this study, where governance structure consists of two dimensions: contractual governance and relational governance. The study intends to propose a complementary relationship between contracts and relational aspects, such as trust, in the Chinese context. Future research is needed to empirically test this model. Findings - The proposed conceptual model is unique, since the majority of the articles addressing this topic focuses on contract farming while limited research touches upon the issues of trust and relations. However, a combination of both contracting and relationships are seldom addressed. Originality/value - This paper evaluates a novel concept of two dimensional governance structure in the agri-food supply chain, where transaction cost economics theory and relational theory are combined to study the governance relationships between small scale producers in China and their buyers.","[Zhang, Xiaoyong; Aramyan, Lusine H.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Zhang, XY (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, LEI, The Hague, Netherlands.",Xiaoyong.Zhang@wur.nl,,,EU [44255],EU(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to thank the EU 6th research framework project Chinese Agricultural Transition: Trade, Social and Environmental Impacts (Contract No. 44255) for financial support.",,91,56,63,2,109,,,,1756-137X,1756-1388,,,,,2009,1,2,,,,,136,154,,10.1108/17561370910927408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/17561370910927408,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,,Agriculture; Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contributing to the private governance literature and, in particular, addressing the gap in this research with respect to the political implications of individual firm 'buyer power', the article provides evidence and analysis of how big brand sustainability is altering the power relations within global supply chains, and the governance prospects and limits of this trend. The authors argue that recent brand company efforts through their global supply chains, while still a long way off from their goals, are achieving environmental gains in product design and production. Yet, these advances are also fundamentally limited. Total environmental impacts of consumption are increasing as brand companies leverage corporate sustainability for competitive advantage, business growth, and increased sales. Big brand sustainability, while important, will not on its own resolve the problems of global environmental change. In conclusion, the article highlights the importance of a co-regulatory governance approach that includes stronger state regulations, sustained advocacy, more responsible individual consumerism, and tougher international legal constraints to go beyond the business gains from big brand sustainability to achieve more transformational, 'absolute' global environmental progress.

However, the environmental and social problems caused by express delivery packaging (EDP) have not been well understood yet. It has become an important issue to coordinate the economic, environmental, and social development goals of the government for the sustainable development of the EDP. This paper adopted the system dynamics (SD) method to simulate three subsystems in the express delivery packaging supply chain (EDPSC), i.e., the manufacturer subsystem, the consumer subsystem, and the recycler subsystem. Particularly, the impact of government subsidies on the EDPSC from three dimensions of economy, environment, and society was discussed in this paper. The results showed that (1) CO2 emissions in the end-of-life stage of EDPSC account for about 83.9-91.8%, and incineration as the main carbon emission source of end-of-life reduce by 10-19% compared with no government subsidy. (2) The profit of recyclers is most affected by government subsidies, and incineration power generation is one of the main economic sources for recyclers. As the recycling rate of EDP increased from 2 to 32%, the income from incineration power generation decreased from about 25-40% to 15-25% of the total income. (3) The implementation of government subsidies is beneficial to improve social welfare, which has the biggest impact on consumers' surplus. (4) The comprehensive scenario subsidy is better than the single scenario subsidy, but it will bring a serious cost burden to the government. In the single scenario, the target of government subsidy depends on the level of government subsidy, which is subsidized to consumers at low and medium levels and recyclers at high levels. Therefore, our results can be used to help governments make decisions and also serve as a methodological reference for supply chains in other industries.","[Jiang, Tingting; Sun, Yahong] Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200235, Peoples R China; [Jin, Qiang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Jin, Qiang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Solid Waste Treatment & Res, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Shanghai Institute of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Jin, Q (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Jin, Q (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Solid Waste Treatment & Res, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",jinqiang@sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,66,2,2,3,59,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,MAR,2023,30,11,,,,,29681,29698,,10.1007/s11356-022-24242-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-24242-8,,NOV 2022,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Meanwhile, suppliers' behavior and green operations may influence manufacturers' social image and operations. Thus, governance mechanisms for suppliers may impact the performance of EPR practices. Therefore, from the perspective of supply chain governance, this paper first studies the relationship of manufacturers' EPR practices and operation performance and then introduces three types of supplier governance mechanisms (contract governance, relationship governance and equity governance) to explore the influences on manufacturers' performance. Survey data collected from enterprises in the electronics industry in China show the relationship between manufacturers' EPR practices and performance, as well as the effect of the three proposed governance mechanisms on the performance of EPR practices. The conclusions obtained in this study suggest that manufacturers' EPR practices can significantly improve their environmental and market performances. At the same time, manufacturers can adjust their operation performance according to the choice of supplier governance mechanism, which is chosen based on the operation objectives of the enterprises. To be specific, if the enterprises want to obtain better environmental performance and improve their social image, they should choose a contract governance mechanism that explicitly stipulates the responsibility and obligation of the supplier. In addition, the three proposed governance mechanisms can improve the market performance of enterprises in EPR practices.","[Lu, Xin; Xu, Fangchao] Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,"Xu, FC (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",luxin_87@mail.nankai.edu.cn; xufc@mail.nankai.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71172072, 71672092]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant numbers 71172072, 71672092.",,47,7,7,6,59,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4374,10.3390/su10124374,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124374,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most scholarship takes supply chain solutions at face value, investigating the circumstances under which they are effective, lacking, and how effectiveness could be incrementally improved. These studies have helpfully investigated operational and procedural issues associated with private governance and relationships between stakeholders in standard-setting processes. But the literature often loses sight of broader and more fundamental questions about whether or not private governance initiatives are actually working to solve the problems they've been established to address, like pollution, modern slavery, and global North and South inequalities. In this introduction to the Review of International Political Economy special issue on the hidden costs of global supply chains, we analyse key trends in the effectiveness of private governance solutions, drawing on our literature review of 290 academic journal articles and contributions within this collection. We argue that not only are global supply chain solutions falling short when it comes to many of the indicators that matter most, but they come with hidden costs - including unintended consequences, perverse effects, and unacknowledged impacts.","[LeBaron, Genevieve] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Lister, Jane] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Sheffield; University of British Columbia,"Lister, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",jane.lister@ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2018-1002],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(CGIARSocial Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful to Ed Pemberton for his excellent research assistance and to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), grant #895-2018-1002 for research funding.

Exposing the political economy of environmental costs,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,,Article,,,,,,Artificial intelligence; global supply chains; corporate social responsibility; sustainability; corporate governance; technology,ECOLOGICAL MODERNIZATION THEORY; EARTH; SUSTAINABILITY; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES; CURVE; FOOD,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of global supply chains over the next decade. Transnational corporations are hailing these gains as a 'game changer' for advancing environmental sustainability. Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth. At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors. These findings extend the theoretical understanding in the field of international political economy of the hidden dangers of relying on technology and corporate governance to resolve the deep unsustainability of the contemporary world order.","[Dauvergne, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Dauvergne, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",peter.dauvergne@ubc.ca,,,,,,,162,81,82,30,176,,,,0969-2290,1466-4526,,,,MAY 4,2022,29,3,,,SI,,696,718,,10.1080/09692290.2020.1814381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1814381,,SEP 2020,,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has led to a considerable increase in interest among the researchers and academicians working in the domain of social sustainability. This article reviews 129 research papers published in different journals and attempted to identify drivers, issues, barriers, tensions, practices, and performances related to social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains. The prevalent theories and governance mechanisms of social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains have also been presented. The commonly used theories are stakeholder theory, institutional theory, resource based view theory, transaction cost economics theory, grounded theory, and resource dependence theory. It is observed that most of the papers have presented drivers, barriers, issues, and practices in generic ways by conducting exploratory case studies using single case or multiple cases; there is a distinct lack of multi-tier perspectives devoted to the context of emerging economies. The tension, an important aspect of implementation of social sustainability practices, has not been addressed adequately in the extant literature for multi-tier supply chains. This review also proposes a conceptual framework of social sustainability linking drivers, issues, barriers, tensions, practices, and performances. Finally, future avenues of research on social sustainability have been outlined. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Utilizing the supply chain innovation and application pilot policy as a quasi-natural experiment, we assess the causal impact of supply chain digitization on corporate environmental practices. Our findings reveal that supply chain digital innovation substantially enhances corporate environmental practices. We discuss four underlying economic mechanisms behind this causality: efficiency, governance, resource allocation, and innovation improvements. Furthermore, the impact is more pronounced for industries with high transportation costs, as well as for non-high-tech sectors and non-state-owned enterprises. When companies face weaker environmental regulations, this effect is further amplified. Moreover, we examine the spillover effects of supply chain digital innovation on the environmental practices of upstream and downstream enterprises. The results suggest that supply chain digital innovation could trigger desirable economic consequences by exerting positive impacts on sales volume and market value. These findings offer practical implications for policymakers to leverage smart and digital supply chain systems in attaining SDGs.","[Liu, Ying; Mbanyele, William] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Huang, Hongyun] Shandong Univ, Qingdao Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Huang, Hongyun] Shandong Univ, Ctr Yellow River Ecosyst Prod, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Huang, Hongyun] Shandong Univ, Humanities Lab Theory & Mech Res Value Realizat Ye, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Ctr Social Sci, Vilnius, Lithuania",Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University; Nanjing University of Finance & Economics,"Balezentis, T (corresponding author), Lithuanian Ctr Social Sci, Vilnius, Lithuania.;Huang, HY (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Inst Humanities & Social Sci, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.",hongyunhuang@sdu.edu.cn; wmbanyele@sdu.edu.cn; tomas.balezentis@ekvi.lt,,,Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF [GZB20240409]; Shandong Natural Science Foundation [ZR2024QG169]; Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of Qingdao [QDBSH20240202039],Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF; Shandong Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of Qingdao,The Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF (Grant No. GZB20240409) ; The Shandong Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. ZR2024QG169) ; The Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of Qingdao (Grant No. QDBSH20240202039) .,,117,1,1,29,29,,,,0140-9883,1873-6181,,,,FEB,2025,142,,,,,,,,108161,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.108161,,JAN 2025,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study addresses these gaps by investigating the correlation between national governance capacity (considering voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and corruption control) and agricultural supply chain carbon efficiency and investigating the influence mechanism and mediating role of technological innovation. The relevant findings are twofold. 1) The impact of national governance capacity and its components on agricultural carbon efficiency follows an inverted U-shaped curve. 2) Technological innovation can act as a mediator between national governance capacity and select factors of voice and accountability, government effectiveness and regulatory quality to enhance agricultural supply chain carbon efficiency. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and managers in agricultural supply chain enterprises seeking to transition towards low-carbon agriculture.","[Shang, Hua; Jiang, Li; Pan, Xiongfeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Mangla, Sachin Kumar] O P Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Global Business Sch, Sonipat, Haryana, India; [Song, Malin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ Bengbu, Anhui Prov Key Lab Philosophy & Social Sci Low Car, Bengbu 233030, Anhui, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; O.P.

In this regard, the governance of the global soybean supply chain has become one of the central themes in both industry and academia. However, existing scholarly works focusing on sustainability issues and mechanisms for better governance in the soybean chain are rare. Moreover, the relationship among soybean supply chain governance mechanisms remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature to identify key themes or topics and to develop a conceptual framework to guide future research. Based on our inclusion criteria and by considering the Scopus database, we identified and reviewed 55 articles published between 2000 and 2019. In our analysis, four themes were identified in soybean supply chain management: drivers (e.g., land-use conflict), global value chain governance (e.g., REDD+), consequences (e.g., reduced CO2 emissions) and potential barriers (e.g., low market demand). Finally, a conceptual model was proposed that elaborates the linkage of the themes, and a research agenda was proposed to direct studies in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a research carried out during the SMARTCHAIN project (Horizon project within the research line Innovative agro-food chains: unlocking the potential for competitiveness and sustainability). The research aims at identifying an assessment model for grasping the level of social innovation in Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) taking into consideration the social and sustainability indicators. A specific tool, the Social Innovation Assessment Template (SIAT) was created for this purpose. The SIAT investigates five dimensions of SFSC: economic, environmental, socio-cultural, governance and influence (positive impact on other sectors & stakeholders) dimensions. The assessment has been tested in 9 European countries and 16th case studies.

Assessment initiatives have begun to develop as a proxy measure of social sustainable supply chain management. This research aims to examine how social sustainability assessment initiatives instigate and use institutional pressures to drive third-party accreditation as the legitimate means of demonstrating social sustainability in a global supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Ten assessment initiatives focused on assuring social sustainability across supply chains are examined. Data are collected through interviews with senior managers and publicly available secondary material. Findings - The findings show how the social sustainability assessment initiatives act by instigating institutional pressures indirectly rather than directly. Coercive pressures are the most prevalent and are exerted through consumer and compliance requirements. The notion of pressures operating as a chain is proposed, and the recognition that actors within and outside of a supply chain are crucial to the institutionalization of social sustainability is discussed. Originality/value - Studies on sustainable supply chain management often focus on how companies sense and act upon institutional pressures. To add to the extant body of knowledge, this study focuses on the sources of the pressures and demonstrates how assessment initiatives use coercive, normative and mimetic pressures to drive the adoption of social sustainability assessment in supply chains.","[Kauppi, Katri] Aalto Univ, Dept Informat & Serv Econ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland; [Hannibal, Claire] Univ Wolverhampton, Business Sch, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",Aalto University; University of Wolverhampton,"Hannibal, C (corresponding author), Univ Wolverhampton, Business Sch, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England.",C.Hannibal@wlv.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,57,60,6,117,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,,2017,22,5,,,,,458,472,,10.1108/SCM-01-2017-0004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-01-2017-0004,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Of specific focus are assessments of the extraction and production of minerals and metals needed for a low-carbon energy future. Current trends and projections suggest that the future low-carbon energy system will have greater material needs than the current one. Thus, it is important to better understand the full impacts of increased resource extraction to help ensure a sustainable and just transition. This review reveals that existing methodologies are currently insufficient in capturing the full suite of environmental, social, and governance concerns. The copper supply chain is used as a case study to highlight areas that require refined or augmented methodologies, with an in-depth examination of the corporate practices of Freeport-McMoRan, Vale, and BHP. Together, this review of existing methodologies and examples from the copper supply chain highlight the incomplete and variable nature of environmental and climate reporting within the mining industry.

This approach focuses on the vertical governance dynamics of environmental upgrading along with GVCs. In our contribution, we emphasize the role of horizontal governance as a driver that underpins environmental upgrading processes. These horizontal elements include institutional support, pressure from civil society groups and political dynamics at the local level - which have been relatively overlooked in this literature so far. We examine environmental upgrading in Italian wine value chains, focusing on the fast-growing but environmentally-contested Prosecco and Valpolicella districts. Our analysis suggests that firms within the same industry may follow different processes of environmental upgrading - through certification, going 'back to tradition', technological innovation and/or as an articulation of local politics - also depending on their size. We conclude that horizontal governance is playing a more important role than previously thought in shaping environmental upgrading and provide some suggestions for future research in this realm.","[Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ponte, Stefano] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; [De Marchi, Valentina; Bettiol, Marco; di Maria, Eleonora] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy",Copenhagen Business School; University of Johannesburg; University of Padua,"De Marchi, V (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Padua, Italy.",valentina.demarchi@unipd.it,,,SSHRC (Canada); [895-2018-1002],SSHRC (Canada)(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC));,"he authors thank Gianluca Perillo for invaluable research assistance.

On the other hand, well-calibrated ESG measures should play a central role in guiding a firms' day-to-day supply chain management practices. To illustrate the value of unifying ESG and end-to-end supply chain thinking, we present three supply chain cases that arose amid the COVID-19 pandemic, involving online platforms; public health supply chains; and vaccine development, manufacturing, and distribution, respectively.

While theories on policy integration have primarily focused on the national scale, limited attention has been given to the merging of environmental and human rights considerations in global supply chain sustainability governance. Drawing on policy integration theories, we develop an analytical framework for studying Human Rights and Environmental Integration (HREI) within global supply chain governance, specifically examining the deforestation -land tenure nexus in soy supply chains from Brazil to Europe. Our empirical analysis focuses on key policy instruments, including the Soy Moratorium, the Working Group on the Cerrado, the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS), and the EU Regulation on deforestation -free products (EUDR). Drawing from extensive fieldwork in Brazil, we assess the integration of land tenure in these policy instruments, revealing a general weakness in this aspect. Nonetheless, grassroots organizations have played a crucial role in advocating for enhanced HREI, urging the inclusion of land tenure rights in instruments addressing deforestation. Our research highlights that, although global supply chain instruments may not entirely compensate for the deficiencies of domestic policies, they should, at the very least, strive to comprehensively address complex sustainability problems and prevent actions that could worsen existing issues or give rise to new sustainability problems. In conclusion, our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the opportunities and structural constraints associated with integrated approaches to interconnected human rights and environmental issues.","[Schilling-Vacaflor, Almut] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Int Business Soc & Sustainabil, Sch Business Econ & Soc, D-790402 Nurnberg, Germany; [Gustafsson, Maria -Therese] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Univ vagen 10F, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Stockholm University,"Schilling-Vacaflor, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Int Business Soc & Sustainabil, Sch Business Econ & Soc, D-790402 Nurnberg, Germany.",almut.schilling-vacaflor@fau.de,,,"Research Council for Sustainable Development, Sweden (FORMAS) [2019-01386]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research; [5]; Formas [2019-01386] Funding Source: Formas","Research Council for Sustainable Development, Sweden (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); ; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This work was supported by the Research Council for Sustainable Development, Sweden (FORMAS, Dnr 2019-01386) and Mistra Geopolitics-Navigating Towards a Secure and Sustainable Future, funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research under grant 2016/11 #5.

Heterogeneity experiments reveal that CSR has a greater effect on SCE in nonstate-owned businesses, companies with highly competitive positions, strong media attention, and regions with lower market segmentation. These findings offer practical insights for businesses aiming to integrate CSR into supply chain strategies, providing a new perspective on the economic effects of CSR under varying market and competitive conditions.","[Zhang, Kai] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Audencia Financial Technol Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kai] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yijie] Shenzhen Univ, China Ctr Special Econ Zone Res, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weikun] Lingnan Normal Univ, Sch Social & Publ Adm, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dongyuan] Guilin Univ Technol, Business Sch, Guilin, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Audencia; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Shenzhen University; LingNan Normal University; Guilin University of Technology,"Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, China Ctr Special Econ Zone Res, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",2250401005@email.szu.edu.cn,,,Shenzhen Humanities & Social Sciences Key Research Bases; Research on the Mechanisms and Policy Design of the 'Real Economy Transformation' of Manufacturing Enterprises under the Big Data Strategy: A Quasi-Natural Experiment Based on the Guangdong Big Data Pilot Zone [GD24YGL08]; Youth Project of the Guangdong Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Planning,Shenzhen Humanities & Social Sciences Key Research Bases; Research on the Mechanisms and Policy Design of the 'Real Economy Transformation' of Manufacturing Enterprises under the Big Data Strategy: A Quasi-Natural Experiment Based on the Guangdong Big Data Pilot Zone; Youth Project of the Guangdong Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Planning,"This work is supported by Shenzhen Humanities & Social Sciences Key Research Bases; Research on the Mechanisms and Policy Design of the 'Real Economy Transformation' of Manufacturing Enterprises under the Big Data Strategy: A Quasi-Natural Experiment Based on the Guangdong Big Data Pilot Zone (GD24YGL08), a Youth Project of the Guangdong Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Planning.",,54,0,0,14,14,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,2025 JAN 22,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/csr.3129,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.3129,,JAN 2025,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Further, literature is also void on the study of the interaction effect of SCS and governance in affecting SC performance through reducing risk. This research addresses these two significant research gaps. Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV) and taking mixed methods research design approach this study develops and validates an instrument for measuring supply chain sustainability (SCS) in the context of apparel industry of a developing country. It then investigates the conditional direct and indirect effect of supply chain sustainability on performance through reducing sustainability risks at different levels of sustainability governance. Our findings suggest that SCS is a multidimensional construct consisting of four dimensions: social, environmental, economic (financial) and economic (production). The measurement instrument of SCS also satisfactorily correlates to the technical and evolutionary criteria of DCV. The findings also affirms that the conditional in-direct effect of SCS on market performance via reducing sustainability risk is significant at higher levels of sustainability governance. This study contributes significantly to the body of knowledge by developing and validating a multidimensional scale of supply chain sustainability (SCS) and investigating its impact on market performance through a mediated-moderated modelling approach. In practice, the supply chain managers will be able to adopt appropriate SCS practices and governance mechanism to reduce sustainability risks and improve market performance.

This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approachBased on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP - namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) - the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF's effects on CSP. FindingsThe authors find that SCF has a doing well by doing good effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP's positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF's promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implicationsThis study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF's effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF's role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain - namely, core firm-suppliers and core firm-customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implicationsFirst, our findings indicate that SCF has a doing well by doing good effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to do good. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing. Originality/valueThis study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm's competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy.","[Wang, Shuang; Yu, Hui; Wei, Miaomiao] Chongqing Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",499701903@qq.com; 20180201023@cqu.edu.cn; 1014051064@qq.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72172019, 71872021]",Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Our study was supported by the program of Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Research on Supply Chain Decision Optimization and Cooperative Management Based on Behavior Analysis of Intelligent Decision Making Robot (ID: 72172019), and Research on Robust Intelligent Management of Enterprise Exchange Rate Risk from the Perspective of Supply Chain Cooperation (ID: 71872021).",,97,18,18,20,132,,,,0885-8624,2052-1189,,,,NOV 20,2023,38,11,,,,,2294,2309,,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,,JAN 2023,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While outcomes from M&As may produce mixed results, merger synergies fundamentally change the environmental, social and governance (ESG) footprint of an organisation and its product-supply chain. These compounding challenges of innovation for sustainability and ESG product-supply chain due diligence are not adequately explored in the operations management literature or practically considered during M&As. In this article, we consider those factors that determine how innovative is the deal? and explore how environmental supply chain innovation for sustainability might inform M&As. A case study approach is adopted, drawing upon an exemplar deal within the global food product-supply chain for ingredient production, where high M&A deal-interest and ESG sustainability considerations exist. The theoretical lens is the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. A deal analysis framework, integrating key concepts from strategic environmental supply chain management and the M&A process literature, is defined. These findings suggest that product design and technology selection factors represent sources of M&A value creation when exploring an innovation for sustainability deal thesis. The implication for firms with ambitious environmental agendas or motives is that the M&A process needs to be reconfigured, such that product design and technology selection, currently secondary factors, are considered primary drivers. Together, these drivers form substantive strategic considerations and new merger motives of both theoretical and practical relevance, informing a new perspective of operations sustainability targeted M&A.","[Manocha, Pavan; Srai, Jagjit Singh] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England",University of Cambridge,"Manocha, P (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.",pm532@cam.ac.uk; jss46@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,12,13,10,105,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,10105,10.3390/su122310105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122310105,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Grounded on the transaction cost economics (TCE) and institutional theory (IT), the purpose of this paper is to test whether the adoption of multiple supply chains (MSCs), which adopt both traditional and shortened supply chains, can be used to manage uncertainty and mitigate the risk associated with a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach In order to test the hypothesis, matched questionnaire surveys were developed to collect the data from farm managers and consumers. Completed questionnaires were received from 112 respondents. The hierarchical regression analysis was performed to test hypotheses. Findings The result shows the positive effects of environmental and behavioral uncertainties on MSC adoption and represents the diminished moderating effects of institutions (industrial and consumption tendency) on the relationship between uncertainties and MSA adoption. Research limitations/implications - This study only explored producers and their recommended consumers; future studies can undertake questionnaire designs (one producer-to-many consumers) and empirical analyses with analytic hierarchy process theory to reexamine the hypotheses proposed in this study. Practical implications - MSC adoption is a way to manage uncertainties resulting from spatial and psychological distance in the supply chain. Producers and consumers show their risk preferences by SC adoption after considering pre-constructed societal norms. Therefore, the consumers' and producers' choice of a supply chain reflects a process of communicating risk. The adoption of a mixed governance mode (MSC adoption) and accessing information about common practices are two ways to decrease such uncertainties. Social implications There are multiple goals (traceability, fairness, efficiency, well-being) in the food supply chain that may be satisfied by MSC adoption. Therefore, policymakers should understand the different values of various supply chains and facilitate the development of various supply chain modes. Originality/value This study integrated the undersocialized and oversocialized perspectives (TCE and IT) to understand how uncertainties of supply chains may be diminished. Based on these perspectives, it found that the adoption of the mixed governance mode and accessing of institutional information are two ways to decrease such uncertainties.","[Liu, Chia-Yi] Tunghai Univ, Dept Food Sci, Management Div, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Yu] Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Management & Informat, Tainan, Taiwan",Tunghai University; Southern Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Lee, CY (corresponding author), Southern Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Management & Informat, Tainan, Taiwan.",cylee@stust.edu.tw,,,,,,,92,9,9,4,67,,,,0960-0035,1758-664X,,,,APR 16,2019,49,3,,,,,305,326,,10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2017-0312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2017-0312,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus on the spatial dimension of governance fit in relation to global commodity flows and telecoupled systems. Specifically, we draw on examples from land use and global agricultural commodity governance to examine two overarching types of governance mismatches: boundary mismatches and resolution mismatches. We argue that one way to address mismatches is through governance rescaling and illustrate this approach with reference to examples of three broad types of governance approaches: trade agreements, due diligence laws, and landscape approaches to supply chain governance. No single governance approach is likely to address all mismatches, highlighting the need to align multiple governance approaches to govern telecoupled systems effectively.","[Coenen, Johanna; Newig, Jens; Challies, Edward] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Sustainabil Governance, Luneburg, Germany; [Sonderegger, Gabi; Zaehringer, Julie G.] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm CDE, Bern, Switzerland; [Sonderegger, Gabi; Zaehringer, Julie G.] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Meyfroidt, Patrick; Bager, Simon L.] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Fonds Rech Sci FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium; [Challies, Edward] Univ Canterbury, Sch Earth & Environm, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Busck-Lumholt, Louise M.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain; [Corbera, Esteve] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Corbera, Esteve] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra, Spain; [Friis, Cecilie] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pedersen, Anna Frohn; Qin, Siyu] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Pedersen, Anna Frohn] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany; [Pedersen, Anna Frohn] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anthropol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Laroche, Perrine C.

LCA has recently started to gain popularity among large corporations and initiatives, such as The Sustainability Consortium or the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Both have made the technique a cornerstone of their applied-research program. The Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) is an overarching, global database that eases the data collection burden in S-LCA studies. Proposed hotspots are production activities or unit processes (also defined as country-specific sectors) in the supply chain that may be at risk for social issues to be present. The SHDB enables efficient application of S-LCA by allowing users to prioritize production activities for which site-specific data collection is most desirable. Data for three criteria are used to inform prioritization: (1) labor intensity in worker hours per unit process and (2) risk for, or opportunity to affect, relevant social themes or sub-categories related to Human Rights, Labor Rights and Decent Work, Governance and Access to Community Services (3) gravity of a social issue. The Worker Hours Model was developed using a global input/output economic model and wage rate data. Nearly 200 reputable sources of statistical data have been used to develop 20 Social Theme Tables by country and sector. This paper presents an overview of the SHDB development and features, as well as results from a pilot study conducted on strawberry yogurt. This study, one of seven Social Scoping Assessments mandated by The Sustainability Consortium, identifies the potential social hotspots existing in the supply chain of strawberry yogurt. With this knowledge, companies that manufacture or sell yogurt can refine their data collection efforts in order to put their social responsibility performance in perspective and effectively set up programs and initiatives to improve the social conditions of production along their product supply chain.","[Benoit-Norris, Catherine; Norris, Gregory] New Earth, York Beach, ME 03910 USA; [Benoit-Norris, Catherine; Cavan, Deana Aulisio] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Benoit-Norris, C (corresponding author), New Earth, POB 507, York Beach, ME 03910 USA.",catherine.benoit@earthster.org; deana.aulisio@unh.edu; greg.norris@earthster.org,,,,,,,25,203,218,5,128,,,,2071-1050,,,,,SEP,2012,4,9,,,,,1946,1965,,10.3390/su4091946,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su4091946,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, we find that smart supply chain practices stimulate corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure, contributing to heightened transparency and subsequently bolstering ESG metrics within firms. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the positive impact of smart supply chain management on ESG performance is particularly notable in firms led by female executives, those offering substantial stock incentives, companies operating in less competitive industries, and organizations situated in regions with strong Confucian influence. Furthermore, this study provides actionable insights for firms seeking to advance their ESG initiatives.","[Qiao, Penghua; Xie, Yusha] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China; [Fung, Anna] Amer Univ, Management Dept, Kogod Sch Business, Washington, DC USA; [Feng, Keyou] Univ Bristol, Business Sch, Bristol, England; [Fung, Hung-Gay] Univ Missouri, Coll Business Adm, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",Kunming University of Science & Technology; American University; University of Bristol; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Qiao, PH (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China.",oldbridge1221@126.com; xieyusha@163.com; afung@american.edu; keyou.feng@bristol.ac.uk; fungh@umsl.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71702084]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [21A10674001, 17YJC630112]; Natural Science Foundation of Yunan Province [202201AT070175]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Natural Science Foundation of Yunan Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants No. 71702084] , the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [21A10674001, 17YJC630112] , and the Natural Science Foundation of Yunan Province [Grant No. 202201AT070175] .",,91,0,0,44,44,,,,1057-5219,1873-8079,,,,JAN,2025,97,,,,,,,,103868,10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103868,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103868,,DEC 2024,,"Business, Finance",,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explore a setting where a port provides blockchain service with different service levels. We extend the existing literature, which discusses the servitization with blockchain in the maritime supply chain. We demonstrate both the economic and environmental benefits that blockchain service increases the operational efficiency of the port by paperless. Moreover, the port can be realized the reduction on congestion through different supply chain capacities. In addition, we find the rational strategy, including the changes in cost structure, profitability with the time reduction, the value of blockchain service in the market segment, consumer surplus, and social welfare, and the relationship between blockchain service and congestion, respectively. Furthermore, this study embodies the potential contributions of three aspects. Specifically, we reveal the role of blockchain service in the operational time of port with information transformation from paper documents to e-documents. Moreover, we find that the governance strategy of servitization with blockchain service is based on economic benefit and environmental benefits. Finally, we provide a new method to solve port congestion in the maritime supply chain. Therefore, from the perspective of management insight, the port needs to improve the operational efficiency through the blockchain technology with paperless to help consumers to increase the service experience. In addition, the port should also be concerned about the role of blockchain service in the environmental protection and port congestion. In this case, the port can adjust the strategy in order to satisfy the requirements of every stakeholder.","[Zhao, Huida; Liu, Jiaguo] Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Maritime Econ & Management, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiyuan] China Acad Transportat Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Dalian Maritime University; China Academy of Transportation Sciences,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Sch Maritime Econ & Management, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.;Hu, XY (corresponding author), China Acad Transportat Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",liujiaguo@gmail.com; 36297442@qq.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [71774019]; Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2020-HYLH-30]; Cultivation Program for the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Dalian Maritime University [0143210271],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation; Cultivation Program for the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Dalian Maritime University,"The authors would like to thank editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

The case of soy in the Brazilian Cerrado,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,Sustainable supply chains; Deforestation-risk commodities; Trade; Environmental governance; Conservation policy,LAND-USE; CONSERVATION POLICIES; SOCIAL EQUITY; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; GOVERNANCE; EFFICIENCY; GEOGRAPHY; MATTERS; GREEN,"Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable development that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.

The extraction and parts of the transport and processing of these minerals take place in the Global South and often bear high human rights and environmental risks. A lack of traceability in mineral supply chains makes it particularly difficult to hold companies accountable for negative environmental and social impacts of their operations and those of their suppliers. This paper analyses three mineral supply chains (copper, platinum, and gold) in order to develop propositions about how supply chain-specific characteristics affect traceability and foreign corporate accountability (FCA) in mineral supply chains. The analytical framework focuses on three dimensions: geopolitical dynamics, industry characteristics, and private governance mechanisms. The authors argue that chain-specific characteristics may foster or thwart traceability and FCA in mineral supply chains and thus provides a novel contribution to the debate on traceability and accountability in mineral supply chains.","[Schoeneich, Svenja; Saulich, Christina; Mueller, Melanie] Stiftung Wissensch & Polit, Ludwigkirchpl 3-4, D-10719 Berlin, Germany; [Schoeneich, Svenja] Witzlebenstr 3, D-14057 Berlin, Germany",,"Schöneich, S (corresponding author), Witzlebenstr 3, D-14057 Berlin, Germany.",svenja.schoeneich@web.de,,,,,,,76,5,5,11,34,,,,1748-5983,1748-5991,,,,OCT,2023,17,4,,,SI,,954,969,,10.1111/rego.12527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rego.12527,,MAY 2023,,Law; Political Science; Public Administration,,Government & Law; Public Administration,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

There however still lacks a comprehensive method to quantitatively evaluate supply chain sustainability risk taking into account the triple bottom line of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). This study develops a framework to evaluate supply chain sustainability risk by measuring supply chain-wide operational risk, social risk, and environmental risk to form an aggregate metric. A set of indicators readily available in literature are used to represent various aspects of supply chain sustainability risk. Risk assessment space and materiality analysis are then used to prioritize resource allocation among supply chain stages from two distinct perspectives for mitigating supply chain sustainability risk. Two case studies are provided to demonstrate the application of the developed framework, representing two main types of supply chain structure. The apparel industry example represents the deep-structure supply chain driven by relatively simple products, while the automotive industry example represents the broad-structure supply chain driven by more complex products. While the case studies focus on industry-level assessment for demonstration purpose, the developed framework can be flexibly applied to evaluate supply chain sustainability risk for specific companies in any industry.

Yet these approaches are limited in their ability to support the sustainability governance of agricultural supply chains, whether because they are intended for coarser-grained analyses, do not identify individual actors, or are too costly to be implemented in a consistent manner for an entire region of production. Here we illustrate some of the advantages of a complementary middle-ground approach that balances detail and scale of supply chain transparency information by combining consistent country-wide data on commodity production at the sub-national (e.g. municipal) level with per shipment customs data to describe trade flows of a given commodity covering all companies and production regions within that country. This approach can support supply chain governance in two key ways. First, enhanced spatial resolution of the production regions that connect to individual supply chains allows for a more accurate consideration of geographic variability in measures of risk and performance that are associated with different production practices. Second, identification of key actors that operate within a specific supply chain, including producers, traders, shippers and consumers can help discriminate coalitions of actors that have shared stake in a particular region, and that together are capable of delivering more cost-effective and coordinated interventions. We illustrate the potential of this approach with examples from Brazil, Indonesia and Colombia. We discuss how transparency information can deepen understanding of the environmental and social impacts of commodity production systems, how benefits are distributed among actors, and some of the trade-offs involved in efforts to improve supply chain sustainability. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of our approach to strengthen supply chain governance and leverage more effective and fair accountability systems.","[Godar, Javier; Suavet, Clement; Gardner, Toby A.; Dawkins, Elena] Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gardner, Toby A.] Int Inst Sustainabil, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Pl Louis Pasteur 3,Bte L4-03-08, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] FRS FNRS, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Stockholm Environment Institute; Universite Catholique Louvain; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Godar, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",javier.godar@sei-international.org,,,"Swedish Research Council Formas [2012-1401, 2013-1571]; Swedish EPA (Naturvardsverket); SIDA; Norden Top-level Research Initiative",Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish EPA (Naturvardsverket); SIDA; Norden Top-level Research Initiative,"JG and TG acknowledge support from the Swedish Research Council Formas (grants 2012-1401 and 2013-1571).

We address this question by broadening stakeholder and institutional perspectives to investigate how customers, sustainability culture, management, and external stakeholders influence companies' acceptance of social sustainability in their supply chains. We collected information on 356 apparel and footwear manufacturers from 5 South Asian countries that sell to customers in Western Europe and North America. Our findings highlight the interdependence of organizational and institutional structures and define the boundaries of GVC governance mechanisms within a social sustainability framework. Our research shows that the success of examining social sustainability interventions applied by leading firms or the effects of collaboration-based global value chains depend on the supplier's local institutional framework. Social sustainability organizational practices influence supplier perceptions and responses to key corporate needs in the supplier's country. We demonstrate that GVC governance models are most conducive to suppliers' social sustainability implementation when contextualized with the local institutional needs for social sustainability in the supplier's country.","[Zhang, Minglai] Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Sch Appl Technol, Lianyungang 222042, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhijia] Nanjing Vocat Univ Ind Technol, Sch Business & Trade, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China",Jiangsu Ocean University; Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology,"Zhang, ML (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Sch Appl Technol, Lianyungang 222042, Peoples R China.",2018000048@jou.edu.cn; chenzj@nitt.edu.cn,,,,,,,59,3,3,5,37,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,JUL,2023,30,35,,,,,83587,83599,,10.1007/s11356-023-28103-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-28103-w,,JUN 2023,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite a growing body of research on blockchain-based technologies, the relationship between these two mechanisms for supply chains remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims at addressing this research gap and explaining their interaction. We described and assessed 16 cases of blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards against twelve sustainability-related assessment criteria. The results show that the relationship between blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards can be coexisting, synergistic, and antagonistic. While most cases fall under the co-existing relationship, we identified a few cases with synergistic relationships, and one case with an antagonistic relationship. We explain each type of relation and show how the system architecture and goal of a blockchain-based technology implementation are key determinants of this relationship. This study can support stakeholders in agro-food supply chain in better understanding the application of blockchain-based technologies for sustainability governance in relation to existing voluntary sustainability standards.

Nevertheless, empirical research investigating the effects of firm-level relational embeddedness on network-level transparency still lags. Drawing on social network analysis, this research examines the effect of relational embeddedness on supply chain transparency and the contingent role of digitalization in the context of environmental, social and governance (ESG) information disclosure.Design/methodology/approachIn their empirical analysis, the authors collected secondary data from the Bloomberg database about 2,229 firms and 14,007 ties organized in 107 extended supply chains. The authors employed supplier and customer concentration metrics to measure relational embeddedness and performed multiple econometric models to test the hypothesis.FindingsThe authors found a positive effect of supplier concentration on supply chain transparency, but the effect of customer concentration was not significant. Additionally, the digitalization of focal firms reinforced the impact of supplier concentration on supply chain transparency.Originality/valueThe study findings contribute by underscoring the critical effect of relational embeddedness on supply chain transparency, extending prior literature on social network analysis, providing compelling evidence for the intersection of digitalization and supply chain management, and drawing important implications for practices.","[Feng, Bo; Zheng, Manfei; Shen, Yi] Soochow Univ, Res Ctr Smarter Supply Chain, Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"Feng, B (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Res Ctr Smarter Supply Chain, Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",neu_fengbo@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72172101],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Bo Feng thanks the support of research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72310107001); Yi Shen thanks the support of research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72172101).

It aimed to: 1) evaluate green supply chain performance based on financial indicators and corporate's ESG performance; 2) use the entropy weight method (EWM) to determine the weight of ESG elements in green supply chain; 3) validate this ESG-based green supply chain performance using real world examples. The results showed that operational performance had the highest weight, followed by environmental performance, and profitability ranked the last. The results suggested that managers should focus more on the governance and environment rather than emphasizing short-term financial benefits. It contributes to the literature by incorporating ESG to evaluate green supply chain performance, which is the first of its kind. The results would be beneficial when people wish to select supply chain partners.

A wave of government regulationsuch as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2012) and the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015)has enhanced the legitimacy of auditing as a tool to govern labor and environmental standards in global supply chains, backed by a broad range of civil society actors championing audits as a way of promoting corporate accountability. The growing adoption of auditing as a governance tool is a puzzling trend, given two decades of evidence that audit programs generally fail to detect or correct labor and environmental problems in global supply chains. Drawing on original field research, this article shows that in spite of its growing legitimacy and traction among government and civil society actors, the audit regime continues to respond to and protect industry commercial interests. Conceptually, the article challenges prevailing characterizations of the audit regime as a technical, neutral, and benign tool of supply chain governance, and highlights its embeddedness in struggles over the legitimacy and effectiveness of the industry-led privatization of global governance.","[LeBaron, Genevieve] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England; [Lister, Jane] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Transportat Studies, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Dauvergne, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Int Relat, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Sheffield; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"LeBaron, G (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.;Lister, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Transportat Studies, Sauder Sch Business, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.;Dauvergne, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",g.lebaron@sheffield.ac.uk; jlister@mail.ubc.ca; peter.dauvergne@ubc.ca,,,UK ESRC [ES/N001192/1]; Canadian SSHRC [410-2009-1741]; JRF; ESRC [ES/N001192/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Canadian SSHRC(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); JRF; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank the UK ESRC [grant number ES/N001192/1], Canadian SSHRC [grant number 410-2009-1741], and JRF for research funding.",,63,122,125,4,48,,,,1474-7731,1474-774X,,,,,2017,14,6,,,,,958,975,,10.1080/14747731.2017.1304008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2017.1304008,,,,"International Relations; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,International Relations; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

ESG performance has become an essential business strategy. This study examines the combined effect of carbon tax, emissions trading systems (ETS), and ESG initiatives of a sample semiconductor company. We use a multi-objective mixed integer programming (MOMIP) model to investigate the production, carbon emissions, and job creation for the global supply chain of an Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM). This study examines how an IDM's ESG initiative affects facility location selection, machine procurement, profit, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We apply the proposed MOMIP model to a supply chain network of global semiconductor manufacturers. An example of an illustrative IDM company is used to validate the model's effectiveness. The results suggest that adopting ESG strategies does not significantly increase costs in the supply chain while reducing carbon emissions and increasing job creation. Therefore, semiconductor manufacturing companies benefit from ESG management and should put more resources into promoting it. This study contributes to the literature on developing a framework to assess ESG management in the global semiconductor supply chain.

These include production process adjustment advice and implementation of different sustainable product standards. In practice two different approaches are taken. Development projects focus on enabling farmers to adjust their practices to Organic, Fairtrade and other standards requirements. In international trade, buyers from developed countries implement separate supply chain assurance systems. This article presents nine case studies of practices from both approaches in the cotton supply chain in India. The results show improvements in the livelihoods of small farmers but increased market access depends on what approaches are used. The future challenge is to combine the different approaches, creating market links and enhancing supply chain efficiency while providing development support at community levels. With such a balance it will be possible to assure project sustainability and maximize long-term economical, environmental and social benefits.

Since such scandals call attention to activities harmful to sustainable development, it is very important to study the relationships between concerns for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), sustainability, and organisations' market value. The added value of our study is, first, to explore SSCM controversies as drivers of or pressures for adopting and applying sustainability practices; and, second, to contribute to the recent but growing literature that analyses the channels through which SSCM and sustainability practices influence the firm's value. We introduce sustainability environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a mediator between SSCM controversies and market value to examine whether SSCM controversies with firms' stakeholders lead to improvements in the ESG dimensions of organisational sustainability. We also examine the relationships between the ESG dimensions and market value, measured as Tobin's Q ratio. The results confirm both the positive relationships of SSCM controversies to the ESG dimensions two years later and a positive relationship of the dimension of governance to Tobin's Q. We also confirm a negative and significant relationship of the social dimension to Tobin's Q, and a non-significant relationship of the environmental dimension to Tobin's Q.","[Tamayo-Torres, Ignacio; Gutierrez-Gutierrez, Leopoldo; Ruiz-Moreno, Antonia] Univ Granada, Dept Management, Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Ruiz-Moreno, A (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Management, Granada, Spain.",aruizmor@ugr.es,,,,,,,98,69,70,18,177,,,,0020-7543,1366-588X,,,,JUN 3,2019,57,11,,,,,3719,3734,,10.1080/00207543.2018.1562248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2018.1562248,,,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The S-LCA Guidelines and numerous authors have recommended generic assessment in this first phase of an S-LCA. In an effort to identify the social hotspots in the supply chains of 100 product categories during just a few months' time, adopting a streamlined approach was essential. The Social Hotspots Database system was developed by New Earth over 5 years. It includes a Global Input Output (IO) model derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project, a Worker Hours Model constructed using annual wage payments and wage rates by country and sector, and Social Theme Tables covering 22 themes within five Social Impact CategoriesLabor Rights and Decent Work, Health and Safety, Human Rights, Governance and Community Impacts. The data tables identify social risks for over 100 indicators. Both the ranking of worker hour intensity and the risk levels across multiple social themes for the Country Specific Sectors (CSS) within a product category supply chain are used to calculate Social Hotspots Indexes (SHI) using an additive weighting method. The CSS with the highest SHI are highlighted as social hotspots within the supply chain of the product in question. This system was tested in seven case studies in 2011. In order to further limit the number of hotspots, a set of prioritization rules was applied. This paper will review the method implemented to study the social hotspots of the 100 product categories and provide one detailed example. Limitations of the approach and recommended research avenues will be outlined.","[Norris, Catherine Benoit] New Earth, York, ME 03909 USA; [Norris, Gregory A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Aulisio, Deana] Univ New Hampshire, Environm Res Grp, Durham, NH 03824 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

This article explores how governance arrangements relate to these challenges by focusing on how public and private procuring organizations interpret, use, develop and combine mandatory and voluntary policy instruments. This is theorized in terms of responsible governance of transnational supply chains (RGSC) as well as regarding the combination of vertical and horizontal governance (VG and HG). The article focuses on chemical risks in the textile sector, and is based on findings from case studies of Swedish public and private procuring organizations, with additional interviews with actors engaged in developing various policy instruments. The article shows how mandatory and voluntary policy instruments can - in various ways and combinations - assist in chemical risk management, but also highlights the existence of considerable limitations and gaps, which users need to develop a reflective awareness about. The article reveals different conditions for public and private procurers, and the conclusion includes suggestions on how to bridge the gap between private and public actors. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing that combinations of HG and VG arrangements promote constructive and feasible pathways towards RGSC, but which needs reflective and constructive efforts among actors with insight, willingness and capabilities to create governance linkages.

Drawing on the Belief-Action-Outcome framework, we posit that the motivation of individuals (employees, managers, and the leadership) within the firm to access, use, and act on the environmental information available to them would be enhanced by the firm's implementation of AEIs, resulting in more extensive environmental disclosure by the firm. Additionally, building on the literature on supply chain networks, we posit that the structural position of the firm vis-a-vis its supply network-reflecting information flows, network learning, and status-moderates the AEI implementation-environmental disclosure relationship. To test our hypotheses, we build a multi-industry dataset of 3,106 firm-year observations based on 67,809 dyadic cost-of-goods-sold-based relationships obtained from Bloomberg's supply chain relationships database to construct the supply networks of focal firms. We also draw on Bloomberg's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data for our AEI implementation and environmental disclosure measures. We find significant evidence to support our hypothesis that AEI implementation is positively associated with the extent of environmental disclosure. However, the implementation of both internal and external forms of AEIs has a more pronounced positive relationship with the extent of environmental disclosure, compared to the implementation of either form alone. With regard to supply network structure, we identify three principal variables-accessibility, control, and interconnectedness-that influence network learning and status of the focal firm and find that they moderate the AEI implementation-environmental disclosure relationship. We provide insights for theory and practice based on our findings.","[Bellamy, Marcus A.] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Dhanorkar, Suvrat] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, State Coll, PA USA; [Subramanian, Ravi] Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Boston University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Bellamy, MA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",bellamym@bu.edu,,,,,,,169,85,86,97,502,,,,0272-6963,1873-1317,,,,OCT,2020,66,7-8,,,SI,,895,932,,10.1002/joom.1114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joom.1114,,,,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this regard, innovation in products, organizational structures, and business methods can be the key to achieving economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how sustainable-oriented innovations (SOI) can influence inter-organizational relationships in sustainable supply chain management. The research is based on two case studies of Brazilian focal companies (Braskem and Mercur) and their respective suppliers and customers. We have identified different realities regarding operational aspects, supply chain structure, and the strategic orientation for sustainability. The cases outlined provide in-depth insights into the forms of SOI, i.e. product and organizational innovations. A practical implication includes the illustration of how the sustainability innovations allow the reaping of positive effects to businesses along the supply chain. Collaborative relationships with suppliers and buyers can be seen as a source of learning, development of new technology processes, and information acquisition. We position our research within the realm of sustainable SCM as a contribution to the increasingly discussed relationship dimensions and present links to the sustainable innovation literature, which is rarely amalgamated with the SCM discipline. This establishes a more concrete connection, where further research at this intersection would be required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Government environmental regulation is an important policy to promote the development of the remanufacturing industry. In this paper, we study the government levies recycling and disposal fees on original products for environmental governance and establish two game models based on the perspective of maximizing social welfare with no government regulation and a tripartite liability system. The optimal decisions on wholesale, retail prices and quantity of original and remanufactured products, as well as the recycling and disposal fee are analyzed under both models. Based on the numerical results, the impact of the main parameter (such as the responsibility sharing ratio) on the decisions and profits of the parties is discussed. The results show that (1) the wholesale and retail prices of remanufactured products are not affected by government regulation; (2) the tripartite liability system can increase the output of remanufactured products and reduce the output of original products while cutting the profits of remanufacturing supply chain members, and increasing social welfare; (3) government's optimal recycling and disposal fee is not related to the sharing ratio. The study can provide practitioners with suggestions for ways to develop environmental regulation.","[Jiang, Xiao; Hu, Qiang; Zuo, Wenjin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Zhejiang Coll, Jinhua 321013, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lou, Tingyuan; Li, Jicai] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Xingzhi Coll, Jinhua 321100, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang Normal University,"Lou, TY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Xingzhi Coll, Jinhua 321100, Peoples R China.",jiangxiao0714@shufe-zj.edu.cn; huqiang@shufe-zj.edu.cn; tingyuanlou@zjnu.edu.cn; z2019108@shufe-zj.edu.cn; ljc@zjnu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [22BGL120]; Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Planning of Zhejiang Province, China [23NDJC055Z]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education, China [19YJA630033]; National Statistical Science Research Project of China [2021LY100]; Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, China [Y202044420]; Postgraduate Innovation Foundation of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [CXJJ-2022-415]; Provincial and Ministerial Level and Above Research Foundation of Zhejiang College, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Planning of Zhejiang Province, China; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education, China; National Statistical Science Research Project of China; Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, China; Postgraduate Innovation Foundation of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Provincial and Ministerial Level and Above Research Foundation of Zhejiang College, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China","This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China, grant number 22BGL120; the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Planning of Zhejiang Province, China, grant number 23NDJC055Z; the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education, China, grant number 19YJA630033; the National Statistical Science Research Project of China, grant number 2021LY100; the Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, China, grant number Y202044420; the Postgraduate Innovation Foundation of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, grant number CXJJ-2022-415.

Design/methodology/approach To investigate the intriguing links among sustainability motives, compliance/commitment and sustainable performance of supplying firms, this paper draws on multidisciplinary literature and collects empirical data from 281 supplying firms in China to test the proposed model and hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings Instrumental and moral motives make comparable contributions to compliance; moral motives exert stronger influence on firms' commitment to sustainable practices. In addition, although compliance has a greater impact on economic and environmental performance, commitment is far more robust in improving environmental and social performance. Research limitations/implications - Unlike most research on motives that has been theoretical, this study represents one of the few empirical analyses of how motives may affect sustainable performance. Examining the challenges from the perspectives of supplying firms, it also adds to the SSCM literature by making clear how compliance and commitment may differentially predict sustainable performance. Practical implications - Although instrumental and moral motives can be complementary in advancing sustainable practices, it is imperative for firms to integrate moral considerations into sustainability decision-making and move beyond compliance, if they are to contribute meaningfully to a better society and cleaner environment. Originality/value This is the first large-scale empirical investigation on the links among motives, compliance, commitment and sustainable performance from the perspectives of suppliers.","[Chen, Yinfei] Jiangsu Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Injazz J.] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",Jiangsu University; University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Chen, IJ (corresponding author), Cleveland State Univ, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",chenyinfei@ujs.edu.cn; i.chen@csuohio.edu,,,Humanity and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of P.R.

For the agri-food sector, multiple instruments have been developed to green supply chains. Yet little is known about the underlying process and conditions under which green sourcing concerns lead to the adoption of specific sustainability instruments among agri-food companies. This study: i) offers a synthesis of the most commonly used instruments agri-food companies adopt to promote sustainability in their supply chains; ii) proposes an analytical framework to elucidate how those decisions are made, based on the competitive environment in which firms operate with respect to location of their raw materials, technologies available to their suppliers, leverage over upstream suppliers, and end-markets' characteristics; and iii) presents seven case-studies illustrating the decision-making process leading to the adoption of a specific instrument by a particular company. Companies that do not have sustainable technologies available to improve their environmental practices but operate in highly sensitive places are better off taking their operation somewhere else. But companies with available cleaner technologies, effective law enforcement and control over the supply chains, as well as a brand to protect, can capitalize on their environmental efforts by introducing strict standards, such as third-party certifications. Enforcement of social and environmental regulations at countries of origin is a key factor that deters companies form adopting very strict standards, even if they have a brand value to enhance. The multiplication of private labels and initiatives are, in most cases, not driven by a desire to disorient the consumer, but rather by a careful consideration of the complex conditions under which agri-food supply chains operate. With minor adaptations, the framework could be applied to other economic sectors that have environmental impacts, from mining and energy-generating industries, to apparel, and electronics.

Transparency in the food supply chain is essential to guarantee food quality and provenance to all users of food and food products. Intensified information exchange and integrated information systems involving all chain actors are needed to achieve transparency with respect to a multitude of food properties. In this paper, specific challenges of food supply chains are highlighted. Major elements are addressed that support transparency to consumers, the government and food companies, which are considered the claimants of transparency. Elements considered to be enablers of transparency are governance mechanisms, quality and safety standards and information exchange. The paper specifies these transparency claimants and enablers for food supply chains and identifies major information system functions and information technology applications needed to comply with transparency demands.

Based on a dual-channel collecting structure, this study constructs six supply chain decision models considering two corporate social responsibility (CSR) implementers and three channel leadership structures. The findings reveal that in the SSC with a channel leader, it is most beneficial for the game follower to implement CSR from the perspective of maximising the total benefit to the supply chain and social welfare. The selection of the optimal channel leadership hinges on the trade-off between the collecting cooperation fees and the degree of the member's CSR implementation. Finally, this research proposes a revenue-responsibility sharing contract to achieve the perfect coordination of the SSC. Our results can function as guidelines for establishing an environmental-friendly SSC system.","[Liu, Shan] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Duan, Caiquan; Qiao, Jinyou] Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China; [Duan, Caiquan] Northeast Agr Univ, Postdoctoral Stn Agr & Forestry Econ Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan] Oxford Brookes Univ, Business Sch, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Fudan University; Northeast Agricultural University - China; Northeast Agricultural University - China; Oxford Brookes University,"Duan, CQ (corresponding author), Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China.;Duan, CQ (corresponding author), Northeast Agr Univ, Postdoctoral Stn Agr & Forestry Econ Management, Harbin 150030, Peoples R China.",duancaiquan@neau.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [22BJY240],National Social Science Fund of China,This research is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant Number 22BJY240).,,69,0,0,0,0,,,,0399-0559,2804-7303,,,,MAR 31,2025,59,2,,,,,907,937,,10.1051/ro/2025021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/ro/2025021,,,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Cao, WB; Tao, XY",,,,"Cao, Wenbin; Tao, Xiaoyu",,,A Study on the Evolutionary Game of the Four-Party Agricultural Product Supply Chain Based on Collaborative Governance and Sustainability,SUSTAINABILITY,,,,Article,,,,,,agricultural product supply chain; quality and safety supervision; collaborative governance; NGOs; four-party evolutionary game,STANDARDS,"To address the pressing challenges of quality and sustainability in agricultural product supply chains, this paper proposes a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance framework. Adopting the perspective of collaborative governance and sustainability, the paper develops an evolutionary game model of the Chinese agricultural product supply chain. This model involves four key stakeholders: agricultural enterprises, the government, NGOs, and consumers. It integrates sustainability principles to ensure that the decisions of each stakeholder contribute to the quality and safety of agricultural products while also promoting long-term environmental and social well-being. The simulation results demonstrate the critical importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration in strengthening governance and promoting sustainability. Based on these findings, the government is advised to implement technology-driven oversight mechanisms, such as AI-based inspections and blockchain traceability. Additionally, a tiered penalty system should be established, escalating penalties for repeat offenders. Regulatory cost-sharing mechanisms can also help ensure continuous enforcement without imposing excessive financial burdens on any single party. NGOs play a vital role in exposing corporate violations and can be more effective through targeted financial support and crowdsourced monitoring platforms. Consumers, as active participants in governance, should be incentivized with reward-based reporting systems and verified compliance feedback, which influence enterprise reputation. Public-private sustainability partnerships and real-time transparency platforms can further facilitate active participation from all stakeholders. By implementing these measures, the regulatory framework can evolve from traditional enforcement to a dynamic, data-driven governance model, fostering long-term sustainability and risk reduction in agricultural production.","[Cao, Wenbin; Tao, Xiaoyu] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University,"Cao, WB (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China.",caowb@jiangnan.edu.cn; 6220910038@stu.jiangnan.edu.cn,,,,,,,54,0,0,8,8,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB,2025,17,4,,,,,,,1762,10.3390/su17041762,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17041762,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

China, as the leading global producer of traction batteries, faces significant challenges with the social risks associated with battery technologies, particularly Nickel Cobalt Manganese batteries (LiNixCoyMnzO2), which require substantial amounts of critical raw materials. Previous studies have investigated social risks using supply chain data with assumptions, neglecting the actual supply chain in China. Additionally, they have overlooked the upstream indirect impacts. To address these gaps, this study employs social life cycle assessment to evaluate the potential social risks along the global raw material supply chain for different NCM batteries in China. It identifies Governance, especially corruption, as a significant social impact along the supply chain, with aluminum from Guinea being the major hotspot. Recycling can mitigate nearly 37 % of these risks despite the involvement of chemical reagents. NCM 811 can reduce total social risks by over 40 % compared to NCM 111 and decrease China's social risk impact on other countries and regions by 46 %, primarily due to its higher energy density. Notably, 12 % of the total impacts are upstream indirect impacts, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive supply chain analysis. In addition, potential social risks are allocated to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to explore their impact on sustainability. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) is significantly affected by NCM battery raw material acquisition, underscoring the influence of raw material acquisition on sustainability.","[Gong, Wenjing T.; Daigo, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Dunuwila, Pasan; Daigo, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol RCAST, Tokyo, Japan; [Dunuwila, Pasan] Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka; [Sun, Xin] China Automot Technol & Res Ctr Co Ltd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Daigo, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, LCA Ctr Future Strategy, UTokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University Sri Jayewardenepura; University of Tokyo,"Daigo, I (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",daigo@material.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) [JPNP20009, JPNP23002]; Project to Promote Industry-Government-Academia Collaboration to Expand the Use of Recycled Materials in Automobile Recycling by the Ministry of Environment, Japan; Ministry of Environment, Japan","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)); Project to Promote Industry-Government-Academia Collaboration to Expand the Use of Recycled Materials in Automobile Recycling by the Ministry of Environment, Japan; Ministry of Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This article is based on results obtained from the projects, JPNP20009 and JPNP23002, commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) , and Project to Promote Industry-Government-Academia Collaboration to Expand the Use of Recycled Materials in Automobile Recycling founded by the Ministry of Environment, Japan.",,58,0,0,2,2,,,,2352-5509,,,,,MAY,2025,55,,,,,,146,156,,10.1016/j.spc.2025.02.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2025.02.018,,FEB 2025,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, relatively little research has been conducted on the extent to which corporations have integrated sustainability principles into the management of their supply chain and the evaluation of supplier performance. The purpose of this article is to explore the extent to which corporate sustainability principles are integrated into supply chain management (SCM) in corporations. Canada is used as a case study in this article. The study included a content analysis of one hundred Canadian corporate sustainable development reports and in-depth interviews with 18 Canadian experts on SSCM. The article highlights the wide array of ways in which Canadian corporations address SSCM issues. Amongst other topics, issues associated with supply chain governance, standards for SSCM, collaboration with suppliers, performance measurement, and accountability within the supply chain are explored. The findings reveal that there are many challenges in integrating sustainability into SCM. These challenges shed light on possible future directions for research in SSCM. This article underlines the need for research that reflects the interconnected nature of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability, particularly as it relates to measuring supplier performance on sustainability initiatives.","[Morali, Oguz] Ryerson Univ, YSGS, Environm Appl Sci & Management ENSCIMAN Program, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Searcy, Cory] Ryerson Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Morali, O (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, YSGS, Environm Appl Sci & Management ENSCIMAN Program, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",oguz.morali@ryerson.ca; cory.searcy@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,203,184,213,8,187,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,OCT,2013,117,3,,,,,635,658,,10.1007/s10551-012-1539-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-012-1539-4,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

By further examining the ESG dimensions, our study reveals an asynchronous pattern in firms' performance enhancements. Specifically, supplier financial violations significantly boost client firms' social and governance performance, while state ownership attenuates the positive relationship between supplier financial violations and governance performance. Ultimately, our study establishes a crucial link between the conduct of stakeholders within the supply chain and the firm ESG performance.

This study examines whether such institutionalization has occurred in the coffee sector, the commodity with the most widespread adoption of certified products and over 30 years' experience of private governance, and tests hypotheses on facilitating and inhibiting conditions. It finds that while norm generation around responsible supply chain management and the organizational institutionalization of standard-setting bodies is well advanced, the practice of internalizing social and environmental externalities through the routinized production and purchase of higher priced certified goods continues to be questioned by industry actors. Indeed, conditions that favored normative and organizational institutionalization, such as high levels of industry concentration, product differentiation, and deliberative interaction, are shown to represent barriers to the practice-oriented institutionalization of market-driven regulatory governance.","[Grabs, Janina] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Grabs, J (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",janina.grabs@uni-muenster.de,,,"Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Kultur und Wissenschaft, through junior research group TRANSSUSTAIN","Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, Ministerium fur Kultur und Wissenschaft, through junior research group TRANSSUSTAIN","The author wishes to thank the editors of Regulation & Governance and the anonymous referees, as well as Graeme Auld, Benjamin Cashore, Thomas Dietz, Bernard Kilian, and Joost Pierrot, for constructive feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

Focusing on capture fisheries in the US and in the UK, we explore the roles of key actors and analyze the dynamics within and between actor groups through a cultural model derived from semi-structured interviews. We argue that the Sustainable Seafood Movement is different from previous social movements in that, in addition to actors advocating for government reform, it has motivated supply chain actors to participate in non-state market driven governance regimes. The movement and its actors have leveraged their legitimacy and authority garnered within the supply chain to increase their legitimacy and authority in public governance processes.

There have been few considerations of supply chains and enterprise characteristics included in previous research. This paper focuses on the supply chains of brand-name products, and systematically identifies principal factors that influence environmentally destructive behaviors in the supply chain of brand-name products from internal and external viewpoints of the supply chain. Considering the characteristics of the polluting industries, 416 valid questionnaires were obtained by investigating the supply chain of brand-name products in chemical, mechanical, food, and agricultural products, the light industry, and other industries. The results show that: (1) environmentally destructive behavior is differently exhibited in different industries among the investigated supply chains of brand-name products; (2) the enterprises' attitudes, policies, and investments in pro-environment approaches play a fundamental role in the environmental management of the brand-name products supply chain; (3) environmental legislation and public supervision have significant effects on the environmental management of the brand-name products supply chain; (4) only when environmental regulation is combined with environmental legislation and public supervision is a restriction of environmentally destructive behavior in the supply chain of brand-name products triggered. Thus, we suggest that the attribution and sharing mechanisms of environmental responsibility in the supply chain of brand-name products should be established; a push-pull-anchor mechanism and coordinated co-governance supervision system for environmentally destructive behavior in the supply chain of brand-name products should be built.","[Xie, Tao; Du, Jianguo; Boamah, Kofi Baah; Xu, Lingyan; Ma, Mingyue] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Xie, Tao] Nanjing Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hongjing Ave, Nanjing 211167, Peoples R China; [Boamah, Kofi Baah] Univ Profess Studies, Dept Banking & Finance, Accra, Ghana",Jiangsu University; Nanjing Institute of Technology,"Du, JG; Boamah, KB (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China.;Boamah, KB (corresponding author), Univ Profess Studies, Dept Banking & Finance, Accra, Ghana.",jgdu2005@163.com; kofibaahboamah@yahoo.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [22AGL028]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72174076, 71974081]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [22GLA007, 21GLB016]; Special Research Project of Emergency Management School in Jiangsu University [KY-A-04, KY-C-05]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Special Research Project of Emergency Management School in Jiangsu University,This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 22AGL028); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72174076 and 71974081); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. 22GLA007 and 21GLB016); Special Research Project of Emergency Management School in Jiangsu University: KY-A-04 and KY-C-05.,,76,0,0,3,17,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR,2023,15,5,,,,,,,4605,10.3390/su15054605,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15054605,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This limitation is a barrier to more sustainable production and consumption of animal products. In this study, we combine life cycle thinking with an environmental justice approach to map Costco's beef supply chain in California and to explore the environmental burden of air pollution (PM2.5) due to beef production in the San Joaquin Valley, a region that has some of the worst air quality in the United States. To map the supply chain of one of Costco's primary suppliers, Harris Ranch, and the feedlots they operate, the study uses a methodological framework known as Tracking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST). Our modeling revealed that feedlots produce similar to 95% of total PM2.5 emissions across the beef supply chain, and they alone account for approximately 1/3 of total anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in the Valley. PM2.5 concentrations are markedly higher around these facilities. The spatial analysis revealed that communities living near feedlots are often poor, predominantly Latinx and have increased PM2.5 related disease burdens, including asthma, heart disease and low weight birth. Based on company documents and news reports, neither Costco nor Harris Ranch are addressing this environmental injustice. Documenting the geographically specific impacts of livestock production opens up opportunities for corporations to address environmental injustices in their supply chains through more sustainable sourcing and production practices, and for consumers to rethink their consumption of meat.

This paper discusses research progress as well as various issues and complexities associated with using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the performance of multinational enterprises (MNE) and emerging market multinationals (EMNEs). Design/methodology/approach The paper identifies emerging literature that focuses on tracking the development and uptake of ESG ratings in the international context. It discusses three emerging research streams: Research examining the ESG-financial performance relationship in emerging markets, research tracking the ESG performance of multinationals in the various countries and regions they are operating, and frameworks for assessing ESG-related risks on a country level. Findings While the emerging body of work adds an important dimension to the identification and awareness of ESG issues globally, numerous unresolved issues become evident. ESG frameworks have been built to assess corporate sustainability as it relates to firms in their home countries (typically with a focus on developed countries), with limited applicability and transferability to emerging markets. International firm activities are often not captured in detail and not comprehensively mapped across firm subsidiaries and a firm's corporate supply chain where ESG issues are prone to happen, and ESG scores do not comprehensively integrate views and voices from various local stakeholders that are impacted by firm activities, particularly indigenous communities. Research limitations/implications Research on ESG ratings in the context of multinational business research is generally sparse and fragmented, thus creating opportunities for future research to expand on existing and emerging findings. Practical implications The paper creates awareness of issues to consider when using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the ESG performance of MNEs and EMNEs: ESG scores can be subject to bias and are not weighted by materiality, which can be misleading for portfolio construction and performance measurement purposes. Managers need to be aware that ESG scores are often not capturing ESG issues occurring in supply chains and ESG issues affecting local communities. Originality/value This study enriches the understanding of ESG in the context of multinational business research practice.","[Linnenluecke, Martina K.] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Corp Sustainabil & Environm Finance, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Linnenluecke, MK (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Ctr Corp Sustainabil & Environm Finance, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",martina.linnenluecke@mq.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP200102332]; Australian Research Council [DP200102332] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council (DP200102332).,,69,53,57,33,495,,,,1525-383X,2054-1686,,,,MAR 23,2022,30,1,,,,,1,16,,10.1108/MBR-11-2021-0148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MBR-11-2021-0148,,FEB 2022,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency.","[Gualandris, Jury] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada; [Longoni, Annachiara] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Luzzini, Davide] EADA Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Pagell, Mark] Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); EADA Business School; University College Dublin,"Gualandris, J (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada.",jgualandris@ivey.ca,,,,,,,119,101,104,184,1036,,,,0272-6963,1873-1317,,,,OCT,2021,67,7,,,,,803,827,,10.1002/joom.1150,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joom.1150,,JUN 2021,,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, firms' internal emissions reduction may create a leakage leading to higher emissions in the supply chain. The related literature suggests that the pollution-haven hypothesis explains such emissions leakage. In contrast, we explore an alternative reason for supply chain leakage, which is related to optimization of supply chain activities and supply chain innovation. Based on panel data from Bloomberg Environmental, Social, and Governance and Bloomberg Supply Chain, we estimate our models at a dyadic (i.e., firm and supplier) level using two-way cluster-robust standard error, treating various sources of endogeneity. We find empirical evidence of a supply chain leakage effect-a higher level of a supplier's emissions is associated with a lower level of a firm's internal emissions. More importantly, the supplier's innovation can be a major reason behind the leakage; the supply chain leakage effect is stronger when a supplier is more innovative. Furthermore, the role of innovation is strengthened when a supplier invests in eco-innovation and has technological capabilities similar to those of the focal firm. Our findings suggest that supply chain leakage may not be completely driven by the pollution-haven effect, but instead is associated with supply chain optimization and innovation that may be beneficial in the long run.","[Song, Sining] Univ Tennessee Knoxville, Haslam Coll Business, Dept Supply Chain Management, Knoxville, TN USA; [Dong, Yan] Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Dept Management Sci, Columbia, SC USA; [Kull, Thomas; Carter, Craig] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Dept Supply Chain Management, Tempe, AZ USA; [Xu, Kefeng] Univ Texas San Antonio, Carlos Alvarez Coll Business, Dept Management Sci & Stat, San Antonio, TX USA; [Dong, Yan] Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Dong, Y (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",Yan.Dong@moore.sc.edu,,,,,,,113,15,17,96,346,,,,1059-1478,1937-5956,,,,MAR,2023,32,3,,,,,882,903,,10.1111/poms.13904,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/poms.13904,,NOV 2022,,"Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, our study distinguishes between structural and process dimensions of relational governance mechanisms so as to facilitate a more nuanced investigation into the inherent complementarities and performance implications. Using data collected from 145 US firms and a combination of methodologies - three-stage least squares and structural equation modelling, a number of direct, complementary and mediation effects are hypothesised and tested. The three-stage least squares methodology was adopted to overcome endogeneity and simultaneity issues inherent in the hypotheses covering complementarity. Contrary to conventional wisdom, structural and process governance mechanisms were not found to act as complements for environmental collaboration. Instead, the effect of structural mechanisms was found to be completely mediated by the process mechanisms. Thus, process mechanisms of relational governance were found to be much more important in promoting advanced practices such as environmental collaboration. Our results also document the significant mediating role of environmental collaboration.

An overview is provided of the issues associated with a broadening of accounting needed for sustainable supply chains. The paper highlights: ongoing problems of scope and terminology, lack of a broad sustainability focus because of complexity which stunts the impact on decision makers, and the need for transdisciplinary teams to increase connectedness and performance of the supply chain. The need for further research relating to three issues is identified. First, who undertakes the accounting for supply chains; second, why should a business function account for supply chain involvement; and, third, what information is relevant to different functional managers?

The study finds that strengthening supply chain resilience and enhancing ESG performance both contribute to sustainable corporate growth. The mediation analysis indicates that supply chain resilience accelerates corporate growth by optimizing the production process through improved total factor productivity, whereas ESG performance promotes corporate growth by alleviating financing constraints and broadening funding sources. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of supply chain resilience varies among companies of different sizes and production factors. Specifically, the positive effects of supply chain resilience are more pronounced in small and technology-intensive firms. Similarly, the role of ESG performance varies depending on whether the CEO holds dual roles and at different stages of the corporate life cycle. In companies without dual CEO roles and during the growth phase of a company, ESG performance has a more significant positive impact on corporate growth.","[Lin, Yuya] Hainan Vocat Univ Sci & Technol, Haikou 571126, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Li, Shoubo] Wuzhou Univ, Sch Management, Wuzhou 543002, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Hainan Vocational University of Science & Technology; Wuzhou University,"Li, SB (corresponding author), Wuzhou Univ, Sch Management, Wuzhou 543002, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",kjlw2024@163.com; limiler@163.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,92,92,,,,1059-0560,1873-8036,,,,JAN,2025,97,,,,,,,,103763,10.1016/j.iref.2024.103763,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2024.103763,,DEC 2024,,"Business, Finance; Economics",,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aspect of ESG that enhances firm viability remains uncertain, as does whether this aspect varies across firms that exhibit distinct supply chain concentrations (SCCs). Clarifying these issues is essential for companies' attempts to tailor their ESG portfolios in the context of operations to suit their unique circumstances and to improve supply chain viability. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to examine these issues. Our study utilizes data regarding Chinese listed firms to conduct an empirical assessment of how ESG affects stock market performance in response to the increase in COVID-19 cases both within China (the national outbreak) and at the global level excluding China (the global pandemic). The results reveal that a significant decline in stock returns occurred as COVID-19 cases increased. Firms that exhibited higher levels of preexisting ESG performance were associated with a less pronounced decrease in stock returns during the national outbreak. Notably, environmental and social responsibilities emerged as key protective factors in response to the national COVID-19 outbreak, while corporate governance proved to be more effective with regard to addressing the global pandemic. In addition, our study reveals that the safeguard provided by environmental and social responsibilities functions as a form of insurance primarily among low-SCC firms.

A review of existing literature about supply chain visibility reveals that there are two essential forces at work, namely (1) collaborative behavior - i.e., firms willing to share information with supply chain partners in order to leverage social capital, and (2) opportunistic behavior - i.e., firms wanting to maintain some degree of information asymmetry in order to manage the behaviors of their supply chain partners. In order to identify the antecedents of IOS visibility, our operational definition of supply chain visibility, the two theories - resource dependence theory (RDT) and relational view (RV) - are used to cobble together a set of variables in a framework to investigate their relationships to IOS visibility. The data used in this study was collected from 124 intermediate component manufacturers in three different manufacturing industries. The results show that IOS visibility positively influences overall supply chain performance, as measured by operational performance. Regarding the antecedents of IOS visibility, factors including asset specificity, interorganizational trust, complementary resources, and joint governance structures are significant, whereas environmental uncertainty and interdependence are not significant.

Furthermore, an analysis of the first experiences with the implementation of the French Duty of Vigilance law, which covers and gives equal weight to environmental and human rights risks, reveals that the inclusion of environmental and human rights standards in legal norms is not sufficient to ensure policy integration. The empirical focus here is on the soy and beef supply chains from Brazil to the European Union (EU), and the findings rely on an analysis of legal norms and company reports, field research at producing sites in Brazil and semi-structured interviews with civil society, business and state actors. For analyzing the data, I draw on the literature on environmental policy integration (EPI) and apply a framework that distinguishes between institutional, political and cognitive factors to discuss advances and challenges for integrating human rights and the environment in sustainability governance.

Despite its critical importance, the relationship between coordination mechanisms and sustainability performance remains underexplored. This study examines the interrelations between transactional characteristics, relational and formal coordination, and sustainability performance in agri-food supply chains. By surveying 204 farmers and 135 downstream players across diverse supply chain arrangements, this research employs structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis to analyze data suitability and test hypotheses. The empirical findings reveal nuanced relationships: relational governance has a significantly positive connection to economic and social sustainability within supply chains. There is also a positive, indirect relation between relational governance and ecological performance through the promotion of resource efficiency. Formal coordination practices facilitate strategic relationships and efficient resource allocation and as such connect to social and economic viability of supply chains. Transaction costs play a role as mediator between formal and relational coordination, and sustainability outcomes. Effective management of transaction costs can mitigate inefficiencies and foster collaborative efforts. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and stakeholders can develop strategies to promote resilience and sustainability in global food systems.","[Moreno-Miranda, Carlos] Tech Univ Ambato, Fac Food Engn & Biotechnol, Ambato, Ecuador; [Moreno-Miranda, Carlos; Dries, Liesbeth] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidad Tecnica de Ambato; Wageningen University & Research,"Moreno-Miranda, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Ambato, Fac Food Engn & Biotechnol, Ambato, Ecuador.;Moreno-Miranda, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",cs.moreno@uta.edu.ec,,,Universidad Tecnica de Ambato.,Universidad Tecnica de Ambato.,This study was supported by Universidad Tecnica de Ambato.,,97,0,0,9,9,,,,0742-4477,1520-6297,,,,2024 DEC 15,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/agr.22003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.22003,,DEC 2024,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examines how supply chain collaboration challenges have been addressed in CE research. Based on a systematic literature review, we demonstrate that, despite being emphasized as fundamental to the advance of a CE, supply chain collaboration suffers from various constraints. The ability to select partners and develop a trustworthy relationships is rare and has implications for the success and continuity of collaboration. We also find that the principles of circularity are not always observed and that several studies present isolated circular practices in a linear logic. In view of these results, we prepare propositions regarding the incorporation of social and governance capabilities in the transition and further improvement process of a circular economy. There are many obstacles to a CE model, and the collaborative capabilities of selected partners are important factors that deserve more attention from managers.","[Berardi, Patricia Calicchio] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, LEPABE Lab Proc Engn Environm Biotechnol & Energy, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Berardi, Patricia Calicchio] CELOG Ctr Excelencia & Logist & Supply Chain EAES, Av 9 Julho 2029,11 Andar, BR-01313902 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Brito, Renata Peregrino] Pontificia Univ Catolica PUC Rio, IAG Business Sch, Rua Marques Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade do Porto,"de Brito, RP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica PUC Rio, IAG Business Sch, Rua Marques Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",pberardi@fe.up.pt; renata.brito@iag.puc-rio.br,,,FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) [UIDB/00511/2020]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) [001],FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"This work was financially supported by: Basic Funding -UIDB/00511/2020 of the Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy -LEPABE -funded by national funds through the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC).

As the world focuses on ESG investments, the media shed light on ESG controversies or concerns, such as tax frauds and harmful products. These controversies place companies at risk and consequently harm their sustainable development. Using a unique supply chain dataset from McDonald's Corporation, this study (i) develops a two-stage efficiency evaluation framework with a metafrontier range directional model in data envelopment analysis (DEA) and (ii) examines the relationship between DEA efficiency scores and ESG and ESG controversy scores through regression analysis. Results show that research and development efficiency (0.910) contributes more to overall efficiency than to profitability efficiency (0.700). While ESG scores positively impact efficiency, ESG controversies exert a negative effect, except for companies with ISO14000 environmental management certification. This study not only reinforces stakeholder theory by highlighting the critical role of ESG practices in enhancing company efficiency and stakeholder engagement but also provides actionable insights for policymakers and management teams to foster sustainable development through strategic ESG investments and partnerships. Overall, this study underscores the importance of examining stakeholder engagement in achieving sustainable development goals by managing financial and R&D resources, investing in ESG, and addressing ESG controversies among supply chains.","[Kweh, Qian Long] Canadian Univ Dubai, Sch Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Lu, Wen-Min] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Int Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ting, Irene Wei Kiong; Chunya, Ren] Univ Malaysia Pahang Al Sultan Abdullah, Fac Ind Management, Pahang, Malaysia",Canadian University Dubai; Chinese Culture University; Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA),"Ting, IWK (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Pahang Al Sultan Abdullah, Fac Ind Management, Pahang, Malaysia.",qlkweh@gmail.com; wenmin.lu@gmail.com; irene@umpsa.edu.my; chunyaren@gmail.com,,,,,,,71,1,1,16,16,,,,1387-585X,1573-2975,,,,2025 JAN 25,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-025-05999-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-025-05999-7,,JAN 2025,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

BANK; INVENTORY; RISK; INCENTIVES; DISCLOSURE; INSPECTION; CONTRACTS; AUDIT,"Companies have increasingly used supply chain financing instead of bank financing when engaging with financially constrained suppliers. We investigate the effectiveness of different financing mechanisms at supporting supply chain responsibility. We consider a decentralized supply chain where a buyer sources from a financially constrained supplier who borrows from either a bank or the buyer to finance his production. The buyer audits the supplier for responsibility compliance and will refuse to accept and pay for the order if the supplier fails the audit. We find that under conventional bank financing, the bank is concerned with the supplier's audit failure and will raise the interest rate. This not only hinders the supplier's compliance effort but also hurts the profitability of every stakeholder. In contrast, under buyer financing, the buyer may offer the supplier a low interest rate to motivate him to be more compliant when the supplier's collateral is of low value. However, if the supplier's collateral is of high value, the buyer may be tempted to set a high interest rate to exploit the supplier-leading to a reduction in supplier's compliance and supply chain profitability. Thus, we conclude that buyer (bank) financing is more preferable for encouraging responsibility when the supplier has low (high) collateral. Our findings suggest that buyer financing may not always be an effective approach for encouraging supply chain responsibility. As such, we propose an alternative mechanism under which the buyer offers a reward to the supplier if he passes the audit while the supplier continues to borrow from a bank. We prove that this combination of bank financing and buyer reward always improves the compliance level and in most cases increases the total supply chain profit. It is even more effective than buyer financing in encouraging responsibility especially when the supplier's collateral is of low value.","[Chen, Xiaole] Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Vernon N.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Business Sch, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lai, Guoming] Univ Texas, McCombs Sch Business, Austin, TX USA; [Li, Yang] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada; [Li, Yang] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Li, Y (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",yangli@ivey.ca,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72201283]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council's General Research Fund [CUHK14506221],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council's General Research Fund,"The authors thank the department editor Albert Ha, the senior editor, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

It is an experimental, numerical analysis carried out in an Indian industrial setting to derive some empirical truths, which have profound implications for the community of professional practice and academic and policy research towards inclusiveness in ecological governance. The analysis is centred on a conceptual model based on causal interdependencies. This model conceives stakeholders' demands from the outside in the form of numerous environmental, economic and social externalities triggering pressures for integrating innovative sustainable responses in logistics operations in the supply chain to eventuate desirable state transformation of the society, environment and economy. The model, as proposed, is validated through primary data collected through a structured questionnaire survey from Indian logistics service providers (LSPs) and analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM) with coding in the R engine platform. The empirical result shows that sustainable performance is influenced less by green practices than logistics operations, and the direct impact of logistics operations is much less on green practices than on supply chain sustainability. This study attempts to study contemporary sustainability practices. It transcends to contribute towards regenerative inclusive human welfare, adding the scope of activity from merely environmental management to sustainability in ecological governance.","[Roy, Supriyo] Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Ranchi, India; [Mohanty, R.

While there is growing evidence about the environmental effectiveness of these commitments (i.e., whether they meet their conservation goals), there is little information on how they influence producers' opportunity to access sustainable markets and related livelihood outcomes, or how design and implementation choices influence tradeoffs or potential synergies between effectiveness and equity in access. This paper explores these research gaps and makes three main contributions by: i) defining and justifying the importance of analyzing access equity and its relation to effectiveness when implementing forest-focused supply chain policies such as ZDCs, ii) identifying seven policy design principles that are likely to maximize synergies between effectiveness and access equity, and iii) assessing effectiveness-access equity tensions and synergies across common ZDC implementation mechanisms amongst the five largest firms in each of the leading agricultural forest-risk commodity sectors: palm oil, soybeans, beef cattle, and cocoa. To enhance forest conservation while avoiding harm to the most vulnerable farmers in the tropics, it is necessary to combine stringent rules with widespread capacity building, greater involvement of affected actors in the co-production of implementation mechanisms, and support for alternative rural development paths.","[Grabs, Janina; Cammelli, Federico; Levy, Samuel A.; Garrett, Rachael D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Grabs, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",janina.grabs@gess.ethz.ch,,,"SNF [100017_192373]; ERC [949932]; National Science Foundation [1739253]; BU Global Development Policy Center; ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100017_192373] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1739253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [949932] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","SNF; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); BU Global Development Policy Center; ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","JG, FC, and SL were supported by startup funds provided to RG through ETH Zurich; in addition, JG was supported by SNF Grant #100017_192373; FC was supported by ERC Grant #949932; and SL was supported by National Science Foundation award #1739253 and the BU Global Development Policy Center.

We analyze how companies in the agri-food sector have complied with the law as well as the emergence of new accountability dynamics. We find that while companies have improved their due diligence systems over time, they enjoy much discretion to interpret their obligations according to a managerial logic and to disclose information selectively. Nevertheless, the DV law has contributed to new accountability dynamics, wherein civil society can use civil liability to pressure companies to comply.

J,"Hong, ZX; Xiao, K",,,,"Hong, Zexin; Xiao, Kun",,,Digital economy structuring for sustainable development: the role of blockchain and artificial intelligence in improving supply chain and reducing negative environmental impacts,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,,,Article,,,,,,Sustainable development; Environmental degradation; Supply chain management; Blockchain; Artificial intelligence; Circular economy,INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT,"In the current global context of environmental degradation and resource constraints, the pursuit of sustainable development has become an imperative. One avenue that holds promise for achieving this objective is the application of digital technologies, which have the potential to decouple economic growth from its carbon footprint. However, it is crucial to ensure that these technologies are designed and governed in a prudent manner, with a strong alignment to environmental priorities. This study focuses on exploring the potential roles of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain coordination and impact mitigation. Furthermore, they have the capacity to incentivize recycling and circular business models, as well as facilitate carbon accounting and offsetting. To fully realize these benefits, it is essential to deploy these technologies within inclusive collaborative frameworks that take into consideration social and ecological considerations. The study also offers policy recommendations that highlight key leverage points for digital innovation, enabling countries to embark on smart and green industrial transformation pathways. By harnessing the potential of blockchain and AI in supply chains, governments can promote transparency, traceability, and accountability, thereby fostering sustainable practices and reducing environmental impacts. Incorporating blockchain and AI technologies into supply chain approaches leads to a substantial improvement in efficiency, as demonstrated by a numerical analysis. In conclusion, the integration of innovative digital technologies offers significant opportunities to optimize production systems and economic activity while prioritizing sustainability objectives for the betterment of society and the environment. These technologies have the potential to mitigate environmental externalities by addressing information imbalances within global supply chains. However, it is essential to prioritize inclusive governance that emphasizes democratic participation to mitigate any unintended negative consequences, especially for vulnerable communities. By ensuring inclusive decision-making processes, we can maximize the positive impact of these technologies while minimizing potential harm.","[Hong, Zexin] Minzu Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hong, Zexin] Beijing Financial St Inst, Beijing 100032, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Kun] CHEK, Beijing 110000, Peoples R China",Minzu University of China,"Hong, ZX (corresponding author), Minzu Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Hong, ZX (corresponding author), Beijing Financial St Inst, Beijing 100032, Peoples R China.",22400033@muc.edu.cn,,,,,,,71,15,15,47,115,,,,2045-2322,,,,,FEB 16,2024,14,1,,,,,,,3912,10.1038/s41598-024-53760-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53760-3,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Business sustainability enables the integration of financial economic sustainability performance and non-financial environmental, social, ethical, and governance sustainability performance dimensions into the corporate culture, supply chain management and business models in creating shared value for all stakeholders. Business literature has provided mixed evidence of the tension, and possible link, between financial and non-financial sustainability performance dimensions and sustainability theories have yet to sufficiently address this tension. This paper attempts to fill this void by shedding light on the link between various dimensions of sustainability performance, their integrated effect on creating shared value for all stakeholders and their implications for supply chain sustainability. This paper examines the synergy between business sustainability and supply chain management by presenting a framework consisting of sustainability theories, sustainability performance dimensions, sustainability shared value concept, and sustainability best practices. Companies can use the suggested framework in integrating both financial and non-financial sustainability initiatives into their supply chain sustainability from production design, purchasing and inbound logistics, and manufacturing process to distribution and outbound logistics.","[Rezaee, Zabihollah] Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, 300 Fogelman Coll Adm Bldg, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Memphis,"Rezaee, Z (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Fogelman Coll Business & Econ, 300 Fogelman Coll Adm Bldg, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",zrezaee@memphis.edu,,,Thompson-Hill Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis,Thompson-Hill Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis,The funding grants from the Thompson-Hill Chair of Excellence at the University of Memphis in support of this research paper is greatly appreciated.,,78,49,56,7,77,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JAN,2018,10,1,,,,,,,275,10.3390/su10010275,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10010275,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review has been conducted, with an analysis of 123 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals published from 1998 up to March 2018. Findings Through analysis and synthesis of the literature, this paper identifies and classifies the concepts of SCL into four types, that is, process orientation, structure orientation, consequence orientation and other informal definitions. Based on the Extended Resource-Based View (ERBV), the authors develop an integrated conceptual framework, which brings together various constructs. Within the framework, the authors identify the drivers and sources of SCL at intra- and inter-organizational levels. SCL consists of exploratory and exploitive learning capabilities, and the outcomes of SCL are dynamic supply chain management capabilities and sustainable supply chain performance. Originality/value The authors propose a capability perspective of SCL and develop a conceptual model and a number of associated propositions of SCL based on the ERBV and review findings, which is subject to future empirical testing and propose five future research directions. The findings of this paper can be extended beyond the dyad and be applied in multi-tier supply chain context.","[Yang, Yang; Xu, Zhiduan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Jia, Fu] Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England",Xiamen University; University of York - UK,"Xu, ZD (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",yang2535@foxmail.com; fu.jia@york.ac.uk; zhiduanx@xmu.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences project [17YJA630034]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2017J01519],Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences project; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province),The authors appreciate the financial support from The Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences project (Grant number: 17YJA630034) and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (No. 2017J01519).,,256,97,103,9,152,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,MAR 11,2019,24,2,,,,,189,214,,10.1108/SCM-11-2017-0359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-11-2017-0359,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The UK State is developing policy strategies to tackle these public health problems alongside intergovernmental responses. However, the governance of food supply chains is conducted by, and across, both private and public spheres and within a multilevel framework. The realities of contemporary food governance are that private interests are key drivers of food supply chains and have institutionalized a great deal of standards-setting and quality, notably from their locations in the downstream and midstream sectors. The UK State is designing some downstream and some midstream interventions to ameliorate the public health impacts of current food consumption patterns in England. The UK State has not addressed upstream interventions towards public health diet at the primary food production and processing stages, although traditionally it has shaped agricultural policy. Within the realities of contemporary multilevel governance, the UK State must act within the contexts set by the international regimes of the Common Agricultural Policy and the World Trade Organization agreements, notably on agriculture. The potential for further upstream agricultural policy reform is considered as part of a wider policy approach to address the public health externalities issuing from contemporary food supply chains within this multilevel governance context.","City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1V 0HB, England","City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London","Barling, D (corresponding author), City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1V 0HB, England.",d.barling@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,25,28,2,33,,,,1187-7863,1573-322X,,,,,2007,20,3,,,,,285,300,,10.1007/s10806-007-9034-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-007-9034-0,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Ethics; Environmental Sciences; History & Philosophy Of Science",,Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; History & Philosophy of Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies suggest that more attention is needed to uncover aspects of the governance of these transitional models. In this systematic literature review, we attempt to close this gap by reviewing 55 papers from 2010 to 2020. Using frameworks borrowed from the public administration literature on collaborative governance, we explore the main elements of collaborative governance, including leadership, collaboration processes, starting conditions, and institutional designs. We then suggest opportunities for future research in the study of local food systems. The literature also accounts for key factors that facilitate or make collaboration difficult. Our findings indicate that the local food systems literature is rich in descriptions of actors and alternative institutional designs. However, far less research addresses leadership in local food supply chains and how we should measure outcomes. We conclude with suggestions for further research.","[Kang, Hyewon; Luna-Reyes, Luis F.] Rockefeller Coll Publ Adm & Policy, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Roggio, April M.] Rockefeller Coll Publ Adm & Policy, Ctr Policy Res, Albany, NY USA",,"Luna-Reyes, LF (corresponding author), Rockefeller Coll Publ Adm & Policy, Dept Publ Adm & Policy, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",hkang4@albany.edu; aroggio@albany.edu; lluna-reyes@albany.edu,,,,,,,93,16,18,4,30,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,MAR 1,2022,338,,,,,,,,130626,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130626,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130626,,JAN 2022,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little research, however, links green supply chain (GSC) to companies' business performance. This paper uses top brands' micro-data and the Corporate Information Transparency Index (CM) developed by environmental non-governmental organizations to explore the causal relationship between GSC behavior and business performance in China. Based on a big database, the CITI can be used to reflect the GSC behaviors of selected brand enterprises by tracking which brand enterprises choose the products of hundreds of thousands of polluting enterprises as raw materials. The results show that GSC behavior measured by the CITI has a significant positive impact on the business performance measured by both return on assets and return on main business. Using the Baidu index as an instrumental variable for the CITI and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, the causal relationship is still robust. Furthermore, we investigate the influence mechanism of the CITI on the business performance. We find that a greater board size and female proportion in the board tend to have negative effects on a company's green supply chain decision-making, while a company whose chief executive officer holds a PhD degree is more willing to choose greener supplier.","[Li, Guangqin; Shao, Shuai] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Finance & Econ Res, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Li, Guangqin] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Jiyang Coll, Zhuji 311300, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lihong] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool L3 5UG, Merseyside, England",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang A&F University; University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University,"Shao, SA (corresponding author), 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",shao.shuai@sufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773075, 71373153]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province in China [LY18G030014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province in China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),We acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71773075 and 71373153) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province in China (No. LY18G030014).,,63,48,50,14,177,,,,0040-1625,1873-5509,,,,JUL,2019,144,,,,,,445,455,,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.014,,,,Business; Regional & Urban Planning,,Business & Economics; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims at overcoming these limitations of traditional rating systems by proposing an integrated model of supply chain rating, based on both financial and non-financial variables and including environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators to embrace a long-term orientation of value creation. Enlarging the scope of evaluation from the single company to its supply chain, we realize an integrated ESG - financial model which evaluates both financial and sustainability aspects of organizations, based on the supply chain they belong to. This model is especially useful for evaluating the potential growth of small and medium enterprises which, differently from large corporations, are usually more opaque to financial markets, and present lower disclosure intensity. Therefore, this measurement system can be adopted by both financial institutions, to evaluate potential borrowers, and individual companies, to make internal assessments or to evaluate the performance of their downstream and upstream partners.","[Sardanelli, Domenico; Bittucci, Lucilla] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Management, Rome, Italy; [Mirone, Francesco] Mercatorum Univ, Dept Management, Rome, Italy; [Marzioni, Stefano] Luiss Guido Carli Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Universita Telematica Mercatorum; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Sardanelli, D (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Management, Rome, Italy.",domenico.sardanelli@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,64,18,18,29,190,,,,1478-3363,1478-3371,,,,2022 MAY 6,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/14783363.2022.2069557,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14783363.2022.2069557,,MAY 2022,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several databases have been selected here for the assessment: the UN Comtrade database, the global industrial robotics database, and the World Bank database covering the period of 2000 to 2019. This particular study examines the effect and mechanisms of AI on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability and explores the spatial spillover effects of AI in neighboring countries. The relevant findings are threefold. Firstly, the analysis of the mechanism of action demonstrates that AI can alleviate renewable energy supply chain vulnerability through technological innovation, governance system optimization, and trade network status promotion effects. Secondly, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that AI significantly alleviates renewable energy supply chain vulnerability in middle-income countries, highvulnerability products, countries with high popularity of digital infrastructure, and countries in the initial stage of renewable energy industrial development. Thirdly, the spatial econometric results show that AI can directly alleviate domestic renewable energy supply chain vulnerability and indirectly alleviate vulnerability in neighboring countries through spatial spillover effects. This study expands the methods for identifying the impact of external environmental changes on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability. It provides an empirical reference for policymakers and professionals to maintain the security, stability, and reliability of renewable energy supply chains in the AI era.","[Song, Yuegang; Wang, Ziqi; Song, Changqing] Henan Normal Univ, Xinxiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianhua] Changshu Inst Technol, Changshu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Rong] Qingdao City Univ, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Henan Normal University; Changshu Institute of Technology,"Wang, JH (corresponding author), Changshu Inst Technol, Changshu, Peoples R China.",wjhsz35@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation [20BJY091]; Innovative Talents in Philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities and Colleges in Henan Province [2022-CXRC-29]; National Social Science Fund's Primary Project Research [21ZD084]; Major Programs of Philosophy and Social Science Research for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [2022SJZD065],National Social Science Foundation; Innovative Talents in Philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities and Colleges in Henan Province; National Social Science Fund's Primary Project Research; Major Programs of Philosophy and Social Science Research for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Social Science Foundation (The impact of heterogeneity of regional trade in services agreements on the reconstruction of the global value chain of China's Manufacturing Industry; Project No: 20BJY091) and Innovative Talents in Philosophy and Social Sciences in Universities and Colleges in Henan Province (Project No: 2022-CXRC-29) and National Social Science Fund's Primary Project Research on the internal mechanism and realization path of the strategic linkage between urban and rural integration and the new development pattern (Project No: 21ZD084) and Major Programs of Philosophy and Social Science Research for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (Project No: 2022SJZD065).,,73,18,18,102,176,,,,0140-9883,1873-6181,,,,MAR,2024,131,,,,,,,,107357,10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107357,,FEB 2024,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strategic interactions in digital twin-enabled sustainable semiconductor supply chain,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS,,,,Article,,,,,,Environmental; Social; And governance (ESG); Sustainable semiconductor supply chain; Decision-making; Fairness concerns; Evolutionary game,EVOLUTIONARY GAME ANALYSIS; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; MODEL,"Spatial-temporal visibility and traceability in the digital twin enable semiconductor supply chain great transparency and efficacy, but also poses challenges to information disclosure. There is growing evidence that investment in digital twin technology is becoming crucial for improving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and mitigating risks within a sustainable semiconductor supply chain. Nonetheless, how fairness concerns impact the decision-making processes among different stakeholders remains inadequately understood. This paper presents an analytical analysis of the dynamic strategic interplay among semiconductor manufacturers, consumers, and government regulatory agencies (GRAs) utilizing the evolutionary game model. The aim is to investigate how long-term ESG strategies and fairness-oriented behaviors respond to government incentives. The findings imply that substantial investment demands can dissuade semiconductor manufacturers from delivering ESG services, while low tax rates may lead to their complacency and a subsequent lack of investment in ESG initiatives. Meanwhile, semiconductor manufacturers are more inclined to provide ESG services when the order loss ratio is low, and the tax rate is high, with strict regulations further amplifying this probability. Furthermore, consumers valuing fairness and equity tend to give positive feedback for basic services but is critical of ESG services due to issues with transparency in digital twin technologies. Addressing these issues extends beyond the scope of market incentives alone, requiring interventions from third parties such as government regulations, policy incentives, and enhanced data security measures.","[Zhang, Mengdi; Yang, Wanting] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Internet Things, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mengdi; Wang, Shuaian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhiheng; Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhiheng; Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Adv Mfg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhiheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Intelligent Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Zhao, ZH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zhiheng.zhao@polyu.edu.hk,,,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20220382]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52305557]; Open Fund of State Key Labora-tory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology [IMETKF2024022]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foun-dation [2024A1515011930]; RGC Theme-based Research Scheme [T32-707/22-N]; RGC Research Impact Fund [R7036-22],Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Fund of State Key Labora-tory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foun-dation; RGC Theme-based Research Scheme; RGC Research Impact Fund,"We express our gratitude to the Editor-in-Chief and the reviewers for their invaluable comments, which have greatly enhanced the quality of this article.

In this context, an emerging and relatively understudied area of interest relates to small firm industrial clusters. Local clusters offer the potential for local joint action, and thus a basis for improving local compliance on CSR through collective monitoring and local governance. This article explores the interrelationship between global governance, exercised through GVC ties, and local governance, via cluster institutions, in ensuring compliance with CSR pressures. It undertakes a comparative analysis of two leading export-oriented football manufacturing clusters in South Asia that have both faced common challenges on child labour. The article shows that both forms vertical and horizontal governance have played a part in shaping the response of the two clusters on child labour. Moreover, these two distinct forms of governance have also led to quite differentiated outcomes in terms of forms of work organization and child labour monitoring. This raises broader questions on how global CSR demands can locally be better embedded and the conditions under which football stitchers labour in these new work forms.","[Lund-Thomsen, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Nadvi, Khalid] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Copenhagen Business School; University of Manchester,"Lund-Thomsen, P (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Porcelaenshaven 18A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",plt.ikl@cbs.dk; khalid.nadvi@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,124,127,3,100,,,,0167-4544,,,,,,2010,93,,,2,,,201,222,,10.1007/s10551-010-0561-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-010-0561-7,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the post-war era, SVG built a successful banana industry under a preferential agreement with the EU. When the agreement collapsed under free trade reforms, the burden of finding new forms of reintegration fell on the state and laboring classes. The paper argues that conventional supply chain approaches have adopted a static understanding of the relationship between inclusion and exclusion, overlooking the exclusionary nature of supply chains and placing too much emphasis on assessing the possibilities for private supply chain initiatives to address their negative social and environmental impacts. The effect has been to obscure the centrality of the state and laboring classes in continuing, out of necessity, to confront, manage, and address the many costs that corporations are not willing to pay. It is their centrality to managing the uneven and unpredictable nature of supply chain integration/reintegration, that is often the most hidden of all.","[Fridell, Gavin] St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Fridell, G (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada.",Gavin.Fridell@smu.ca,,,Canada Research Chairs (CRC) program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [950-231376],Canada Research Chairs (CRC) program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),This work was supported by the Canada Research Chairs (CRC) program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) under grant number 950-231376.,,73,10,10,1,19,,,,0969-2290,1466-4526,,,,MAY 4,2022,29,3,,,SI,,749,767,,10.1080/09692290.2020.1838315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1838315,,OCT 2020,,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to analyze the impact of multinational corporations' supply chain sustainability initiatives on their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance and the moderating role of the key country-level factors of the multinational's headquarters. Design/methodology/approachThis study analyzes data published by the top 201 multinationals among Fortune Global 500 companies over the period 2011-2021 on their attempts to integrate sustainability measures in extended supply chains and the resultant impact on their ESG scores. A fixed-effect model is used in the primary empirical study. FindingsResults indicate that managerial interventions through a more robust supply chain policy framework, monitoring mechanisms, corrective actions and training initiatives lead to better ESG-environment pillar performance for multinationals. Additionally, the ESG-environment pillar performance is influenced by the socioeconomic model and country-level ESG risks of the nation where the multinational is headquartered. Originality/valueThe implications of this study are vital for understanding the criticality of sustainability initiatives in the supply chain for a firm's overall ESG performance. To attain better levels of sustainable performance, multinationals must assume a stewardship position and deploy sustainability initiatives in their extended supply chain.","[Das, Arindam] SP Jain Inst Management & Res SPJIMR, Dept Strategy & Innovat, Mumbai, India",S.

To address enterprise food fraud, it is necessary to identify the key such factors and elucidate the functional mechanisms, as well as systematic analysis of the interrelationships among clusters and factors. Hence, we grounded on a social co-governance perspective and investigated the food fraud key influencing factors and their interrelationships in an emerging food market - China, by using the DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP). Results showed that the identified key cluster was government regulation, social governance, and detection techniques. Four other key factors were also identified, including government regulatory capability and penalty intensity, expected economic benefits, maturity of market reputation mechanism, and transparency of supply chain.

While scholars agree that energy security is a major driver of China's energy policies, there is insufficient understanding of what exactly constitutes China's energy security from the policy perspective. We apply recent insights from the Global Energy Assessment, particularly the idea of vital energy systems, and the securitization theory to propose a framework for explaining China's energy security policies in their historic evolution. We pay specific attention to explaining how particular energy supply chains are constructed and securitized. We draw data from over 300 Chinese and over 100 English publications and 30 interviews with energy officials and experts in China. We demonstrate that China's focus on vulnerabilities of its oil supply chain at the expense of improving the reliability of domestic electricity supply is not accidental. It has its roots in historic events, properties of energy systems, as well as the presence of powerful institutional agents interested in securitizing the oil supply chain but not other vital energy systems. We suggest that this focus on the oil supply chain is likely to be maintained in the future, possibly accompanied by increasing concerns over natural gas supply chains. Our proposed framework for energy security policy analysis can be used for other countries and jurisdictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Leung, Guy C.

Responding to calls from the global community, companies are adopting a variety of voluntary practices to improve the environmental and/or social management of their suppliers' activities. We develop a global survey of 449 publicly listed companies in the food, textile, and wood-products sectors with annual reports in English to provide insight into how the private sector contributes to advancing the SDGs via such sustainable-sourcing practices. We find that while 52% of companies use at least one sustainable-sourcing practice, these practices are limited in scope; 71% relates to only one or a few input materials and 60.5% apply to only first-tier suppliers. We also find that sustainable-sourcing practices typically address a small subset of the sustainability challenges laid out by the SDGs, primarily focusing on labor rights and compliance with national laws. Consistent with existing hypotheses, companies that face consumer and civil society pressure are associated with a significantly higher probability of adopting sustainable-sourcing practices.

In particular, it seeks to answer the following question: what is the role of social capital in shaping the decision to adopt blockchain in supply networks? Design/methodology/approach Multiple case-studies, based on interviews performed with managers of eight firms, were used. Findings The social capital theory emerged as an additional but necessary lens to investigate blockchain implementation in supply networks. The intuitions proposed highlighted the importance of managers' sensemaking for investigating technology adoption. Relational capital emerged as a necessary but not sufficient condition to adopt blockchain in supply networks. In addition, it is argued a relationship between competitive opportunities at the firm level and the idea to adopt the blockchain. The opportunity to act as Tertius Gaudens or as Tertius Iungens information brokers in supply networks should severely affect firms' proneness toward the adoption of blockchain solutions. Originality/value This is one of the first studies in the literature investigating blockchain adoption in supply networks from a social capital perspective.

The complexity, diversity, and technicality of food safety problems are intertwined, which constantly promotes the Chinese government and the food industry to explore effective food safety governance mechanisms. As the dominant form of vertical coordination in agri-food supply chain, contract farming is conducive to promoting farmers' safe production behavior, improving food quality and safety, and ensuring public health. However, the low contract performance rate seriously restricts the effect of contract farming on reducing the risk of food safety in China. This paper empirically investigates the role of farmers' risk attitude and contract arrangements in their enforcement. The data is derived from a household survey and economic field experiment of fruit farmers participating in contract farming in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces of China. We measure farmers' risk attitude by using an economic field experiment, and examine how risk attitude and contract arrangements affect contract enforcement with a probit model. The results show that contract enforcement is significantly (1% level) influenced by farmers' risk attitude. Farmers with greater risk aversion and loss aversion and farmers who are more accurate in evaluating probability information are more likely to fulfill the contract. Additionally, most contract arrangements have a significant effect on contract enforcement at the 5% level. Contract arrangements with floor pricing, bonus, and long duration are related to a higher rate of farmers' contract performance. Furthermore, the factors influencing contract enforcement differ based on the levels of farmer' risk attitude. The findings of the study may be conducive to formulating relevant agricultural policy to influence farmers' decision-making and thus improving food safety and ensuring public health.","[Hou, Jing] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Business Sch, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bo] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Philosophy & Publ Adm, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangsu Normal University; Jiangnan University; Jiangsu Normal University,"Wu, LH (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",houjing@jsnu.edu.cn; wlh6799@jiangnan.edu.cn; houbo@jsnu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [17CGL044],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 17CGL044].,,40,13,13,5,53,,,,,1660-4601,,,,APR,2020,17,8,,,,,,,2733,10.3390/ijerph17082733,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082733,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,"gold, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The findings indicate that (1) the city's GSC pilots significantly enhance enterprises' performance in terms of green innovation; (2) the positive impact of the city GSC pilots on corporate green innovation stems from heightened regulatory pressure within urban areas and increased supply chain standards; (3) this positive impact is more significant in cities with environmental laws and companies with green investors; and (4) green innovation triggered by city GSC pilots can significantly improve environmental, social, governance (ESG), and economic performance. This study offers empirical evidence for enhancing enterprises' green innovation performance, while providing theoretical support and policy insights for strengthening government-led city GSC pilot systems.","[Xu, Shulin] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Cultural Tourism & Geog, Guangzhou 510320, Peoples R China; [Liao, Feimei; Sun, Yinghao] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Finance, 99 Ziyang Ave, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi Normal University,"Liao, FM (corresponding author), Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Finance, 99 Ziyang Ave, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",linsxjn@163.com; lfm801008@163.com; 1470865810@qq.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [22BJY035]; Humanities and social sciences in universities of Jiangxi Province [GL22122],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Humanities and social sciences in universities of Jiangxi Province,The contributions of this research are the following: National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 22BJY035) and Humanities and social sciences in universities of Jiangxi Province (GL22122).,,43,16,16,22,82,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,2023 NOV 14,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10479-023-05685-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-023-05685-9,,NOV 2023,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These systems are increasingly interconnected across scales and face challenges in responding to multiple, and coalescing types of environmental, social, and economic change. Most studies on how actors respond to change have focused on farmers and farming communities. In this study, we investigate the connectivity of farming systems to markets, to understand how social relationships across the supply chain influence how actors respond to multiple types of changes. We used a participatory network mapping method to interview actors across a fruit supply chain in the Western Cape, South Africa, that is connected to both global and national markets. We identified droughts, climatic variations, changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other social shifts as the most important changes affecting the production and trade of fruit in this region. We also identified three types of responses to these changes: i) responses concerning the dynamics of trade relationships (e.g., changing or maintaining trade relationships); ii) responses based on changes at the individual level (e.g., changes in farm management); and iii) responses based on social relationships (categorized into four types, namely collaboration, knowledge transfer, financial assistance, and marketing coordination). Within these four types, we found that different types of social networks, that include actors operating at different scales and within and outside of supply chains, mediate responses to change. We also found that networks of collaboration, knowledge exchange and financial assistance show a positive correlation, where actors with an export orientation engage in multiple social relationships that enable responding to changes. However, we found limited participation of local market actors in most of these networks. Further investigating these social networks, and the actors participating in them, is essential to better understand and anticipate how and why agricultural systems respond to multiple types of changes, ultimately influencing their trajectory in an increasingly changing world.","[Gonzalez-Mon, Blanca; Mancilla-Garcia, Maria; Bodin, Orjan; Biggs, Reinette (Oonsie); Schluter, Maja] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mancilla-Garcia, Maria] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Malherbe, Willem; Sitas, Nadia; Pringle, Catherine B.; Biggs, Reinette (Oonsie)] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Transit, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Gonzalez-Mon, Blanca] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Stellenbosch University; Stockholm University,"González-Mon, B (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",blanca.gonzalez@su.se,,,"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [682,472 - MUSES]; UK Research and Innovation Grant through the Global Challenge Research Fund [ES/T003006/1]; South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI) of the National Research Foundation of South Africa [98766]; Marianne och Marcus Wallenbergs Stiftelse",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); UK Research and Innovation Grant through the Global Challenge Research Fund; South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI) of the National Research Foundation of South Africa; Marianne och Marcus Wallenbergs Stiftelse,"BG and MS received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant 682,472 - MUSES).

With a three -wave survey data collected from 205 Chinese manufacturers, the proposed theoretical model is tested through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that both formal contractual governance and informal guanxi governance have a positive effect on SSCC. However, guanxi weakens the positive effect of contractual governance. In addition, SSCC exhibits a favorable impact on firms ' social, environmental, and economic performance.

This question is approached by systematically reviewing papers at the interface of bio-energy and supply chain or logistics issues. The review conducted as content analysis is based on an analytic framework that conceives bio-energy chains between challenges and benefits of bio-energy production with simultaneous internal supply chain management and external stakeholder management needs. Smartly designed and operated bio-energy projects hold promising potentials of contributing to sustainable development by both mitigating climate change and strengthening adaptation capabilities. Our analysis distils specific strategies and success factors for tapping this potential on two levels: On a supply chain level, individually adapted and designed supply chain systems relying on trustful information exchange, cooperation and relational governance safeguard profitability while holding adverse ecological and social impacts of operation down; they allow, for instance, minimising costs and emissions, implementing new technologies, and coping with environmental uncertainties such as crop failures and volatile prices. On a stakeholder level, governments as key actors for designing the future legal framework of bio-energy are primary targets for lobbying activities of bio-energy representatives. Respective arguments may focus on economic development and job generation. By minimising its adverse impacts on society and eco-systems and by communicating these efforts credibly, bio-energy warrants its superiority over fossil energy systems. Involving NGOs and residents in early stages of bio-energy projects via transparent two-way communication considerably increase societal acceptance.","Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Int Management, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Gold, S (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Int Management, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",gold@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,111,49,53,0,63,,,,1381-2386,1573-1596,,,,APR,2011,16,4,,,,,439,462,,10.1007/s11027-010-9272-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-010-9272-8,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We apply structural equation modeling, using dyadic empirical data from 102 infrastructure projects. The overall results verify our developed model and illuminate how the interplay between contractual and relational governance, in terms of coordinative and collaborative SCI, mediates the effect of technical and organizational complexity on project performance.

The antimony industry chain is distributed among the major developed and developing countries around the world. With the development of clean energy technology, the demand for antimony in photovoltaic and energy storage fields will increase significantly. Considering the significant changes in the global demand for antimony products and the serious supply shortage, people should pay more attention to the supply risk of related products of the antimony industry chain. In this paper, we propose a new integrated index to evaluate the supply risk of antimony industry chain related products, including Herfindahl Hirschman index, global governance index, human development index, global innovation index, and betweenness centrality in complex networks. Meanwhile, seven commodities in the antimony industry chain are selected for empirical analysis from 2011 to 2019. The results show that countries with high supply risks of the industry chain upstream include Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. And, Australia, India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam are with high supply risks in the midstream of the industry chain. Meanwhile, Canada, India, Japan, and Thailand are with high downstream supply risks. Some countries, like China, the United States, and Germany, play a core role in different sectors of the industry chain. International competitive relations of countries have caused a high supply risk of products related to the antimony industry chain. The supply risk of the antimony industry chain shows that countries must strengthen industrial division and cooperation to maximize their interests. It is suggested to take the country-specific measures to mitigate supply risks, including establishing national inventories of critical materials, overseas investment, strengthening the guidance of industrial policies, and accelerating infrastructure construction.","[Li, Junhui; Xu, Deyi; Zhu, Yongguang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Deyi; Zhu, Yongguang] China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Resources & Environm Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences,"Zhu, YG (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Zhu, YG (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Resources & Environm Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",zhuyongguang@cug.edu.cn,,,"Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [21ZD106]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71991482, 72204235, 72074197, 72164002, 71991480]; Open Fund Project of Hubei Provincial Research Base for Regional Innovation Capacity Monitoring and Analysis Soft Science [HBQY 2022z11]; Major Research Projects of Guangxi Department of Natural Resources in 2019 (Sub-bid C) [GXZC2019-G3-25122-GXGL-C]",Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Fund Project of Hubei Provincial Research Base for Regional Innovation Capacity Monitoring and Analysis Soft Science; Major Research Projects of Guangxi Department of Natural Resources in 2019 (Sub-bid C),"This research was jointly sponsored by Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 21&ZD106), Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71991482, 72204235, 72074197, 71991480, and 72164002), the Open Fund Project of Hubei Provincial Research Base for Regional Innovation Capacity Monitoring and Analysis Soft Science (No. HBQY 2022z11), and the Major Research Projects of Guangxi Department of Natural Resources in 2019 (Sub-bid C) (No. GXZC2019-G3-25122-GXGL-C).",,32,11,11,30,116,,,,2296-598X,,,,,SEP 27,2022,10,,,,,,,,1007260,10.3389/fenrg.2022.1007260,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2022.1007260,,,,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use detailed farm-level data to analyse the environmental and social impacts of flower certification in Ethiopia by comparing different national and international certification schemes. Our analysis does not show significant differences between these different private standards for most environmental and health and safety variables. The Ethiopian cut flower industry remains far from improving its sustainability performance through private certification.

Amongst this criticism, Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to the industrialized agri-food supply systems. In recent years there have been some attempts to explore the relationship between SFSCs and sustainability, but these are mostly theoretical discussions and lacks empirical validation. This study, therefore, attempts to provide empirical validation of the SFSCs and sustainability linkages. Additionally, from the theoretical perspective, our work extends the traditional triple bottom line constructs and explores two extra dimensions of sustainability in the food supply chain system, namely, governance and culture, thus exploring five dimensions of sustainability. Furthermore, while SFSCs have proven to improve farmers' livelihoods and reconnect producers with consumers, little or no attention has been given to understand the consumers' attitudes towards the SFSC practices. Therefore, this study aims to explore the customers' attitudes towards participating in SFSCs through the concept of a moral economy and personal relationship. Based on the 532 valid responses from Chinese consumers, our study shows that all five pillars of sustainability, moral economy and Chinese relationship have a positive influence on consumers' participation in SFSCs. With its intuitive benefits, the economic pillar emerged as the most approved factor by the participants. Interestingly our findings show that the social aspect is less prominent than others, which is contrary to existing studies conducted in developed countries.","[Wang, Meng; Kumar, Vikas; Ruan, Ximing; Saad, Mohammed] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England; [Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Derby, England; [Kumar, Anil] London Metropolitan Univ, London, England",University of West England; University of Derby; London Metropolitan University,"Kumar, V (corresponding author), Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England.",Meng2.Wang@live.uwe.ac.uk; Vikas.Kumar@uwe.ac.uk; Ximing.Ruan@uwe.ac.uk; Mohammed.Saad@uwe.ac.uk; J.Reyes@derby.ac.uk; anilror@gmail.com,,,,,,,84,50,50,5,49,,,,1936-9735,1936-9743,,,,JUN,2022,15,1-2,,,,,76,92,,10.1007/s12063-021-00188-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12063-021-00188-x,,MAR 2021,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

More specifically, this research focuses on studying the causal relationship that exists between resilience and sustainability in the management of agri-food chains to generate valuable knowledge for the leaders of companies that have to deal with these two transformations. Through a qualitative comparative analysis methodology, taking a sample of eight Spanish distribution companies, the results obtained indicate that the strength of supply chains has a strong link to strategies to improve environmental, social and governance sustainability.

In this context, companies are increasingly held accountable for social and ecological issues that lie within the sphere of action of their suppliers and sub-suppliers. They are thus faced with the challenge of meeting these demands for transparency, traceability, and compliance with standards in their Supply Chains (SCs). Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions.","[Ebinger, Frank; Omondi, Bramwel] Nuremberg Campus Technol NCT, Dept Sustainabil Oriented Innovat & Transformat M, D-90429 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Omondi, B (corresponding author), Nuremberg Campus Technol NCT, Dept Sustainabil Oriented Innovat & Transformat M, D-90429 Nurnberg, Germany.",frank.ebinger@th-nuernberg.de; bramwel.omondi@th-nuernberg.de,,,,,,,99,67,68,6,98,,,,,2071-1050,,,,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,6129,10.3390/su12156129,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12156129,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The synergistic and miraculous role of attention to the trilogy between SCM, CSR, and the football business is crucial in creating the most advantages in society. We conclude that CSR, with the firm's Environmental, and Governance-based engagement, can lead to sustainable supply chains and higher efficiency.

There is an immediate need of decarbonisation and a push for a smooth transition to a world with no net carbon emissions. To achieve sustainability, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms are increasing their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint across their supply chains. The firms and government undertake several initiatives towards achieving the zero carbon mission. Hence, there is a need to identify the prominent enablers that may enhance the decarbonisation in the FMCG sector and contribute towards a net-zero carbon economy. The current study has identified and assessed the enablers (6 main criteria, 19 sub-criteria), including green innovation, green supply chain, sustainable decision-making, organisation decisions and government control from environment, social and governance (ESG) perspective. Eco-friendly manufacturing techniques and eco-friendly goods may give businesses a competitive edge and sustainability. The six primary factors that can help to reduce decarbonisation are evaluated using the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) technique. The criteria and sub-criteria are assessed by SWARA method. A total of 32 experts from the FMCG industry are undertaken to validate and assess the enablers. This study identified and evaluated the ESG-based decarbonisation enablers in FMCG. The study shows that green innovations are ranked first, followed by organisational decisions and government control. This is likely the first study to examine how the FMCG industry's enablers for decreasing carbon footprints connect. The study is helpful to the supply chain managers and the other decision makers to implement well-designed processes for creating new products and a supply chain from the point of purchase to the place of supply, all backed by advanced technology and the appropriate regulatory adjustments.","[Sharma, Manu; Shah, Janmejai Kumar] Graphic Era Deemed Be Univ, Dept Management Studies, Dehra Dun, India; [Sharma, Manu; Joshi, Sudhanshu] Univ Technol, Australian Artificial Intelligence Inst AAII, Sydney, Australia; [Joshi, Sudhanshu] Doon Univ, Sch Management, Operat & Supply Chain Management Res Lab, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttaranchal, India",Graphic Era University; University of Technology Sydney; Doon University,"Sharma, M (corresponding author), Graphic Era Deemed Be Univ, Dept Management Studies, Dehra Dun, India.;Sharma, M (corresponding author), Univ Technol, Australian Artificial Intelligence Inst AAII, Sydney, Australia.",sharmamanu53@gmail.com; janmejaishah99@gmail.com; sudhanshujoshi@doonuniversity.ac.in,,,,,,,43,6,6,15,123,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,JUL,2023,30,31,,,,,76718,76734,,10.1007/s11356-023-27480-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27480-6,,MAY 2023,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the implementation of a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), Chinese enterprises are faced with domestic and overseas institutional pressures, such as laws, regulations, and agenda, etc. Then, whether the dual institutional pressure has a promoting role for Chinese manufacturing enterprises in implementing the SSCM and whether the sustainable supply chain practices (SSCP) can promote the output of enterprise performance, have become a topic worthy of study. Hypothesis on the relationship between the institutional pressure of sustainable supply chain and economic, social, and environmental performances is innovatively raised in this paper and a theoretical model is built. Besides, a fitting test is conducted to a full model by using a structural equation model. An optimal model is eventually obtained after repeated modifications to the initial model by means of goodness of fit and causal path coefficient, thereby it is verified in this paper that the institutional pressure has a significantly positive impact on the SSCP; a conclusion is drawn that the impact of the SSCP on the economic, environmental, and social performances shows different characteristics, which has an important theoretical guiding role in promoting the SSCP.","[Lu, Yali; Shen, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yali; Zhao, Chenyang; Xu, Leimeng] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Management & Econ, Zhengzhou 450046, Henan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power","Shen, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",luyali@ncwu.edu.cn; 17125523@bjtu.edu.cn; xuleimengie@163.com; shenl@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771566]; Humanities and Social Science Project Funding of the Education Ministry of China [16YJC630081]; technology innovative team on water resources safety and clean energy collaborative management of Henan province (Henan provincial science and technology department),National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Project Funding of the Education Ministry of China; technology innovative team on water resources safety and clean energy collaborative management of Henan province (Henan provincial science and technology department),"(1) The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments.

New strategies are needed to achieve change in an era of increasing urgency. This paper proposes that academics study the supply chains of individual corporations and link them to environmental and social impacts in geographically specific areas. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have used this approach successfully, issuing reports about corporate activity related to deforestation, sweatshops, and other issues of social concern. But academics, by and large, have studied generic products, industries, and sectors. To verify this, after reviewing approximately 11,000 studies on supply chains, we identified just 27 academic papers that focused on individual corporations. These were primarily by NGOs and social scientists, with no studies by industrial ecologists meeting our review criteria. To uncover corporate supply chains, researchers used two distinct methodological approaches: in situ (interviews, surveys, and surveillance) and ex situ (trade data, document analysis, and maps). In this paper, we explain why and how academics should study the supply chains of individual corporations. This is done by combining approaches from industrial ecology, with those from geography, sociology, and other social sciences to develop a political-industrial ecology of supply chains. This both physically links actual product flows with their environmental impacts, and explores how they affect justice, equity, and welfare. The work we propose offers clear collaborative linkages with NGOs, industry, and the media.","[Goldstein, Benjamin; Newell, Joshua P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Goldstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",benjgo@umich.edu,,,,,,,111,16,17,1,35,,,,1088-1980,1530-9290,,,,DEC,2019,23,6,,,,,1316,1327,,10.1111/jiec.12932,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12932,,SEP 2019,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,Green Published,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Companies with high ESG scores imply that their ongoing business development is recognised to be economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable. From the current ESG measurement practice, the measurement frameworks are built on rating schemes, such as KLD and ASSET4, so as to derive the ESG scores for listed companies. However, such existing measurement frameworks are difficult to be implemented in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with unstructured and non-standardised business data, especially in logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) practice. In addition, it is inevitable for listed companies to work with SMEs, for example logistics service providers, but they need a systematic framework to source the responsible SMEs to maintain the ESG perfor-mance. To address the above industrial pain-points, this study proposes an ESG development prioritisation and performance measurement framework (ESG-DPPMF) by means of the Bayesian best-worst method enabling the group decision-making capability to prioritise the ESG development areas and formulate the performance measurement scheme. Through consolidating the opinions from logistics practitioners, it is found that fair labour practice, reverse logistics and human right in supply chains are the most essential areas to further enhance ESG capabilities in the logistics industry. In addition, the viability of the ESG performance measurement has been validated, and thus the sustainable and human-centric logistics practice can be developed to achieve business sustainability.","[Tsang, Y.

We do so by advancing an analytical framework that conceptualizes FCA and identify important contextual conditions that help to explain accountability dynamics. Applying this framework, we show that the drafting, implementation, and enforcement of such regulations are highly political processes, wherein competing ideas embedded within unequal actor constellations and institutional environments shape the possibilities to achieve more transformative change.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses case study data to examine SMEs operating in both a developing economy, the Republic of Macedonia, and a developed economy, the USA. Findings - Insights reveal that the institutional context (i.e. environmental uncertainty) has significant indirect influence on ICT use by SMEs from rule-based and relationship-based SCs in the wine industry through contractual and relational mechanisms (i.e. contracts and social bonds). Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the body of SC knowledge by providing a comparative qualitative analysis of interorganizational factors (i.e. information sharing, collaboration, trust, contractual governance, relational governance and environmental uncertainty) that influence ICT use by SMEs in upstream wine SCs from developing and developed economies. Practical implications - This paper provides valuable implications for the SC participants (e.g. grape suppliers, wineries and other suppliers) and industries (e.g. Macedonian and American wine industries) related to ICT use and non-use.

This marks one of the latest forms of transnational business governance, whereby state actors share the regulation of environmental and social externalities with private authority. This paper responds to the call for more contextual research into the complex policy ecosystems in which zero deforestation commitments are implemented and how transnational private authority is interacting with, and possibly being reconfigured by, domestic governance and territory. Combining policy analysis, field work on cocoa farms, focus groups, and over 45 interviews, this paper provides empirical evidence to explain how business commitments to zero deforestation cocoa interact with domestic political processes to reduce deforestation in key cocoa-producing countries. The focus is on three top cocoa producer countries in West Africa, where smallholder cocoa farming causes environmental degradation due to deforestation, and socioeconomic progress for smallholders is difficult to achieve. In these countries, the private sector's commitment to reduce deforestation is situated in government-led programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The findings show that a codependent relationship is evolving between corporate and state-led efforts to reduce deforestation, where the success of zero deforestation cocoa relies on synergistic public-private interaction. Cocoa intensification without expansion, supply chain traceability, and jurisdictional commodity sourcing are the three main areas of future collaboration identified.","[Carodenuto, Sophia] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, David Turpin Bldg,99111 Ring Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Carodenuto, S (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, David Turpin Bldg,99111 Ring Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",carodenuto@uvic.ca,,,UNIQUE forestry and land use; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Cameroon; Programme d'Appui a la mise en oeuvre de la strategie de developpement du secteur rural-Volet Foret Environnement (ProPFE),UNIQUE forestry and land use; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Cameroon; Programme d'Appui a la mise en oeuvre de la strategie de developpement du secteur rural-Volet Foret Environnement (ProPFE),"Research was supported by UNIQUE forestry and land use through a project supported by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Cameroon, specifically the Programme d'Appui a la mise en oeuvre de la strategie de developpement du secteur rural-Volet Foret Environnement (ProPFE).

The burgeoning demand for fast fashion, often reliant on cheap and environmentally unsustainable textiles, exacerbates this environmental degradation. To facilitate a harmonized and sustainable progression of the entire TA industry, this study employs the Stackelberg game model to investigate the prerequisites for establishing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related cost-sharing contracts and their consequential effects on supply chain coordination. Specifically, the paper compares four distinct supply chain models under two conditions: whether market demand is stochastic or deterministic. Through this comparative analysis, the study finds that the ESG related cost-sharing contracts bring more profit to the textile and apparel supply chain (TASC) in deterministic and stochastic demand, which effectively mitigates the risks associated with unpredictable demand. Numerical results indicate that the ESG cost-sharing contract significantly improves TASC's ESG performance with customers' sustainable awareness increasing. Furthermore, such contracts are instrumental in enhancing the aggregate ESG environmental performance of the Textile and Apparel Supply Chain (TASC), elevating profits for both manufacturers and retailers and alleviating the impact of fluctuating demand on supply chain participants.","[Li, Linze; Liu, Xuexin; Hu, Man] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Hu, Man] Capital Univ Econ & Business, 121 Zhangjialukou,Fengtai Area, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Hu, M (corresponding author), Capital Univ Econ & Business, 121 Zhangjialukou,Fengtai Area, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",human0104@163.com,,,Major Project of The National Social Science Foundation of China [22 ZD145]; Capital University of Economics and Business Start-up Research Grant for New Junior Faculty [XRZ2023021],Major Project of The National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Capital University of Economics and Business Start-up Research Grant for New Junior Faculty,This work was supported by Major Project of The National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant #: 22 & ZD145) and Capital University of Economics and Business Start-up Research Grant for New Junior Faculty (Grant #: XRZ2023021) .,,64,7,7,43,126,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 15,2024,437,,,,,,,,140491,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140491,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140491,,JAN 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Questionnaires were distributed via Google Forms, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized for data analysis. The results provide strong empirical evidence that government policies have a significant positive effect on sustainability dimensions related to the tourism industry. The data indicates robust positive relationships between government policies and economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Furthermore, tourism supply chain behavior is shown to be a meaningful mediator between government policies and multiple sustainability outcomes. This emphasizes the significance of collaborative efforts, responsible practices, and harmonized actions within the tourism supply chain in achieving sustainable tourism.

This article addresses this gap by specifically focusing on the RMG industry in Bangladesh, the home of the third largest RMG supplier in the world. It concentrates on analysing how and to what extent the law can assist in developing social responsibility performance of the RMG manufacturing firms in developing countries. It ultimately concludes that a new governance approach in laws can effectively increase the social responsibility practice standards of an industry where global buying firms are profit-driven and governmental agencies are either inadequate or corrupt.","[Rahim, Mia Mahmudur] Univ South Australia, Sch Law, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia,"Rahim, MM (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Law, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",miamahmud@hotmail.com,,,,,,,250,42,44,1,33,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,JUL,2017,143,4,,,SI,,807,826,,10.1007/s10551-016-3131-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-016-3131-9,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study integrates multiple theoretical lenses rooted in resource-based theory (RBT). We empirically examine the interdependencies between green servitisation innovation, green sustainable supply chain management (GSSCM) practices, Industry 4.0, technology adoption, and corporate governance structure. This study uses a mixedmethods research paradigm and multiple datasets from the UK Innovation Survey (UKIS) 2021. The empirical study is based on FTSE companies listed on the London Stock Exchange over the period (2012-2021) with 1580 firm-years observation and extracts from corporate annual reports. We find that Industry 4.0 technology adoption facilitates the integration of green servitisation innovation strategies into GSSCM. Further, the synergic effects of corporate governance structure and Industry 4.0 technologies strengthen the nexus between green servitisation innovation trajectories and GSCCM practices towards GS-OBM and ESG performance. Our results add to the empirical evidence on the complementarities between the key pillars that reinforce GS-OBM and ESG performance. The findings of this study offer insights into the contextual factors surrounding radical innovation trajectories and their impacts on GSSCM practices and corporate transformation towards GS-OBM in the UK context. The results have managerial and theoretical implications based on a holistic perspective and can be adopted by other boardrooms as a benchmark approach to corporate transformation towards GSSCM and GSOBM to maximise ESG performance.","[Alkaraan, Fadi; Gulko, Nadia] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England; [Alkaraan, Fadi] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Gulf Financial Ctr, Mubarak Al Abdullah, Kuwait; [Elmarzouky, Mahmoud] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Scotland; [Jabbour, Ana Beatriz Lopes de Sousa] Metis Lab, EM Normandie Business Sch, Le Havre, France; [Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta] NEOMA Business Sch, Mont St Aignan, France; [Gulko, Nadia] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of Lincoln; University of St Andrews; NEOMA Business School; North West University - South Africa,"Alkaraan, F (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England.;Alkaraan, F (corresponding author), Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Gulf Financial Ctr, Mubarak Al Abdullah, Kuwait.",Falkaraan@lincoln.ac.uk; mahmoud.elmarzouky@st-andrews.ac.uk; bsousajabbour@em-normandie.fr; c-j.chiappetta-jabbour@neoma-bs.fr; ngulko@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,4,4,71,71,,,,0148-2963,1873-7978,,,,JAN,2025,186,,,,,,,,115029,10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.115029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.115029,,OCT 2024,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given that BRI is a large-scale project focusing on building large-scale logistics infrastructure, it can have serious implications for sustainable supply chains from environmental and social perspectives. This study attempts to address this gap. Using a phenomeno-logical approach and conducting 36 semi-structured interviews with senior managers from five South Asian countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, and China), this study reveals that BRI can potentially harm organizations' supply chains from environmental, social, and governance perspectives.

This study examines the effect of CSR orientation incongruence on relationship performance. Drawing on the congruence theory literature, we posit that a firm's relationship performance may suffer when there is incongruence between the levels of CSR orientations of supply chain partners. Furthermore, we adopt a network perspective and argue that certain characteristics of a firm's egocentric social network (i.e., network centrality and network diversity) may moderate the linkage between CSR orientation incongruence and relationship performance. Our empirical study, which is based on dyadic data, indeed reveals that a firm's relationship performance is adversely affected when the firm and its major supply partner have incongruent levels of CSR orientations. Such a negative effect is moderated by the firm's egocentric social network. Specifically, the negative impact of incongruent CSR orientation is heightened if the firm occupies a central position in the egocentric network. Network diversity, however, plays a contrasting role as a firm's relationship performance may be less susceptible to incongruent CSR orientations when there is access to a diverse social network.","[Liu, Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xingping] Hubei Univ, Business Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xingzhi] Depaul Univ, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Koufteros, Xenophon] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Informat & Operat Management, College Stn, TX USA",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hubei University; DePaul University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Jia, XZ (corresponding author), Depaul Univ, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",xjia6@depaul.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71832008, 71902056]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT13030]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71832008, 71902056; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, Grant/Award Number: IRT13030",,108,64,66,84,420,,,,0272-6963,1873-1317,,,,MAR,2021,67,2,,,,,237,260,,10.1002/joom.1118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joom.1118,,SEP 2020,,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many barriers are hindering the promotion of PH, for instance, cost, lack of regulations, and the shortage of knowledge, among which cost is identified as one of the most critical barriers. Unlike previous studies focused only on production costs, this research aims to investigate transaction costs (TCs), e.g., searching costs, negotiation costs, and enforcement costs. First, this paper develops a theoretical TCs framework of the PH supply chain, based on an extensive literature review. Secondly, an empirical study was conducted on two cases in Chongqing to validate the TCs framework. Key stake-holders are identified by Social Network Analysis (SNA). Subsequently, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, both to verify the new TCs framework and to explore stakeholder concerns about TCs. The centrality metrics by SNA identified six key stakeholders who have a significant influence on TCs. It is found from the interviews that both the conceptual phase and the construction phase are stages where the majority of TCs occur. Both the developer and the general contractor are paying for more TCs compared to the other stakeholders. This study contributes to theory by initially introducing the concepts of TCs to the PH field, and the findings bring implications on the governance of PH supply chain to both private stakeholders and the government.

We find publicly traded and larger companies having higher ESG target-setting maturity than privately-owned or smaller companies and that company priorities, costs, and regulatory processes limt ESG progress overall.

These commitments offer much promise for sustainable commodity production, but are undermined by a lack of transparency about their coverage and impacts. Here, using state-of-the-art supply chain data, we introduce an approach to evaluate the impact of ZDCs, linking traders and international markets to commodity-associated deforestation in the sub-national jurisdictions from which they source. We focus on the Brazilian soy sector, where we find that ZDC coverage is increasing, but under-represents the Cerrado biome where most soy-associated deforestation currently takes place. Though soy-associated deforestation declined in the Amazon after the introduction of the Soy Moratorium, we observe no change in the exposure of companies or countries adopting ZDCs to soy-associated deforestation in the Cerrado. We further assess the formulation and implementation of these ZDCs and identify several systematic weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the likelihood that they achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation in future. As the 2020 deadline for several of these commitments approaches, our approach can provide independent monitoring of progress toward the goal of ending commodity-associated deforestation.","[zu Ermgassen, Erasmus K.

Extant research proposes two main forms of mechanisms - collaboration and evaluation - for environmental supply chain management. Despite the wide use of these mechanisms and the empirical insight into the fact that they could be adopted simultaneously, it is unknown if, and, at which levels, environmental collaboration (EC) and environmental evaluation (EE) could be complementary or substitutionary in nature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to gain a clear understanding into the plural forms of these mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The transaction cost economics and relational exchange theory are used to ground the research hypotheses. The results are based on survey data collected from 145 US manufacturing firms. The authors employ polynomial regression as well as the response surface methodology to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings - The results suggest that EC and EE can have an intriguing effect depending on the outcome measure. Specifically, the authors find the effects in the economic and the environmental/social domains to be significantly different. Originality/value - While scholars acknowledge that collaboration and evaluation could act as complements, extant research does not propose and test models that specifically capture complementary and substitutionary nature of these mechanisms. Accordingly, the study makes the first attempt to empirically test for the effects of the simultaneous pursuit of EC and EE.","[Paulraj, Antony] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Blome, Constantin] Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Falmer, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Sussex,"Blome, C (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Falmer, England.",c.blome@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,71,29,29,2,28,,,,0144-3577,1758-6593,,,,,2017,37,8,,,,,1010,1030,,10.1108/IJOPM-11-2015-0722,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-11-2015-0722,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fueled partly by concerns about the risks posed by climate change and other environmental problems, these efforts differ from earlier corporate food supply chain governance in that they rely more on metrics of continuous improvement than compliance with standards. They also extend beyond high-value, high-profile products to include staple ingredients such as corn and soy. These commodities are sourced through long, complex, and traditionally nontransparent supply chains, where even the biggest food companies exercise surprisingly little clout over producers. This article examines how companies contend with this problem both within their own supply chains and as members of multistakeholder initiatives. The assemblage concept not only describes the many actors, technologies, and practices now working to get certain kinds of data flowing off farms; it also highlights the relational nature of this work and the uncertainty of its outcomes. More broadly, the article points to the limits of both corporate food power and the very notion of Big Food as an explanation for how that power is wielded.","[Freidberg, Susanne] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,"Freidberg, S (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Geog, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",freidberg@dartmouth.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1456910]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1456910] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Research for this article was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, Award #1456910.",,118,45,49,0,38,,,,2469-4452,2469-4460,,,,,2017,107,6,,,,,1389,1406,,10.1080/24694452.2017.1309967,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2017.1309967,,,,Geography,,Geography,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The extent to which individual agricultural commodity supply chain interventions can achieve scale, and environmental or social objectives, depends in part on the ways in which those interventions interact with other interventions. We use a case-study of the new Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) cattle certification program in Brazil to explore the different ways in which governance interventions interact. We examine the broad landscape of policies and programs that affect sustainability in the cattle supply chain in Brazil, and assess whether such interventions support or constrain the scaling up of the SAN cattle program. We conducted semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from government, private sector, and civil society organizations. We found that multiple interventions are acting in a complementary manner to enhance sustainability and therefore enable the scaling up of the SAN program, by aiding compliance with environmental laws, adoption of good production practices, and improved monitoring. At the same time, limited development, implementation, and complementarity of some interventions could be antagonistic to the SAN program's expansion because they maintain a context in which many actors operate far below the sustainability criteria required by the program. Our holistic approach enables us to identify specific gaps in the complex landscape of governance interventions in Brazil. Greater strategic complementarity and coordination between interventions may catalyze a more coherent and effective pathway to reduced deforestation and enhanced sustainability.","[Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Inst Internac Sustentabilidade, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Newton, Peter] Univ Michigan, Int Forestry Resources & Inst IFRI Res network, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Newton, Peter] Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Pinto, Guedes] Inst Manejo & Certificacao Florestal Agr & Imaflo, BR-13426420 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Newton, P (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Int Forestry Resources & Inst IFRI Res network, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",peter.newton@colorado.edu,,,Imaflora; European Union (EU),Imaflora; European Union (EU)(European Union (EU)CGIAR),"We would like to thank all of the interviewees for their patience and insight; Melisa Ongun and Ben Chen for assistance with data-collection; and Imaflora for collaboration and support.

This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets' business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers.","[Elder, Sara D.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Elder, SD (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",elder.sara@gmail.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; University of British Columbia; International Development Research Centre; Canadian Association for Studies in Co-operation,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of British Columbia; International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Canadian Association for Studies in Co-operation,"I am grateful to the farmers and organizations that shared their knowledge and experience with me.

Traditionally sustainability in supply chains has focused on environmental dimensions, while a few have attempted to focus on social and economic dimensions without really integrating them. There has been only a small effort to define sustainability by integrating all relevant dimensions (a holistic approach). This paper proposes to fill this gap. We identify sustain ability of a supply chain with the equilibrium of the system over a long (but finite) period of time after integrating the various dimensions. Thus it necessitates looking at factors that can cause a shift in the equilibrium. Towards this, we propose to build a strong theoretical framework to integrate, explain, and predict sustainability for supply chains using cross-disciplinary effort. In our theoretical framework, evolutionary game theory serves as the pure conceptual theory-building tool, the metrics are qualitative in nature and the indicators are quantitative statistical measures. The use of evolutionary game theory concepts allows us to understand how sometimes trivial actions by members of the supply chain can trigger cascading effects that can move the system away from equilibrium. One of the salient aspects of our model is its complete scalability in terms of changes to the dimensions and metrics. As an example, we explain and predict social and economic sustainability (in tandem) for a public health insurance supply chain using evolutionary game theory.

This paper aims to empirically explore the interrelationship between CG, CSR, financial performance (FP) and Corporate Social Performance (CSP) using a sample of 297 electronics companies operating in Taiwan, a newly industrialized Asian economy. The results show that a CG model which includes independent outside directors and which has specific ownership characteristics has a significantly positive impact on both FP and CSP, whereas FP itself does not influence CSP. The presence of independent outside directors in the firm has the greatest impact on the social performance of the firm's worker, customer, supplier, community and society dimensions. Government shareholders enhance a firm's social performance extraordinarily because government shareholders will be more likely to request that companies fulfill their social responsibilities. Only government shareholders positively and significantly relate to a firm's environmental performance. Furthermore, foreign institutional stockholders help to increase worker and supplier performance by paying more attention to employee policies and supply chain relationships. Finally, independent outside directors, foreign institutional stockholders and domestic financial institutional stockholders are shown to improve financial performance.","Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Banking & Cooperat Management, Shinjuang City, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Huang, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Banking & Cooperat Management, Shinjuang City, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,62,112,120,13,273,,,,1833-3672,1839-3527,,,,NOV,2010,16,5,,,,,641,655,,10.5172/jmo.2010.16.5.641,http://dx.doi.org/10.5172/jmo.2010.16.5.641,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Raw rubber production involves various stakeholders; however, literature focusing on the social impacts of the supply chains of raw rubber production has hereto been absent. Social life cycle assessment, a popular tool to assess the social impacts of a product or process and was deployed herein to assess the social profiles of three Sri Lankan raw rubber supply chains (crepe rubber, concentrated latex, and ribbed smoked sheets) in a cradle-to-gate manner. The Social Hotspots Database v4 on Sima Pro v9.3 was used for the analysis. Results indicated that Governance, Labour rights & decent work had been affected due to Corruption and Freedom of association & collective bargaining issues, mainly in Belarus and China. Proposed improvement options to address these touchpoints were found to be effective. If the importation of K-fertilizer shifted into countries with lower risks, such as Canada, Israel, and Lithuania, overall social risks associated with Corruption and Freedom of association & collective bargaining could be reduced by ca. 36% and 25%, respectively. As a result, social risks in the impact described above categories, i.e., Governance and Labor rights & decent work, were reduced by ca. 35-41% and ca. 17-20%, respectively. Managers may pay thorough attention to the hotspots identified herein in the first place and try to avoid them as much as possible.

Transparency will remain a key topic in global value chains and will further develop as it piggy-backs on wider social developments such as globalization, the information age, and the shifting role of states in environmental governance. Transparency in value chains is bound up with positive connotations: the more transparency the better it is for the sustainability of chains and for the empowerment of consumers and civil society. But an overall positive past assessment of value chain transparency does not automatically extend into the future as new challenges lie ahead. This paper investigates the new challenges for value chain transparency and their consequences. Due to the growing importance attached to transparency in value chains it becomes a central object of power struggles, with uncertain outcomes. Markets and states seek to capture transparency arrangements for their own goals, which may not be in line with the assumed normative linkages between value chain transparency and increased power for consumers and civil society. In that sense, transparency is losing its innocence: more transparency is no longer always the best for citizen-consumer empowerment and for the sustainability of value chains. But value chain secrecy is not an attractive alternative. This opens a new research agenda on how transparency should be organized and arranged in value chains to live up to the promises of democracy and sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study conducts case studies focusing on two ENGOs: The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) and Green Hunan. Combining a qualitative approach with quantitative analysis, this research examines two big data-induced initiatives: The first involves green supply chain management in the IPE, brand-sensitive multinational corporations (MNCs), and Chinese suppliers of the MNCs, while the second involves the mobile data-based Riverwatcher Action Network of Green Hunan and numerous volunteers nationwide. This study found that big data adoption by ENGOs contributes effectively to building green social capital, including social networks and pro-environmental social norms. Green social capital has important implications for governance in terms of fostering coordination and cooperation across the boundaries of the public, private, and voluntary sectors.

Here, we use a sample of 25 Indian firms listed for their sustainability performances in the Thomson Reuters Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores. The sustainability performance data have been accessed from the Bloomberg terminal, where the overall sustainability performance on ESG is measured as a discounted score on ESG considering various controversies on ESG reported for the firm. And for the study, we associate financial data using the profit indicators of firms. We perceive that the sustainable supply chain practices considering environmental, social and governance performances may not positively impact the financial performance measured by the Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), during the considered period of five years for the study. We construct the empirical model and use Partial Least Square (PLS) regression modeling to analyze the results. The study can be further extended for many Indian firms and for firms across different developing economies, as well. The major implications of this research are to observe for firms and their supply chains whether the implementation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices can help them in achieving financial benefits, along with other competitive advantages. The research is built on the concept and theory of ecological modernization, which suggests for the economic benefits of environmentalism.","[Sachin, Nikunj; Rajesh, R.] ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management ABV, Management Div, Gwalior, India","ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology & Management, Gwalior","Rajesh, R (corresponding author), ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management ABV, Management Div, Gwalior, India.",sachinnikunj@gmail.com; rajeshambzha@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,64,65,16,140,,,,1387-585X,1573-2975,,,,MAY,2022,24,5,,,,,6577,6601,,10.1007/s10668-021-01717-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01717-1,,AUG 2021,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Developing countries are considered the new fertile territory for developing global chains for multinational enterprises (MNEs). Despite the positive outcomes derived from this global development, it also induces negative impacts in the domain of domestic firms' competition, education, welfare and infrastructure system. A way to overcome this pessimistic view has been found in corporate social responsibility (CSR) best practices. MNEs seek to involve local stakeholders in their social activities to show their commitment and generate innovations. It calls for a multi-tier domestic involvement integrated into a global supply chain to create value. This study builds its empirical analysis exploring a range of 1547 Chinese manufacturing multinational enterprises listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2010 and 2018. The findings revealed that multi-tier supply chain integration (SCI) practices positively moderate the relationship between CSR and MNE performance. In turn, it implies benefits for developing sustainable development goals, generating new job opportunities mostly in the developing countries guaranteeing wealth employment conditions. The sense of involvement and engagement towards their employees requires more development of CSR practices, which can be moderated by multi-tier SCI, as shown in the present study.","[Scuotto, Veronica] Univ Federico II, Dept Econ, Management, Inst, Naples, Italy; [Scuotto, Veronica] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ HSE, Moscow, Russia; [Chin, Tachia] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Pezzi, Alberto] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy; [Pironti, Marco] Univ Turin, ICxT Innovat Interdept Ctr, Turin, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Zhejiang University of Technology; Roma Tre University; University of Turin,"Scuotto, V (corresponding author), Univ Federico II, Dept Econ, Management, Inst, Naples, Italy.",veronica.scuotto@unina.it,,,Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics,Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics,The article is based on the study funded by the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics.,,130,14,14,19,85,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,NOV,2022,29,6,,,SI,,2038,2052,,10.1002/csr.2300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2300,,JUN 2022,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents an investigation of the problem of transshipment among distribution centers (DCs) in a cold supply chain to achieve sustainable inventory cross-filling. Although transshipment is an effective tool for supply chain pooling, the possibility of increased GHG emissions raises environmental concerns. This study establishes a sustainable cold-chain logistics model that considers GHG emissions from DC storage and transshipment trucks. The new sustainable cold-chain model also reflects laden status and cargo weights of trucks for accurate emission assessment. An optimization model is also developed to minimize both GHG emissions and costs in the cold chain. Numerical simulations are conducted for diverse problem cases to examine important problem characteristics. The result analysis identifies that inventory service levels and demand variability have a strong impact on GHG emissions in transshipment; small p-values in the statistical analysis verify the significance of this effect. The different effects of demand variability and service levels on each emission source are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that transshipment among DCs can effectively reduce both GHG emissions and costs in cold supply chains. This study provides useful models and tools to assess GHG emissions and optimize decisions for the design and operation of transshipment. The proposed models will enable the assessment of sustainable alternatives and achieve sustainability objectives effectively for cold supply chains.","[Vu, Hang Thi Thanh; Ko, Jeonghan] Ajou Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 206 Worldcup Ro, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Ajou University,"Ko, JH (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 206 Worldcup Ro, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",jko@ajou.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - government of Korea (MSIT) [NRF-2021R1A2C1095569]; Ajou University research fund; Ajou University Center for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG)","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - government of Korea (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Ajou University research fund; Ajou University Center for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the government of Korea (MSIT) (NRF-2021R1A2C1095569), the Ajou University research fund, and Ajou University Center for Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG).",,69,6,6,6,38,,,,,2071-1050,,,,APR 26,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7211,10.3390/su15097211,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097211,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modern information and communication technologies enable stakeholders to punish buying firms for any sustainability-related grievances at their suppliers, even in remote locations. This study investigates how the notion of country sustainability risk can inform sustainable supply chain management, in particular with respect to sustainability risk assessment at the individual supplier level. Drawing on institutional theory, we provide insights surrounding the emergence of environmental, social, and governance-related country-level sustainability risks and show their implications for and application in sustainable supply chain management. The study employs a design science methodology, based on cooperation with a multidivisional German technology firm, to develop a supply chain sustainability risk (SCSR) map as technological solution design. This article contributes to the study of SCSR by reconciling the scholarly SCSR discourse with the buying firms' pursuit of efficiency. Moreover, it elucidates the augmentation of a research agenda through a design science approach. In practical terms, the technological solution design can directly inform managers about SCSR at the country level and serves as a decision basis for the management of individual suppliers.","[Reinerth, Dagmar; Wagner, Stephan M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Busse, Christian] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Sustainable Prod Management, Oldenburg, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Busse, C (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",christian.busse@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,117,41,42,2,83,,,,0735-3766,2158-1592,,,,SEP,2019,40,3,,,,,241,264,,10.1111/jbl.12190,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbl.12190,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this, buying companies apply different sustainable supply chain management practices. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether buying companies' assessment and cooperation practices enable suppliers to adopt similar practices and thereby further cascade social sustainability requirements to sub-suppliers. While both practices' effects on suppliers' sustainability performance have been investigated, this question has not yet been adequately addressed. To ensure social sustainability along the entire supply chain, we need a deeper understanding of the relationships between the sustainable supply chain management practices of buyers and suppliers. We respond to calls to further investigate the role of inter-organizational learning in the context of sustainability in supply chains. As the supplier perspective remains under-researched in the literature, we conducted a survey among manufacturing sector suppliers in Germany. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between buying companies' assessment and cooperation practices and suppliers' adoption of sustainable supply chain management practices. Our findings reveal that there is a trickle-down effect of sustainable supply chain practices from buying companies to suppliers, and from suppliers to sub -suppliers. Only cooperation practices prove to be effective for the development of suppliers' sustainability ca-pabilities, in contrast to assessment practices. Our findings contribute to the literature on sustainable supply chain management by providing a key building block for understanding the effects of assessment and cooper-ation practices. We are among the first to provide insights on the mechanism of cascading sustainable supply chain management practices in supply chains.","[Allenbacher, Janine; Berg, Nicola] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strateg Management, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Allenbacher, J (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strateg Management, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",janine.allenbacher@uni-hamburg.de; nicola.berg@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,175,14,14,14,83,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JUN 1,2023,403,,,,,,,,136852,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136852,,MAR 2023,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this question, we seek to investigate the effect of institutional pressure on firms' socially SSCM (i.e., assessment and collaboration) and the mediating role of top management support (TMS) for social initiatives. We also argue that organisational culture, which comprises flexibility and control orientation, influences the process from institutional pressures to TMS for social initiatives. Using survey data from 248 buyer-supplier dyads in China, we find that institutional pressure positively influences companies to enhance socially SSCM, including assessment and collaboration practices. Moreover, TMS for social initiatives plays mediating role in the relationship between institutional pressure and socially SSCM. Moreover, flexibility-orientated culture weakens the influence of institutional pressure on TMS for social initiatives, whereas the effect of institutional pressure on TMS for social initiatives intensifies as control-orientated culture increases. This study contributes to the literature by stressing the social dimension of SSCM and linking institutional and organisational factors involved in social ethics issues to understand buying firms' tendency to achieve socially SSCM.","[Zhou, Min] China Univ Geosci, Ctr Energy Environm Management & Decis Making, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Long, Xianyi] Hainan Univ, Int Business Sch, 58 Renming Rd, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Resources, Ctr Sustainable Operat & Resilient Supply Chains C, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Govindan, Kannan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Frontier Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Govindan, Kannan] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Sadasivpet, Telangana, India",China University of Geosciences; Hainan University; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; Shanghai Maritime University; Yonsei University; Woxsen University,"Long, XY (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Int Business Sch, 58 Renming Rd, Haikou 570228, Peoples R China.",longxianyi@hainanu.edu.cn,,,SAFEA High-End Foreign Experts Project,SAFEA High-End Foreign Experts Project,No Statement Availabler No Statement Availabler No Statement Availabler No Statement Availabler No Statement Availabler No Statement Available,,129,9,9,12,69,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,JUL,2024,31,4,,,,,2629,2648,,10.1002/csr.2710,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2710,,JAN 2024,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considerations for Assessment,SUSTAINABILITY,,,,Article,,,,,,local; global; food supply chain; sustainability; assessment; reflexive governance; post-normal science,GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; POLITICS; SYSTEM; HEALTH; DIETS; GREEN,"This paper summarizes the main findings of the GLAMUR project which starts with an apparently simple question: is local more sustainable than global? Sustainability assessment is framed within a post-normal science perspective, advocating the integration of public deliberation and scientific research. The assessment spans 39 local, intermediate and global supply chain case studies across different commodities and countries. Assessment criteria cover environmental, economic, social, health and ethical sustainability dimensions. A closer view of the food system demonstrates a highly dynamic local-global continuum where actors, while adapting to a changing environment, establish multiple relations and animate several chain configurations. The evidence suggests caution when comparing local and global chains, especially when using the outcomes of the comparison in decision-making. Supply chains are analytical constructs that necessarilyand arbitrarilyare confined by system boundaries, isolating a set of elements from an interconnected whole. Even consolidated approaches, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), assess only a part of sustainability attributes, and the interpretation may be controversial. Many sustainability attributes are not yet measurable and hard methodologies need to be complemented by soft methodologies which are at least able to identify critical issues and trade-offs. Aware of these limitations, our research shows that comparing local and global chains, with the necessary caution, can help overcome a priori positions that so far have characterized the debate between localists and globalists. At firm level, comparison between local and global chains could be useful to identify best practices, benchmarks, critical points, and errors to avoid. As sustainability is not a status to achieve, but a never-ending process, comparison and deliberation can be the basis of a reflexive governance of food chains.","[Brunori, Gianluca; Galli, Francesca] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Barjolle, Dominique; Schmitt, Emilia] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETH, Sustainable Agroecosyst Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [van Broekhuizen, Rudolf] Wageningen Univ, Rural Sociol Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Colombo, Luca] Fdn Italiana Ric Agr Biol & Biodinam, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Giampietro, Mario] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Giampietro, Mario; Maye, Damian] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Spain & Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Kirwan, James] Univ Gloucestershire, Countryside & Community Res Inst, Cheltenham GL50 2RH, Glos, England; [Lang, Tim; Smith, Julie] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Mathijs, Erik; Schwarz, Jana] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Bioecon, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [de Roest, Kees] Ctr Ric Prod Anim SpA, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy; [Rougoor, Carin] Ctr Agr & Environm Fdn CLM, NL-4104 BA Culemborg, Netherlands; [Stojanovic, Zaklina] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Tisenkopfs, Talis] Balt Studies Ctr, LV-1014 Riga, Latvia; [Touzard, Jean-Marc] INRA, UMR Innovat, F-34060 Montpellier, France","University of Pisa; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research; ICREA; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Gloucestershire; City St Georges, University of London; City, University of London; KU Leuven; University of Belgrade; INRAE","Galli, F (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",gianluca.brunori@unipi.it; francesca.galli@for.unipi.it; barjolle@ethz.ch; rudolf.vanbroekhuizen@wur.nl; l.colombo@firab.it; mario.giampietro@uab.cat; jkirwan@glos.ac.uk; T.lang@city.ac.uk; erik.mathijs@kuleuven.be; dmaye@glos.ac.uk; k.de.roest@crpa.it; crougoor@clm.nl; jana.schwarz@kuleuven.be; schmitte@ethz.ch; juliesmith.juke@gmail.com; zaklina@ekof.bg.ac.rs; talis.tisenkopfs@lu.lv; touzard@montpellier.inra.fr,,,GLAMUR project as part of the EU [311778]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,GLAMUR project as part of the EU; ICREA(ICREA),This research was funded under the GLAMUR project (Global and Local food chain Assessment: a Multidimensional performance-based approach-http://www.glamur.eu/) as part of the EU 7th Framework Programme (Grant Agreement No.: 311778).

Using this process model as a guide, insights into specific practices and how to implement these relational practices to achieve competitive advantage across organizations are introduced. Design/methodology/approach - Low-carbon cooperation practices framework based on the relational view is developed. A methodology based on DEMATEL and the NK model is used to construct a sequential process model for introducing and implementing these relational practices. Empirical data from three manufacturing organizations in China are utilized to validate the model. Findings - Initial results provide a sequence of relational practices for guiding those organizations and their suppliers for healthy and low-carbon development. Interdependencies between relational practices are analyzed and evaluated from four aspects. Insights into the broader application of the methodology and initial results from both a research and managerial perspective are presented, especially with consideration of the China, an emerging economy, context. Research limitations/implications - The methodology remains relatively abstract in nature, yet the tool can provide very useful interpretations and information for both researchers and practitioners. Practical implications - This paper stipulates that in addition to internal operational practices, the relational practices between buyer and supplier may be equally important to achieve a low-carbon outcome, especially in supply chain setting. This paper also shows that not only the relational practice itself but also the implementation sequence of the relational practices can relate to performance. According to the authors' initial results, organizations in this study should first develop product development cooperation, then exchange carbon knowledge and implement effective governance and last build a trust relationship with its suppliers for low-carbon cooperation. Originality/value - This is one of the few approaches that directly evaluates and identifies the interdependencies among relational practices and to construct a process model for introducing and implementing low-carbon supply chain cooperation. It is also the first time that the NK model has been integrated with DEMATEL. Focusing on Chinese supply chain carbon emissions concerns is also a unique perspective.","[Bai, Chunguang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Sch Business, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Dou, Yijie] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Bai, CG (corresponding author), Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China.",chunguang.bai@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71472031, 71302057]; Liaoning Province Social Science Planning Fund of China [L14DGL046]",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning Province Social Science Planning Fund of China,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (71472031, 71302057); Liaoning Province Social Science Planning Fund of China (L14DGL046).",,101,39,40,4,113,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,,2017,22,3,,,,,237,257,,10.1108/SCM-09-2015-0361,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-09-2015-0361,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 2,106 titles and abstracts were analyzed and 94 papers were fully reviewed, identifying six categories of strategies: inter-firm collaboration and coordination, governance, procurement, projects as networks, production and logistics, and risk management. We present the multi-level Megaproject Supply Chain (MSC) framework, unpacking the complex inter-organizational structure of megaprojects in five levels and units of analysis to guide future research. The MSC framework identifies the micro, meso and macro levels of megaprojects and introduces two additional hybrid levels to identify inter-organizational relationships: the meso-micro and meso-macro. We suggest four avenues to advance supply chain management in megaprojects through multi-level explorations: (i) Supply Chain Structure: Permanent vs Temporary, (ii) Strategic Procurement and Commercial, (iii) Supply Chain Design: Standardization vs Customization, (iv) Supply Chain Governance: Collaboration and Coordination.","[Stefano, Gustavo; Denicol, Juliano; Broyd, Tim] UCL, Fac Built Environm, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London, England; [Davies, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Business Sch, Falmer, England",University of London; University College London; University of Sussex,"Stefano, G (corresponding author), UCL, Fac Built Environm, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London, England.",gustavo.stefano.20@ucl.ac.uk; juliano.denicol@ucl.ac.uk; tim.broyd@ucl.ac.uk; andrew.davies@sussex.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/S009841/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,128,8,8,24,125,,,,0263-7863,1873-4634,,,,APR,2023,41,3,,,,,,,102457,10.1016/j.ijproman.2023.102457,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijproman.2023.102457,,MAY 2023,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because these practices are typically difficult to observe, firms often seek an independent verification and adopt voluntary environmental and social standards and eco-labels such as ISO 14000, FSC, USDA Organic or Fairtrade. The purpose of this paper is to study several factors linked to their adoption. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on existing theory, the authors hypothesize that environmental and social standards will be more widely adopted if they are better-governed, less stringent and more favorably covered in the media. The authors collect data on 41 eco-labels from multiple data sources. Findings - The authors find that the better-governed labels are more widely adopted, but that more stringent labels within the sample are not less widely adopted. More favorable media coverage is not associated with wider adoption. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on the diffusion of a sample of well-established eco-labels. To establish causal links, longitudinal data on governance, stringency, adoption and media coverage would be needed. Practical implications - Managers deciding which eco-label to adopt need not be concerned that a more stringent label will inevitably yield less business value due to the label being less widely adopted. However, they should care whether a label is seen to be well-governed. Managers cannot use the way a label is portrayed in the media as a predictor for adoption. Originality/value - Past research has often ignored how characteristics of environmental and social standards impact their diffusion. The work contributes to the growing literature on diffusion of voluntary standards and eco-labels by adding a quantitative and multi-sectoral perspective.","[Castka, Pavel] Univ Canterbury, Dept Management Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Corbett, Charles] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Canterbury; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Castka, P (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Management Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Christchurch, New Zealand.",pavel.castka@canterbury.ac.nz,,,,,,,68,46,47,8,50,,,,0144-3577,1758-6593,,,,,2016,36,11,,,,,1504,1529,,10.1108/IJOPM-01-2015-0037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-01-2015-0037,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the evident growth pattern, the supply of camel milk to Nairobi has largely remained informal, with minimal enforcement of regulations. The aim of this study was to characterise the camel milk system supplying Nairobi and assess its governance, main challenges and the potential food safety risk practices. A value chain analysis framework was used to carry out data collection between August 2014 and July 2015. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with stakeholders operating in different nodes of the value chains. Three milk value chains supplying Nairobi were identified and mapped: the Isiolo chain, the Kajiado chain and the camel milk processing company chain. Overall, the results indicate that 94% of the milk supplied to Nairobi city is informally traded (traded without any effective regulation), while 6% originates from a formal milk processing company. In the informal chains, milk traders (mostly women) were reported to play a pivotal role in the organisation and daily functioning of the chains. The processing company had partly integrated activities and reported exporting 5% of their products to regional and international markets. Food safety themes identified were associated with i) lack of cold chain, ii) gaps in hygiene practices, particularly at farm and market levels, iii) consumption of raw camel milk, and iv) lack of food safety training, among other issues. Low level involvement by government agencies in enforcing stipulated food safety measures were reported in the informal chains, as these concentrate efforts in the regulation of dairy milk chains. Isiolo milk traders were identified as the dominant group, setting milk prices and providing sanctions. The framework and findings obtained can help future research and policy makers to reach informed decision about what to regulate, where to target and importantly how to make the camel milk value chain more efficient and safer.","[Muloi, Dishon; Ombui, Jackson; Abdullahi, Bulle] Univ Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya; [Muloi, Dishon; Alarcon, Pablo; Muinde, Patrick; Karani, Maurice K.; Fevre, Eric M.] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Muloi, Dishon] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Immun Infect & Evolut, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Alarcon, Pablo; Muinde, Patrick; Karani, Maurice K.] Royal Vet Coll, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Alarcon, Pablo] Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, London, England; [Rushton, Jonathan; Fevre, Eric M.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Ngeiywa, Kisa J.] Kenya Camel Assoc, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Edinburgh; University of London; University of London Royal Veterinary College; University of Liverpool,"Muloi, D; Fèvre, EM (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;Muloi, D; Fèvre, EM (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Int Livestock Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",D.M.Muloi@ed.ac.ulc; Eric.Fevre@liverpool.ac.uk,,,"UK Medical Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK); Economic and Social Research Council (UK); Natural Environment Research Council (UK) through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI) [G1100783/1]; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Department of Veterinary Services within the Kenya Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; BBSRC [BB/L019019/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G1100783] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Medical Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK); Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (UK) through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI); CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)(CGIAR); Department of Veterinary Services within the Kenya Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was supported by the UK Medical Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK), the Economic and Social Research Council (UK), the Natural Environment Research Council (UK), through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI), Grant Reference: G1100783/1.

The conflict has caused product shortages, food scarcity, and significantly impacted the global economy. From the extant literature, there is a lack of understanding about the effect of the conflict on different industries from a supply chain perspective, as well as the ESG-prioritized companies. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the performance of companies with respect to different regions and industries of their upstream and downstream customers. The top-100 companies in the S&P 500 index which are actively participating in the ESG development are selected and grouped according to customer regions and industries, and the event study analysis is applied to evaluate abnormal returns from stock prices due to the disruption events. Through the empirical analysis, no matter how the ESG-prioritized companies are grouped according to their supply chain structures, it is found that the occurrence of companies obtaining the abnormally high stock return is higher than the occurrence of the opposite. Moreover, the active involvement in ESG disclosure and environmental management demonstrates significant results to withstand disruptions to their supply chains. The findings in this study contribute to a growing body of ESG-related business research, implying that companies which prioritize ESG policies may be better equipped to manage supply chain disruptions during crises.","[Li, Yanlin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hunghom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fan, Youqing] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, Australia",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Western Sydney University,"Fan, YQ (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, Australia.",yungpo.tsang@polyu.edu.hk; Y.Fan@westernsydney.edu.au; zhanpeng.feng@connect.polyu.hk; li@connect.polyu.hk,,,,,,,44,17,17,38,130,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 1,2024,434,,,,,,,,139754,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139754,,NOV 2023,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These challenges have imposed immense pressures on SCs, amplifying both the risks and occurrences of disruptions. In response to these critical demands, there has been a substantial increase in academic, industrial, and governmental focus on the resilience and recovery capabilities of SCs. In this context, the supply chain (SC) for sewage treatment equipment has been significantly affected. This study aims to systematically investigate collaborative strategies and mechanisms for bolstering the resilience of manufacturing SCs within the sewage treatment sector, with particular attention to collaborative decision-making, information sharing, and risk mitigation throughout the SC lifecycle. Following a comparative analysis of various methodologies, this paper employed the structural equation model (SEM) and subsequently conducted a comprehensive survey of manufacturers specializing in glass fiber sewage treatment systems, yielding 385 valid responses. Through this data, a structural equation model was developed to analyze pathways for resilience enhancement. A thorough analysis of the results indicates that Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC) and collaborative decision-making are instrumental in strengthening Glass Fiber Sewage Treatment Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) through the implementation of effective information sharing and risk management practices. These findings contribute to the theoretical framework of SCC and SCR by clarifying the influence of collaborative practices while also providing practical guidance for the governance and strategic management of sewage treatment equipment enterprises and their associated SCs. The conclusions drawn from this study can guide us in establishing a more resilient and sustainable SC ecosystem, making it more directive and capable of mitigating complex disruptions.","[Xu, Xu; Wang, Jie; He, Chan; Jiang, Xuting; An, Qianru] Shanghai Dianji Univ, Business Sch, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China",Shanghai Dianji University,"Xu, X (corresponding author), Shanghai Dianji Univ, Business Sch, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China.",xux@sdju.edu.cn; 23600004120214@st.sdju.edu.cn; 23600004120113@st.sdju.edu.cn; 23600004120101@st.sdju.edu.cn,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Planning fund project, Ministry of Education [20YJA880064, 20YJCZH027]; Humanities and Social Sciences Planning fund project, Ministry of Education, China","Humanities and Social Sciences Planning fund project, Ministry of Education; Humanities and Social Sciences Planning fund project, Ministry of Education, China","This work was supported in part by the Humanities and Social Sciences Planning fund project, Ministry of Education, China, grant numbers 20YJA880064 and 20YJCZH027.

Hypotheses are developed that collaborative sustainability projects achieve the greatest levels of ESG performance, followed by in-house projects, and then outsourced projects. Furthermore, moderating hypotheses hold that these relationships are affected by two country-level variables: country stakeholder orientation and country risk. Using hierarchical linear modeling and regression analysis, with data from the Sustainalytics and Bloomberg ESG databases for 459 firms in nine countries, support was found for the comparative impacts of sustainability governance on ESG performance. Namely, collaborative governance produced the greatest ESG performance benefits, followed by in-house and outsourced as hypothesized. Country stakeholder orientation generally increases these effects; however, the country risk hypotheses are not supported. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that all forms of sustainability governance can improve ESG performance; however, the degree to which each one contributes to ESG performance varies. In addition, institutional context clearly matters, because countries where a high stakeholder orientation exists appear to facilitate the implementation of in-house, outsourced and collaborative sustainability initiatives.

The model selects suppliers and determines sustainability investments and order allocations among the selected suppliers. High sustainability performance, as well as cost efficiency, is achieved while a high operational performance level is maintained. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear bi-objective integer-programming model, discover the model's special features, and propose an effective and computationally efficient algorithm to solve it. To quantify a supply chain's sustainability performance, we adopt the Environmental, Social, and Governance index. Instead of searching for just one sourcing solution, we find the Pareto-optimal set of effective solutions. Numerical tests verify that our algorithm outperforms an existing sourcing algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. A simulation of Apple's sourcing decisions demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in business practice. Our work also provides managerial insights on how sustainable operations alter traditional supply chain sourcing decisions. It helps practitioners make fast and effective sourcing and investment decisions to implement their sustainability strategies at the operational level.","[Li, Gang] Bentley Univ, Dept Management, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Xia, Yu] Coll William & Mary, Raymond A Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",Bentley University; William & Mary,"Xia, Y (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Raymond A Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",amy.xia@mason.wm.edu,,,,,,,72,4,4,3,19,,,,2472-5854,2472-5862,,,,AUG 3,2023,55,8,,,,,794,806,,10.1080/24725854.2022.2111481,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2022.2111481,,AUG 2022,,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While there is now an embryonic literature on this subject, we lack systematic, integrated analytical frameworks that can improve our understanding of the role that governance of clusters play in addressing CSR concerns in SMEs in developing countries. This article develops such a conceptual framework drawing on the literatures on cluster governance, CSR, SMEs, and environmental management (EM) as they relate to the developing countries. The authors argue that environmental improvements in SME clusters can be achieved through three basic types of cluster governance: legal enforcement, supply chain pressure, and voluntary engagement in CSR. The proposed framework is an attempt to show how each type of cluster governance is likely to induce different responses in cluster-based SMEs. These responses are related to stages of CSR in which SMEs engage, the barriers to EM they face, the types of EM practices they use, the climate change strategy types they use, and the kinds of benefits that accrue to SMEs from engagement in CSR. The authors put foward a framework that can be useful for both academics and practitioners as they seek to reflect on the interconnectedness of these themes from a research, policy, and practice perspective.","[de Oliveira, Jose A.

Based on this, this paper uses the research method of Stackelberg game theory to propose the green supply chain model with a dual-channel structure, in which consumer green preference and channel preference are considered. In addition, two cases of government subsidies and no government subsidies are also considered. The paper is aimed to explore products collaborative pricing policies in dual-channel green supply chain, and compare the optimal solutions in two cases. Findings illustrate that government subsidies will reduce green products? price, and effectively promote the sales of green products; government subsidies are beneficial to the manufacturer, and the impact on retailer?s profit depends on the amount of government subsidies; the higher the consumer?s green preference or the lower the offline channel preference, the greater the demand for green products. The research findings can provide useful insights for members of the dual-channel green supply chain to make optimal decisions with and without government subsidies, thereby enhancing the market competitiveness of green products.

Drawing upon congruence theory, this paper explores the impact of ESG performance congruence among different supply chain members on both firm financial constraints and market value. This study employs response surface analysis and cluster analysis to examine the data of Chinese listed firms and their supply chains from 2009 to 2022. From the dyadic perspective of customer-supplier, the results suggest that the congruence of customer and supplier ESG performance reduces customers' financial constraints while increasing suppliers' financial constraints. The reduction in customers' financial constraints enhances customers' firm value. This study further reveals different configuration patterns of ESG performance within the supply chain from the triadic perspective of customer-focal firm-supplier. Our findings enrich the empirical research on ESG performance within supply chains, offering significant insights for managers and investors in allocating supply chain resources and formulating ESG investment strategies.","[Xu, Jiawei; Lu, Jianjun; Chai, Li; Zhang, Baofeng; Qiao, Dakuan; Li, Shuai] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Lu, JJ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ljjun@cau.edu.cn,,,Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71901010]; [24YJC630282],"Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));","This work was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (24YJC630282) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 71901010).

In this paper, I argue that private, value chain-oriented forms of sustainability governance are not addressing the environmental problems they are putatively designed to solve. Through the analysis of how lead firms stimulate environmental upgrading along their value chains, I show that the mainstreaming of sustainability in business operations has allowed global buyers to accumulate 'green' profits and capital in ways that extract value from suppliers - especially those based in the global South. Drawing from analyses of the wine and coffee value chains, I show how lead firms push the hidden costs of sustainability compliance and related risks upstream towards producers. These processes have important redistributive repercussions as they raise entry barriers for smaller, less organized and/or more marginalized actors. Under the mantle of achieving environmental sustainability, lead firms in value chains stealthily capture value for themselves, while extracting more demands from their suppliers and promoting a further consolidation of their supply base. In the meanwhile, serious environmental challenges remain unaddressed.","[Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Ponte, Stefano] Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Competit Regulat & Econ Dev, Johannesburg, South Africa",Copenhagen Business School; University of Johannesburg,"Ponte, S (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Ponte, S (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Competit Regulat & Econ Dev, Johannesburg, South Africa.",spo.msc@cbs.dk,,,,,,,132,49,49,5,103,,,,0969-2290,1466-4526,,,,MAY 4,2022,29,3,,,SI,,818,843,,10.1080/09692290.2020.1816199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1816199,,SEP 2020,,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Supply chain stickiness, understood as the stability in trading relationships between supply chain actors, moderates the impacts of agricultural commodity production and the possibilities for supply-chain in-terventions. However, what factors determine stickiness, that is, how and why farmers, traders, food processors, and consumer countries, develop and maintain trading relationships with specific producing regions, remains unclear. Here, we use data on the Brazilian soy supply chain, a mixed methods approach based on extensive actor-based fieldwork, and an explanatory regression model, to identify and explore the factors that influence stickiness between places of production and supply chain actors. We find four groups of factors to be important: economic incentives, institutional enablers and constraints, social and power dimensions, and biophysical and technological conditions. Among the factors we explore, surplus capacity in soy processing infrastructure, (i.e., crushing and storage facilities) is important in increasing stickiness, as is export-oriented production. Conversely, volatility in market demand expressed by farm-gate soy prices and lower land-tenure security are key factors reducing stickiness. Importantly, we uncover heterogeneity and context-specificity in the factors determining stickiness, suggesting tailored supply-chain interventions are beneficial. Understanding supply chain stickiness does not, in itself, provide silver-bullet solutions to stopping deforestation, but it is a crucial prerequisite to understanding the relationships between supply chain actors and producing regions, identifying entry points for supply chain sustainability interventions, assessing the effectiveness of such interventions, forecasting the restructuring of trade flows, and considering sourcing patterns of supply chain actors in territorial planning.","[dos Reis, Tiago N.

In response, private and public actors in the extractive sector have signaled that they are retooling mineral production, sourcing and stewardship governance systems, practices, and processes to meet the sustainability demands of the electric vehicle (EV) transition. Currently, however, the specific components of many of these initiatives remain less well known, with little scholarly review of their potential to address the longstanding systemic deficiencies in mineral supply chains. Instead, research and policy conversations are oriented largely towards what can be described as a demand-reduction approach, focused on minimizing the intensity of metal mining as a strategy for ensuring the sustainability imperatives of the transition. This Perspective argues that 1) the EV transition offers a critical impetus for tackling head-on longstanding systemic deficiencies in responsible global mineral production, sourcing, and stewardship 2) addressing the deficiencies will also better position mineral demand-reduction measures to yield their intended sustainability outcomes and 3) historically, new initiatives introduced to reform the extractive sector rarely address the root problems that first gave impetus to the initiatives. Accordingly, questions about retooling existing mineral procurement governance systems, practices and processes should be an integral part of EV transition research. It recommends moving research, policy, action, and investment towards prioritizing addressing persisting systemic deficiencies in global mineral supply chains as part of strategies for ensuring ethical transport decarbonization.","[Boateng, Festival Godwin] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm SOGE, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England; [Boateng, Festival Godwin; Klopp, Jacqueline M.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CSUD, Columbia Climate Sch, New York, NY USA",University of Oxford; Columbia University,"Boateng, FG (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm SOGE, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England.",festival.boateng@ouce.ox.ac.uk; jk2002@columbia.edu,,,,,,,60,5,5,6,12,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,JUL,2024,113,,,,,,,,103541,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103541,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2024.103541,,APR 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, it establishes a green management standard with GSCM that companies can adopt. The environmental, economic, and social components determine the concept of GSCM. However, the development and commercialization of renewable energy and sustainable manufacturing practices play a fundamental role in shaping the traditional supply chain management (SCM) and business models. GSCM means that firms and organizations must balance economic and environmental performance to stay competitive, and conform with regulatory and community pressures. This has forced enterprises to design and implement strategies such as eco-efficiency, greener production, and cleaner environmental practices, for green management practices, which aim at reducing the environmental impacts of their operations. This study further highlights insights needed to significantly improve performance and overcome barriers to the development of renewable energy green supply chain management (REGSCM). It also presents useful techniques by outlining better control chain costs to make renewable energy more affordable and efficient, and a new conceptual model that is mainly grounded within the network of distributed energy systems in the context of GSCM. This concept allows renewable energy producers to sell their surplus electricity based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network or sell directly via the general market.

With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)-certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies-most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.","[Garrett, Rachael D.; Levy, Samuel A.; Hodel, Leonie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Environm Syst Sci & Humanities, Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrett, Rachael D.; Levy, Samuel A.; Hodel, Leonie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Polit, Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrett, Rachael D.; Levy, Samuel A.; Hodel, Leonie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gollnow, Florian] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD USA; [Gollnow, Florian] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA USA; [Rueda, Ximena] Univ Andes, Sch Management, Bogota, Colombia",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Boston University; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Garrett, RD (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Environm Syst Sci & Humanities, Zurich, Switzerland.;Garrett, RD (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Polit, Zurich, Switzerland.;Garrett, RD (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Dept Social Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",rgarrett@ethz.ch,,,"Meridian Institute Supply Chain Sustainability Research Fund; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875]; National Science Foundation [1739253]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1739253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Meridian Institute Supply Chain Sustainability Research Fund; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Jeffrey Milder for his feedback at multiple stages of this research, including providing suggestions to the methodology and comments on several drafts.

Over the last decade, audits have evolved from a tool for companies to track internal organisational performance into a transnational governing mechanism to measure and strengthen corporate accountability globally and shape corporate responsibility norms. Drawing on original interviews, we assess the effectiveness of supply chain benchmarks and audits in promoting environmental and social improvements in global retail supply chains. Two principal arguments emerge from our analysis. First, that audits can be best understood as a productive form of power, which codifies and legitimates retail corporations' poor social and environmental records, and shapes state approaches to supply chain governance. Second, that growing public and government trust in audit metrics ends up concealing real problems in global supply chains. Retailers are, in fact, auditing only small portions of supply chains, omitting the portions of supply chains where labour and environmental abuse are most likely to take place. Furthermore, the audit regime tends to address labour and environmental issues very unevenly, since people' are more difficult to classify and verify through numbers than capital and product quality.","[Lebaron, Genevieve] Univ Sheffield, Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Lister, Jane] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of Sheffield; University of British Columbia,"Lebaron, G (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Polit, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; ESRC [ES/M003051/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for research funding and to Peter Dauvergne for many inspiring conversations.

Despite universal pressure on retailers to disclose information on supply chain practices, uptake of transparency policies and practices has been heterogenous amongst large fast fashion companies. In this paper, we explain variation in transparency practices through a comparison of the four largest fast fashion retailers: H&M, Inditex, Gap, and Fast Retailing. Drawing on cross-case comparison and within-case process tracing, we offer insights into why some retailers are more transparent than others. Our findings suggest that sustainability scandals are a necessary but insufficient condition for motivating firms to increase transparency in their supply chains. Scandals can be an important driver of increased transparency, but only when accompanied by support from senior management and alignment with domestic norms about appropriate corporate conduct. These findings contribute to the literature on transnational business governance, corporate transparency, and sustainable supply-chain management.","[Fraser, Eve] Univ Oxford, Nat Soc & Environm Governance Program, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [van der Ven, Hamish] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Wood Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of Oxford; University of British Columbia,"van der Ven, H (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Wood Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",hamish.vanderven@ubc.ca,,,University of British Columbia,University of British Columbia,This research received no external funding.

This study aims to delve into how digital transformation may impact a company's ESG performance from the perspective of supply chain resilience. We collect non-financial listed companies in China's A-shares from 2009 to 2022 as research samples. The results show that digital transformation can significantly improve the ESG performance. Digital transformation can enhance supply chain resilience, namely by reducing supplier and customer concentration to improve a company's ESG performance. We also reveal that non-heavy polluting companies, high-tech companies, and companies in the eastern regions are more sensitive to digital transformation in terms of ESG performance. This paper contributes to examining the relationship between digital transformation and corporate ESG performance, providing both a theoretical foundation and practical recommendations for guiding companies in achieving digital transformation and improving their ESG performance.","[Zhang, Meixuan; Huang, Zongsheng] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University,"Huang, ZS (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",zhangmx0810@163.com; zshuang@shmtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,50,4,4,136,164,,,,,2071-1050,,,,SEP,2024,16,17,,,,,,,7621,10.3390/su16177621,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16177621,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The multidisciplinary approach draws on both interviews with key actors and chemical analysis of PFAS in food packaging. It shows how demands for accountability for chemicals are translated both horizontally in the industry and vertically in supply chains resulting in a set of interrelated voluntary standards and rules. The chemical analysis detected PFAS in almost half of the samples, but at levels indicating non-intentional use, thereby complying with the disseminated rules. The result shows that the standards largely institutionalize established practices in support of laggards rather than push the industry to more radical phase-out of PFAS.","[Dahlstrom, Sabina Du Rietz] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ind Econ & Management, Lindstedtsvagen 30, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dahlstrom, Sabina Du Rietz] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, Orebro, Sweden; [Hysing, Erik] Orebro Univ, Sch Humanities Educ & Social Sci, Orebro, Sweden; [Eriksson, Ulrika; Ericson Jogsten, Ingrid] Orebro Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Orebro, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Orebro University; Orebro University; Orebro University,"Dahlström, SD (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ind Econ & Management, Lindstedtsvagen 30, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",sabina.durietz@indek.kth.se,,,Swedish research council Formas - a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development [2021-00460]; Formas [2021-00460] Funding Source: Formas,Swedish research council Formas - a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is funded by the Swedish research council Formas - a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development, grant number 2021-00460.",,46,0,0,0,0,,,,0007-6503,1552-4205,,,,2025 MAR 19,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/00076503251325713,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00076503251325713,,MAR 2025,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

One way in which such challenges might be addressed is through an increased focus on the effects of business processes such as those within supply chain relations. This paper seeks to understand the role and significance of supply chain leverage in promoting health and safety management at sea, the institutional contexts in which such leverage occurs and under which circumstances it is effective. It draws on findings from a research project examining the views of seafarers and their managers on what drives the implementation of occupational health and safety (OHS) management arrangements in two shipping sectors. Essentially, these findings show that under certain conditions, supply chain relations are useful in helping to support the implementation of arrangements for OHS management on merchant vessels. However, such leverage is most likely to be effective when it operates within a wider institutional framework in which public regulation and its surveillance by regulatory authorities remain a key element.","[Walters, David] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Work Environm, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Walters, David] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, CWERC, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [James, Philip] Middlesex Univ, Employment Relat, London N17 8HR, England; [Sampson, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Bhattacharya, Syamantak] Univ Plymouth, Grad Sch Management, Int Shipping & Port Management, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Xue, Conghua] Nantong Shipping Coll, Management Engn, Nantong, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wadsworth, Emma] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; Middlesex University; Cardiff University; University of Plymouth; Jiangsu Shipping College; Cardiff University,"Walters, D (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Work Environm, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.;Walters, D (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, CWERC, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.;James, P (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Employment Relat, London N17 8HR, England.;Sampson, H (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.;Bhattacharya, S (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Grad Sch Management, Int Shipping & Port Management, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.;Xue, CH (corresponding author), Nantong Shipping Coll, Management Engn, Nantong, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wadsworth, E (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales.",waltersd@cardiff.ac.uk; p.w.james@mdx.ac.uk; sampsonh@cf.ac.uk; S.Bhattacharya@plymouth.ac.uk; Conghua_xue@hotmail.com; wadsworthej@cardiff.ac.uk,,,Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH),Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH),"This research was funded by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH).

We find that multiple possible combinations of the maturity of companies' ESG practices and CAE's perception of the IAF stakeholders' salience drive the type of IAF's involvement in ESG. In ESG-mature companies with more salient ACs, the IAF provides assurance over ESG practices, ESG reporting, and reputation risks related to ESG, and it focuses on the governance dimension of ESG. When the CEO is perceived as more salient, the type of IAF's involvement includes both assurance over ESG controls in the supply chain and consulting on ESG activities. In contrast, in low ESG maturity companies with more salient AC, the IAF's role is limited to providing assurance over internal controls established to comply with environmental, health, and safety legal requirements, and prevent managers' unethical behavior. Finally, we discuss the implications for the IAF's ability to add value to the organization.

These countries have started to adopt green supply chain management (GSCM) as a strategy to reduce the environmental impact. There are anecdotal evidences that the adoption of GSCM in this region is partly influenced by Guanxi - a cultural norm, which plays a significant role in relationship governance within supply chain activities among the AEE. Based on a systematic literature review, we develop a conceptual framework that characterizes the drivers and barriers for the adoption of GSCM practices, incorporating Guanxi as a moderator in the manufacturing sector of the AEE. The conceptual framework addresses the roles of two types of Guanxi in the adoption of GSCM: the relational Guanxi at individual level based on social exchange theory and the aggregated Guanxi at firm level derived from social capital theory. This recognition of Guanxi at two separate decision levels help companies better manage their relationships while they green their supply chains.

Qualitative data were collected in seven focus group discussions and 10 key informants' interviews on animal movements and product flows, stakeholders' interactions, perceptions on system governance and challenges, and on their potential impact on food safety management. Quantitative data were obtained to show the importance of flows, business operations and market share. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes that provide understanding on the governance, challenges and food safety practices in each profile. The predominant chains identified were [1] The large integrated company profile which accounted for 83.6% of pork marketed through abattoirs, and was based on a well-structured supply system, with owned farms (representing 50% of their supply), contract farms and semi-contract farms and [2] Local independent abattoirs, accounting for 16.4%, are privately owned small-scale production, supplied mainly (70%) by small farmers from the immediate neighboring areas. The main challenges associated with governance themes included; (i) Inadequate/lack of enforcement of existing regulation (ii) Negative effect of devolution system of governance (iii) Pig traders' dominance (iii) Lack of association at all system nodes, and (iv) Male dominance across the pig system. The main challenges reported included; (i) Lack of capital to upscale (ii) Poor infrastructure (iii) Pig shortage (iv) Excessive regulation (v) Lack of training (vi) Diseases (v) Lack of knowledge (vi) Unfair competition. Food safety themes were associated with (i) Inadequate slaughter facilities forcing traders/farmers to undertake home slaughter (ii) Lack of knowledge on disease management (iii) Lack of training on hygienic practices in the slaughterhouse and (iv) Lack/insufficient capital to purchase equipment's to ensure proper hygiene e.g., boilers. The study provides insights into the structure of the pork system supplying Nairobi, the governance issues important to the stakeholders, challenges and food safety issues.

In response to the current situation, the current research takes less account of the subjective perception of public panic buying and the lack of reference to the reality of effective governance. First, this paper uses prospect theory to portray the public's perceived value of goods in panic buying and non-panic buying situations. Then, drawing on the experience of effective governance in China, a tripartite evolutionary game model of local government, the public and green smart supply chain enterprises is constructed under the reward and punishment mechanism of the central government. Then, this paper analyzes the strategic choices of each game player and the stability of the system equilibrium. The structure of the study suggests the following. (1) Improving local government subsidies and penalties, the cost of positive response and the probability of response can lead to an evolutionary direction where the public chooses not to panic buy and green smart supply chain enterprises choose to ensure a balance between supply and demand and increase pollution control in the production process. (2) Our study yields three effective combinations of evolutionary strategies, of which an ideal combination of evolutionary strategies exists. Non-ideal evolutionary strategy combinations can occur due to improper incentives and penalties of local governments and misallocation of limited resources. However, we find four paths that can transform the non-ideal evolutionary strategy combination into an ideal evolutionary strategy combination. (3) The central government's reward and punishment mechanism is an important tool to stabilize the tripartite strategy, but the central government cannot achieve effective governance by replacing incentives with punishment.","[Xu, Ruzhi; Yan, Chenglong; Wang, Chenlong; Zhao, Huawei] Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China",Qilu University of Technology,"Yan, CL (corresponding author), Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China.",xrz@qlu.edu.cn; clyanedu@163.com,,,Technology-based SMEs' Innovation Ability Improvement Projects in Shandong Province [2022TSGC2042]; Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project in Shandong Province [2018CXGC0703],Technology-based SMEs' Innovation Ability Improvement Projects in Shandong Province; Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Project in Shandong Province,"This research was funded by Technology-based SMEs' Innovation Ability Improvement Projects in Shandong Province, grant numbers No.2022TSGC2148, Technology-based SMEs' Innovation Ability Improvement Projects in Shandong Province, grant numbers No.2022TSGC2042, and Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects in Shandong Province, grant numbers No. 2018CXGC0703.",,46,3,3,2,35,,,,,2071-1050,,,,APR 26,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7229,10.3390/su15097229,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097229,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have not examined whether the digital transformation of businesses contributes to green technology innovation among upstream and downstream enterprises from a supply chain perspective. To fill this gap, this study constructs a supplier - customer - year supply chain relationship sample using data on Chinese listed companies from 2009 to 2020, and applies a two-way fixed-effects model to examine the impact of downstream customers' digital transformation on upstream suppliers' green technology innovation. Findings show that customer-driven digital transformation significantly increases suppliers' green technological innovation, through the action channels of the forcing effect of green transformation, cohort effect of digital transformation, and spillover effect of green technological innovation. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect of customer digital transformation on suppliers' green technological innovation differs significantly based on different supplier and customer characteristics. Further analysis indicates that the synergy between digitalization and greening created by customer digital transformation can also play a crucial role in enhancing suppliers' environmental and social governance performance. The findings have significant policy implications for the synergistic development of digitalization and greening of the entire supply chain, with the opportunity to foster sustainable socioeconomic development.","[Bian, Zhiqiang] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Luo, Mi] Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Stat, Yantai, Peoples R China",Shandong Technology & Business University; Shandong Technology & Business University,"Bian, ZQ (corresponding author), Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Yantai, Peoples R China.",bianzhiqiang@sdtbu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72004122, 72073021]; Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan Strategic Research Project [2023ZLYJ107]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan Strategic Research Project,"This research received support from National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 72004122], National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 72073021], Yantai Science and Technology Innovation Development Plan Strategic Research Project [No. 2023ZLYJ107].",,52,0,0,1,1,,,,0003-6846,1466-4283,,,,2025 MAR 30,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00036846.2025.2482236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2025.2482236,,MAR 2025,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are central actors in these chains, bearing responsibilities towards workers and the environment. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards guide MNEs in assessing the societal and environmental impacts of their activities, though these standards remain largely voluntary. Recent investment treaty practice shows a trend to incorporate CSR provisions in international investment agreements (IIAs), but such clauses fail to impose direct human rights, labour and environmental obligations on investors. Amidst this landscape, the EU and China, major players in global trade and investment, have established diverging legal and policy frameworks to build responsible and sustainable supply chains. Considering these developments, the objectives of this article are twofold. First, the article explores the integration of CSR in international investment law. Second, it evaluates the different CSR initiatives taken by the EU and China that frame their foreign direct investments. Focusing on EU-China FDI relations, the article delineates implications for global supply chain governance offering insights into the evolving landscape of CSR frameworks, and the plagued path in adopting mandatory corporate responsibility standards.","[Schacherer, Stefanie] Singapore Management Univ, Yong Pung Sch Law, Singapore City, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Schacherer, S (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Yong Pung Sch Law, Singapore City, Singapore.",sschacherer@smu.edu.sg,,,Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy's BRI Program; Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy's BRI Program,Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy's BRI Program; Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy's BRI Program,"The author acknowledges and is grateful for the support of the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy's BRI Program.

At the center of critical supply chains is the food-energy-water nexus (FEW); a nexus that is key to a community's wellbeing, resilience, and sustainability. In the 21st century, managing a local FEW nexus requires accurate data describing the function and structure of a community's supply chains. However, data is not enough; we need data-informed conversation and technical and social capacity building among local stakeholders to utilize the data effectively. There are some resources available at the mesoscale and for food, energy, or water, but many communities lack the data and tools needed to understand connections and bridge the gaps between these scales and systems. As a result, we currently lack the capacity to manage these systems in small and medium sized communities where the vast majority of people, decisions, and problems reside. This study develops and validates a participatory citizen science process for FEW nexus capacity building and data-driven problem solving in small communities at the grassroots level. The FEWSION for Community Resilience (F4R) process applies a Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) framework to map supply chain data for a community's FEW nexus, to identify the social network that manages the nexus, and then to generate a data-informed conversation among stakeholders. F4R was piloted and co-developed with participants over a 2-year study, using a design-based research process to make evidence-based adjustments as needed. Results show that the F4R model was successful at improving volunteers' awareness about nexus and supply chain issues, at creating a network of connections and communication with stakeholders across state, regional, and local organizations, and in facilitating data-informed discussion about improvements to the system. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of F4R and discuss four recommendations for the successful application of the F4R model in other communities: 1) embed opportunities for co-created PPSR, 2) build social capital, 3) integrate active learning strategies with user-friendly digital tools, and 4) adopt existing materials and structure.","[Ryan, Sean M.; Bloom, Nena] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Sci Teaching & Learning, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Roberts, Elisabeth] STEM & Leaf LLC, Tucson, AZ USA; [Hibbett, Emma] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Haden, Carol] Magnolia Consulting LLC, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Rushforth, Richard R.; Ruddell, Benjamin L.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Pfeiffer, Kyle] Argonne Natl Lab, Natl Preparedness Analyt Ctr, Lemont, IL USA",Northern Arizona University; Imperial College London; Northern Arizona University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Ruddell, BL (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Benjamin.ruddell@nau.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [ACI-1639529],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"FEWSION and FEWSION for Community Resilience (F4R) were founded in 2016 by a grant and supplement from the INFEWS program that is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), ACI-1639529.

Using data from 206 Chinese manufacturers, we can show that both contractual control and relational norms facilitate green customer integration. Interestingly, the promotional effects of contractual control and relational norms are undermined if manufacturers exert mediated power. Furthermore, the weakened effect of mediated power on the relationship between contractual control and green customer integration is strengthened by demand uncertainty. Conversely, the strengthened impact of non-mediated power on the relational norms?green customer integration relationship is strengthened by demand uncertainty as well as technological uncertainty. This study extends current green supply chain research by revealing that governance mechanisms are antecedent to green customer integration in emerging markets, from the perspective of interfirm relationship management.

Organizations can strengthen their supply chain networks through strategic changes in structure and processes. In this connection, this study explores the extant literature on supply chain resilience (SCRE) concerning soft organizational factors (leadership, organizational culture and knowledge management) to analyse recent trends in this domain and propose future research directions.Design/methodology/approachIt is a bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review of research articles from 2004 to 2024, collected from ISI Web of Science with keywords searches such as knowledge management and supply chain resilience, leadership and supply chain resilience and organizational culture and supply chain resilience. VOS viewer and ATLAS.ti were utilized for the co-occurrence and co-authorship analysis of the articles along with focusing on aspects such as theoretical and practical implications, the collaboration institutions and the countries involved in relation to the topic of interest.FindingsThe review shows that the development of studies on SCRE was slow from 2004 to 2015 but grew significantly from 2015 onwards and rose exponentially after 2020. Most studies were published in 2023. Results reveal the development of proactive strategies for SCRE in the recent literature by focusing on organizational factors. The study highlights exploring the contextual interplay between environmental, social and governance (ESG) and soft organizational factors for mitigation of supply chain risk and resilience in large-scale projects.Originality/valueThe COVID-19 pandemic became the precursor to highlighting the antecedents of SCRE, but the study of soft organizational drivers is still an ongoing area of research.

However, the mechanism of how BCT affects GSCI is still blurred. Based on transaction cost theory and resource dependence theory, this research explores the mediating effect of supply chain trust in the relationship between BCT adoption and GSCI and the moderating role of organizational culture. We examine hypotheses using two waves of survey data from 317 Chinese manufacturers. The results reveal that BCT has a positive effect on supply chain trust, and supply chain trust partially mediates the impacts of BCT on three dimensions of GSCI. Moreover, a flexible-oriented culture alleviates the impact of BCT on supply chain trust, whereas a control-oriented culture strengthens the relationship. This research unfolds the black box in the BCT-GSCI relationship by exploring the mediating role of supply chain trust, and it is seldom a study that simultaneously combines information management area (BCT), operation management area (GSCI), and organizational behavior area (organizational culture) in a framework.","[Long, Yunguang] Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, Xian, Peoples R China; [Feng, Taiwen] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, Weihai, Peoples R China; [Fan, Youqing] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Business, Sydney, Australia; [Liu, Lijun] Hebei GEO Univ, Sch Econ, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lijun] Hebei GEO Univ, Hebei Prov Mineral Resources Dev & Management & Re, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Posts & Telecommunications; Harbin Institute of Technology; Western Sydney University; Hebei GEO University; Hebei GEO University,"Liu, LJ (corresponding author), Hebei GEO Univ, Hebei Prov Mineral Resources Dev & Management & Re, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R China.",18632107207@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province; Science and Technology Program for Innovation of Shandong Universities; [72172040]; [19YJC630110]; [2018S23]; [tsqn201909154]; [2020RWG003],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province; Science and Technology Program for Innovation of Shandong Universities; ; ; ; ;","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72172040), Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (19YJC630110), Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2018S23), Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province (tsqn201909154), and Science and Technology Program for Innovation of Shandong Universities (2020RWG003).",,126,39,39,26,211,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,SEP,2023,32,6,,,,,3326,3343,,10.1002/bse.3302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3302,,NOV 2022,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It evaluates the understanding of AMR (and drug-resistant infections) as a food system challenge and critically explores how responsibility for addressing it is framed and implemented. We place the spotlight on the AMR strategies applied in UK retailers' domestic poultry and pork supply chains. This provides a timely analysis of corporate engagement with AMR in light of the 2016 O'Neill report on Tackling Drug Resistant Infections Globally, which positioned supermarket chains, processors, and regulators as holding key responsibilities. Research included interviews with retailers, industry bodies, policy makers, farmers, processors, consultants and campaigners. We evaluate how strategy for tackling AMR in the food system is focused on antimicrobial stewardship, particularly targets for reducing antibiotic use in domestic food production. The global value chain notion of multipolar governance, where influence derives from multiple nodes both inside and outside the supply chain, is blended with more-than-human assemblage perspectives to capture the implementation of targets. This conceptual fusion grasps how supply chain responsibility and influence works through both a distributed group of stakeholders and the ecological complexity of the AMR challenge. The paper demonstrates in turn: how the targets for reducing antibiotic use in domestic meat production represent a particular and narrowly defined strategic focus; how those targets have been met through distributed agency in the UK supply chain; and the geographical and biological limitations of the targets in tackling AMR as a wicked problem.","[Hughes, Alex; Hocknell, Suzanne] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Claremont Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Roe, Emma] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Highfield Campus, Southampton, Hants, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Southampton,"Hughes, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Claremont Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Alex.Hughes@ncl.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/P011586/1]; ESRC [ES/P011586/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number ES/P011586/1).",,43,12,12,1,18,,,,0308-518X,1472-3409,,,,SEP,2021,53,6,,,,,1373,1390,0308518X211015255,10.1177/0308518X211015255,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X211015255,,MAY 2021,,Environmental Studies; Geography,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simultaneously, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) evaluation appeared in the business and government to tackle sustainable development issues. Therefore, how to effectively govern the cold chain logistics service providers (CCLSPs) to perform better in ESG evaluation becomes an interesting research topic. This paper systematically analyzes the influence of digital twin service (DTS) on ESG evaluation and analytically investigates the long-term behavior of sustainability concerned stakeholders in the VLSC. Firstly, an architecture of DTS enabled ESG evaluation for VLSC is proposed to describe the DTS effectiveness. After that, a tripartite evolutionary game model in a two-tiered VLSC including CCLSPs, the public, and government regulators is proposed. And the conditions for the existence of equilibrium stable points are derived to capture the feature of the government incentives and the role of the public in the DTS investment decisions of CCLSPs. The governance mechanisms, such as the enactment of penalty and bonus, are discussed for facilitating the DTS investment in the VLSC to improve the ESG evaluation of CCLSPs. The association of the factors is validated by using analytical sensitivity analysis. The results manifest that government oversight will promote ESG improvement in the logistics market equipped with DTS. The public will be the driving force behind the refusal of CCLSPs to invest in DTS. It is evident that DTS can offer better solutions for the improvement of ESG assessment for VLSC with different strategic stakeholders.","[Zhang, Mengdi; Yang, Wanting] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Internet Things, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mengdi] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhiheng; Huang, George Q.

However, both contractual governance and guanxi, as the main governance tools, and their relationship to contractors' environmental be-haviors remain a black box and controversial. Therefore, this study examines the influence of contractual governance and guanxi on contractors' environmental behaviors and the mediating role of trust. We conducted a multiple regression analysis and Bootstrapping mediation test on a sample of 258 valid questionnaires to verify our research hypotheses. The results reveal that contractual governance has a significantly positive impact on contractors' environmental behaviors across three stages, while there is an inverted U-shaped relationship be-tween guanxi and contractors' environmental behaviors in the defensive stage. As guanxi increases and reaches a certain threshold, its effect on environmental behaviors in the defensive stage changes from promotion to in-hibition, with a diminishing marginal return. Furthermore, trust not only directly promotes the environmental behaviors of contractors but also has a mediating effect on the relationship between contractual governance and environmental behaviors in the defensive stage and on the relationship between guanxi and environmental be-haviors at all stages. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by delineating the path of project-level governance mechanisms on contractors' environmental behaviors and provides insightful management sugges-tions to promote the environmental performance of construction projects.","[Lin, Yi-Hsin] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Huijin] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Tongji University,"Zhang, HJ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",huijinzhang@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,125,6,7,6,58,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 1,2023,382,,,,,,,,135277,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135277,,NOV 2022,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This case study has relevance to emerging markets grappling with problems caused by monopolies and subsidies. Furthermore, this case study not only aims to improve operations of the LPG supply chain, but also re-designs its supply network to meet customers' expectations. It illustrates value creation through growth in non-domestic sales, a reduction in consumption of subsidized LPG as a consequence of better understanding of customer needs and customer diversity, process re-engineering and deployment of ICT systems, and change management and capability building across various LPG stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach An interpretive research methodology is applied, using an illustrative single case study of the Indian public sector-run LPG supply chain. The research methodology is iterative and exploratory in nature, consisting of a back and forth process between extant literature and the field, as well as in-depth discussions/interviews with senior management, distributors, and consumers. Findings Key supply chain capabilities of an integrated and seamless ICT system, detection and blocking of duplicate/ghost connections, the capping of entitlements, and coordination and collaboration across various stakeholders result in value creation for all stakeholders. When such collaboration across stakeholders' spans both vertically and horizontally through the supply chain, change management and capability building drive value creation through policy interventions and initiatives. Practical implications This study provides an illustrative example of meeting customers' expectations, increasing consumer convenience, and improving service levels, amidst the complex subsidy challenges in LPG distribution in India. The economic and environmental benefits, as well as increased customer satisfaction, from policy interventions regarding value creation in supply chains, have implications for similar public sector-run schemes. Social implications As a result of the various policy changes, the LPG subsidy was restricted to legitimate customers, reducing the fiscal burden on the Indian Government. Furthermore, seamless ICT-introduced efficiencies for government, distributers, and customers were attained. Originality/value This research articulates the capture, creation, and appropriation of value through the deployment of new supply chain initiatives in a large, complex environment, in particular the public sector-run LPG supply chain.","[Mittal, Neeraj] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Agarwal, Renu] Univ Technol Sydney, Univ Technol Business Sch, Management Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Selen, Willem] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Fac Arts Business & Law, Maroochydore, Australia",The World Bank; University of Technology Sydney; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Agarwal, R (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Univ Technol Business Sch, Management Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",renu.agarwal@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,116,11,12,5,46,,,,0957-4093,1758-6550,,,,,2018,29,1,,,,,64,89,,10.1108/IJLM-10-2016-0242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-10-2016-0242,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We apply this framework to two case studies: an open-air market promoting short food supply chains in France, and a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and several solidarity purchase groups (GAS) in Italy. Analysing the trajectories of the two initiatives, we highlight the processes through which new economic models are jointly built via interactions between different actors.

Nonetheless, this intensive model and the related globalized processing and marketing system poses a challenge to the conservation of biodiversity and to environmental sustainability. In addition, volatility on world cereal markets is threatening farmers' income, triggering diversification patterns. One of this pattern is the creation of alternative food chains intended as supply chains that are territorially embedded and able to reconnect producers with consumers. In this context, this paper aims to explore the diversity of alternative bread chains and valorisation practices, in order to identify organizational models, assess their economic performance in terms of creating added value distributing it along the stages of the chain and to understand the role played by ancient wheat varieties in differentiating the product. In order to do this, the paper develops a comparative case study analysis of several locally-based alternative bread supply chains in Tuscany (Italy). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors, selected considering all the steps in the supply chain: from growing the wheat and milling the grain through to the end product. From these interviews differences emerged between locally-based bread supply chains in terms of the valorisation system followed and the institutional arrangements. While the locally-based chains featuring modern wheat varieties have more conventional characteristics and pursue differentiation strategies based on certification, chains based on ancient wheat follow a more informal route, and product quality is mainly guaranteed by the reputation of the network. Furthermore, in the bread supply chains featuring ancient varieties, the methods for reducing transaction costs are linked to a bottom-up collective action, embeddedness strategies among stakeholders (that include also consumers), and are built on a relational approach based on trust, knowledge exchange and social networks. Results provide an assessment of the performances of different locally-based bread supply chains, identify critical aspects and suggest some policy implications for all types of chains.","[Sacchi, Giovanna; Belletti, Giovanni; Biancalani, Martina; Lombardi, GinevraVirginia; Stefani, Gianluca] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 32, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Sacchi, G (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 32, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",giovanna.sacchi@unifi.it; giovanni.belletti@unifi.it; martina.biancalani@gmail.com; ginevravirginia.lombardi@unifi.it; gianluca.stefani@unifi.it,,,"REGIONE TOSCANA, Tuscan Rural Development Plan (PSR) 2014-20 Integrated food chain project; LIFE project Semente partecipata [LIFE13 ENV/IT/001258]","REGIONE TOSCANA, Tuscan Rural Development Plan (PSR) 2014-20 Integrated food chain project; LIFE project Semente partecipata","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from:- REGIONE TOSCANA, Tuscan Rural Development Plan (PSR) 2014-20 Integrated food chain project, Grant 2015- LIFE project Semente partecipata (Project LIFE13 ENV/IT/001258).",,50,14,14,2,28,,,,0743-0167,,,,,OCT,2019,71,,,,,,23,35,,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.09.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.09.006,,,,Geography; Regional & Urban Planning,,Geography; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also examine buyer supply network accessibility as a moderating factor that facilitates collecting detailed information and undertaking corrective actions accordingly.Design/methodology/approachWe collected a sample of 428 focal buyer firms and their supply networks up to third-tier suppliers. Data were obtained from Bloomberg and RepRisk databases. We identified critical nexus suppliers using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and tested hypotheses using regression analysis.FindingsThe results show that the benefits of nexus supplier transparency, such as reducing buyer ESG risk exposure, differ depending on the type of nexus supplier disclosing information and buyer supply network accessibility. Informational nexus supplier transparency was found to be beneficial. However, the results revealed the double-edged sword of monopolistic nexus supplier transparency, which benefits buyers with higher levels of accessibility but increases risk exposure for buyers with lower accessibility.Originality/valueThis study demonstrates that the transparency of critical second-tier suppliers mitigates buyer ESG risk exposure by providing information about lower tiers in the supply network.

Governance mechanisms that prove effective in one agricultural sector are often applied to other sectors as well. For example, voluntary certification programs have been adopted by producers of commodities as diverse as beef, coffee, palm oil, and soy. However, there are substantial differences in the extent to which governance mechanisms scale up and achieve impact in different sectors. This paper analyzes how the potential for scaling up a particular governance mechanism is influenced by environmental, market, and social geographies that differ between sectors. Through stakeholder interviews, farm-level surveys, and a literature review, we examine two types of voluntary governance mechanisms (third-party certification, and sustainable intensification programs) in the coffee and cattle sectors in Brazil, to understand why the two governance mechanisms have scaled differently between these two sectors. We find that third-party certification programs have scaled up relatively well in Brazil's coffee sector, more so than its cattle sector, in part owing to differences in sustainability priorities, market orientations, supply chain traceability, and social networks between the two sectors. We also find that pilot sustainable intensification programs in the cattle sector have had more success than certification in engaging farmers, in part because they involve less investment from participating farmers. We conclude that the distribution and quality of environmental resources, markets, knowledge, actors, and networks can play an important role in the ability of a governance mechanism to effectively take root.

By highlighting the structural characteristics of global supply chains, we study how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) constrained by autocratic political regimes exploit the collaborative opportunities presented by foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enhance local firms' sustainability performance. Drawing on social movement and resource dependence theories, we propose that global supply chains that tie MNEs to their local partners offer these NGOs a favorable opportunity structure to gain leverage over local firms by establishing MNE-NGO collaborations. This two-step form of leverage helps NGOs increase their influence and legitimacy to facilitate the adoption of sustainable practices by local firms within the MNEs' global supply-chain networks. Yet, this mediated stakeholder effect decreases when governmentally produced structural conditions reduce the synergistic potential of this opportunity structure: greater priority given to environmental protection by governments substitutes for MNE-NGO collaborations. To test our theory, we examine the relationship between Chinese NGOs' collaborations with 167 MNEs across 24 countries and these MNEs' local green supply-chain ratings in the period 2014-2020.

While it has a promising impact on circular economy and international trade growth, increasing exports of used clothes and overflowing landfills raise some negative concerns on its overall sustainability. This paper addresses the dichotomy that exists in terms of interpreting the sustainability credentials of used clothes supply chains.Design/methodology/approach- A systematic literature review was carried out and 55 articles were examined to identify the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability impacts of used clothes supply chains. TBL sustainability issues were identified, reflected through the lens of natural resource-based view and interpreted in the form of propositions.Findings- The paper pinpoints seven TBL sustainability concerns and prescribes three sets of strategic resources required in glocal used clothes supply chains for mitigating these. These are (1) slowing the supply chain by tackling poor quality, overproduction and oversupply issues, (2) improving logistics/supply chain infrastructure and ecosystem collaboration and (2) embedding transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures taken by both value chain actors and regulatory bodies, for embracing system-level sustainable development.Originality/value- This is one of the first studies to analyse TBL sustainability of glocal north-south used clothes supply chains. The study is unique in terms of its scope and contribution to the sustainable supply chain literature.","[Dissanayake, Kanchana] Univ Boras, Swedish Sch Text, Dept Business Adm & Text Management, Boras, Sweden; [Dissanayake, Kanchana] Univ Moratuwa, Dept Text & Apparel Engn, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka; [Pal, Rudrajeet] Univ Boras, Dept Business Adm & Text Management, Boras, Sweden; [Pal, Rudrajeet] Univ Gavle, Dept Ind Management, Ind Design & Mech Engn, Gavle, Sweden",University of Boras; University Moratuwa; University of Boras; University of Gavle,"Dissanayake, K (corresponding author), Univ Boras, Swedish Sch Text, Dept Business Adm & Text Management, Boras, Sweden.;Dissanayake, K (corresponding author), Univ Moratuwa, Dept Text & Apparel Engn, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.",kanchana.dissanayake@hb.se; rudrajeet.pal@hb.se,,,Familjen Kamprads Stiftelse [20200105],Familjen Kamprads Stiftelse,"This work was supported by Familjen Kamprads Stiftelse, Project Ref.

There are conflicting arguments regarding the effectiveness of contract governance and collaboration in an interfirm relationship. Previous studies have investigated the effect of a national culture on contract governance and opportunism. This study examines the effects of contract governance on collaboration, incorporating the moderating influence of cultural intelligence. Survey data were collected from 239 export manufacturing firms in different industries. The current authors suggest that contract governance might be more effective under conditions of a greater level of firm cultural intelligence capabilities. Cultural intelligence plays an important role in the shaping and implementation of collaboration and is the key to manage cross-culture relationship management in a supply chain. Cultural intelligence constitutes one potential way for the export industry to manage intercultural differences and profitably achieve an increase in collaboration. Collaboration with a socially responsible partner brings about improved social performance. The social dimensions of sustainability, such as fair labor practices and decent worker conditions, health and safety, no child labor, and employee empowerment must be addressed to accomplish the most sustainable growth. Managers also need to take advantage of cultural intelligence to adapt, collaborate, and share cultural knowledge.","[Awan, Usama; Kraslawski, Andrzej; Huiskonen, Janne] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Ind Engn & Management, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland; [Awan, Usama] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari 61100, Pakistan; [Kraslawski, Andrzej] Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Proc & Environm Engn, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); Lodz University of Technology,"Awan, U (corresponding author), Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Ind Engn & Management, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland.;Awan, U (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Management Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari 61100, Pakistan.",usama.awan@lut.fi; Andrzej.Kraslawski@lut.fi; Janne.Huiskonen@lut.fi,,,,,,,90,95,100,5,62,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4473,10.3390/su10124473,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124473,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The supply chain (SC) is a buyer's responsibility and accounts for a large part of their ESG footprint. Since ESG performance extends to SC, poor ESG practices in the SC can negatively affect the sustainability of the Anchor Company (AC). Therefore, AC, the buyer, needs to go through a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process to assess their SC. The objective of this work is to develop an ESG assessment model for companies to receive a quantitative score of their footprint by considering both their operations and the SC. The model is verified by considering different scenarios that are designed by testing two different cases with different interactions between two ACs and two SCs with different ESG maturity levels. Results show that the SC has a significant impact on the final ESG score of the AC, highlighting the need for considering the SC to evolve in ESG aspects. In all tested cases, the SC accounted for more than 50% of the final consolidated ESG score. Despite differing ESG maturity levels, two ACs received the same consolidated score due to the influence of their SC scores. Results emphasize that achieving a strong consolidated ESG score is important, and advanced corporate sustainability is not possible without integrating the SC into the strategy. The novel methodology proposed contributes to sustainability, expanding the scope of ESG assessments to include SC and developing a standardized and adaptable model with practical applications.","[Savi, Antonio; Santos, Luan] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Prod Engn Program PEP COPPE UFRJ, 21S41972, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Santos, Luan] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Fac Business Adm & Accounting Sci FACC UFRJ, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Savi, Marcelo] Fed Univ Rio Janeiro, Mech Engn Program PEM COPPE UFRJ, BR-21941914 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Savi, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Prod Engn Program PEP COPPE UFRJ, 21S41972, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",antoniosavi@gmail.com; luan.santos@pep.ufrj.br; savi@mecanica.ufrj.br,,,Brazilian Research Agencies CNPq; CAPES; FAPERJ,Brazilian Research Agencies CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)),"This research was funded by Brazilian Research Agencies CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ.",,28,1,1,7,7,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB,2025,17,3,,,,,,,1158,10.3390/su17031158,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17031158,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sceptics of private regulation point to the powerful state-business patronage networks in these countries as structural impediments to reforming this sector. Drawing on the literature on global production networks, I show how producers deeply embedded within such supportive local political economies nevertheless choose to comply with stringent global private standards to reduce risks to their global operations. It was the renewed emphasis on supply chain traceability to demonstrate responsible corporate behaviour to investors, buyers and consumers that served to embed globally-oriented palm oil plantation firms and their upstream suppliers into emerging ethical supply chains. Embedding occurs through three social processes - surveillance, normalising judgement and knowledge transfer. The private regulatory developments analysed in this article, though relatively recent, are supported by a diverse transnational coalition of principled and instrumental interests and have created significant openings for a new, or at least, parallel, and more progressive, private regulatory order in Malaysia and Indonesia.","[Nesadurai, Helen E.

This paper compares different SGB supply chain designs with a focus on mobile pyrolysis plants and centralized versus decentralized collection of biomass in terms of economic and environmental sustainability. Pyrolysis scenarios are also compared to fuel-upgrading and electricity production scenarios. The empirical context of this paper is based on a scenario analysis for processing lignocellulosic biomass, particularly landscape wood, reed and roadside grass available in the Overijssel region (Eastern Netherlands). Four scenarios are compared: (1) mobile pyrolysis plant processes the locally available biomass on-site into pyrolysis oil which is sent to a regional biofuel production unit for upgrading to marketable biofuel; (2) local biomass is collected and transported to a regional pyrolysis-based biofuel production unit for upgrading to a marketable biofuel; (3) mobile pyrolysis plant performs the on-site conversion to pyrolysis oil which is transported to an oil refinery outside the region (Rotterdam); and (4) collected biomass is sent to the nearest electricity production unit to generate electricity. The results show that processing SGB is costly and upgraded oil and refined oil are at least 65% more expensive compared to their fossil counterparts. In terms of economic and environmental performance, the mobile plant performs slightly better than a fixed plant. The energy output/input ratio range is between 6.99 and 7.54 and CO2 emissions range is between 96 and 138 kg CO2/t upgraded oil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It empirically investigates the relationships among green supply chain knowledge networks, green technology innovation, knowledge integration capability, and ESG performance. The results show that the structural characteristics of the knowledge network positively affect ESG performance and that the relational characteristics exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with ESG performance. Green technology innovation mediates the relationship between knowledge network characteristics and ESG performance. Furthermore, knowledge integration capability positively moderates the relationship between knowledge network characteristics and green technology innovation.

To address this issue, this work proposes an Extended Multi-regional Input-Output model (EMRIO) that incorporates import dependence and governance along the value chain. As case study, two alternative energy investments in Mexico - a Natural Gas Power plant (NG) and a Concentrated Solar Power plant (CSP) - are assessed. The method quantifies the geographical diversification of suppliers and the quality of governance. The assessment of the case study shows that the supply chain of the CSP plant includes more countries and with better governance levels than the supply chain of the NG power plant. That means, a priori, that the supply risks of investing in CSP power plants will be lower, as will suppliers' endogenous geopolitical risk. However, a sensitivity analysis considering different providers of the solar plant components reveals that CSP plant value chain could also entail similar or even higher governance risks levels as the NG plant. The scenario where China provides some of the components entails a much higher governance risks, even higher than the NG base case. In consequence, we have proved that the method proposed allows the identification of hidden geopolitical risks that would otherwise go unnoticed. This paper enlarges the existing knowledge on assessment methodologies for energy policy decision-support by measuring diversification and imports dependence from countries with different levels of governance along the whole value chain.","[Gamarra, Ana Rosa; Lechon, Yolanda; Caldes, Natalia] CIEMAT, Energy Dept, Energy Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Gamarra, Ana Rosa] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Madrid, Spain; [Escribano, Gonzalo; Lazaro, Lara] Royal Inst Elcano RIE, Madrid, Spain; [Lilliestam, Johan] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies IASS, Potsdam, Germany; [Lilliestam, Johan] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Caldes, Natalia] DG INTPA European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Potsdam","Gamarra, AR (corresponding author), CIEMAT, E1 P0 D45,Av Complutense S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",anarosa.gamarra@ciemat.es; yolanda.lechon@ciemat.es; gescribano@rielcano.org; johan.lilliestam@iass-potsdam.de; llazaro@rielcano.org; natalia.caldes-gomez@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,88,11,11,2,14,,,,0195-9255,1873-6432,,,,MAR,2022,93,,,,,,,,106708,10.1016/j.eiar.2021.106708,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2021.106708,,NOV 2021,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The network approach enables a comprehensive understanding of FSNs by analyzing interactions and dynamics among actors and processes, facilitating effective management. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted to identify the contributions and advances that the network approach has triggered in FSN studies. An upward trend in papers published yearly over the past twenty years was identified, focusing on system dynamics, traceability, management, market influences, environmental impacts, and governance. Advancements include understanding how relationships between actors influence system performance and highlighting stakeholder involvement's critical role in collaborative solutions. The main limitations identified are data collection and availability, the infrequency of linking social and ecological systems, and the complexity of building dynamics models. Despite these challenges, the network approach is indispensable for better understanding FSNs and driving sustainable management and conservation initiatives. Finally, we propose five best practices for FSN studies, including 1) mapping actors or processes, 2) enhancing data collection, 3) network modeling, 4) scenario evaluation, and 5) ethical considerations.

We conclude that the nature of corn and soybean production, distribution, and consumption-with numerous sales outlets and invisible consumption as part of processed foods and other products-makes certification schemes to limit agricultural pollution unrealistic and supply chain standards extremely challenging.","[Waldman, Kurt B.; Kerr, John M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Waldman, KB (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jkerr@anr.msu.edu,,,,,,,78,41,49,0,36,,,,1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4706-2,,,,2014,6,,,,,,429,449,,10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012432,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012432,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Environmental Studies,,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whilst approaches to risk governance have been evolving for more than a decade, recent disasters have shown that conventional risk management solutions need to be complemented with a multidimensional risk approach to govern complex risks and prevent major, often simultaneous, crises with cascading and knock-on effects on multiple, interrelated systems at scale. The paper explores which risk governance innovations will be essential to provide the enabling environment for sustainable development that is resilient to interrelated shocks and risks.Design/methodology/approach- This interdisciplinary literature review-based thought piece highlights how systemic risk is socially constructed and identifies guiding principles for systemic risk governance that could be actionable by and provide entry points for local and national governments, civil society and the private sector. particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), in a way that is relevant to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This considers preparedness, response and resilience, but more importantly prospective and corrective risk control and reduction strategies and mechanisms. Only when systemic risk is framed in a way that is relevant to the political agendas of countries will it be possible to begin a dialogue for its governance.Findings- The paper identifies opportunities at the global, national and local levels, which together draw up a viable framework for systemic risk governance that (1) embraces the governance of sustainability and resilience through a strengthened holistic governance framework for social, economic, territorial and environmental development; (2) improves managing conventional risk to ultimately manage systemic risks; (3) fosters the understanding of vulnerability and exposure to gain insight into systemic risk; (4) places a greater focus on prospective risk management; (5) manages systemic risk in local infrastructure systems, supply chains and ecosystems; (6) shifts the focus from protecting privatized gains to managing socialized risk.Originality/value- The choices and actions that societies take on the path of their development are contributing intentionally or unintentionally to the construction of systemic risks, which result in knock-on effects among interconnected social, environmental, political and economic systems. These risks are manifesting in major crises with cascading effects and a real potential to undermine the achievement of the SDGs, as COVID-19 is a stark reminder of. This paper offers the contours of a new risk governance paradigm that is able to navigate the new normal in a post-COVID world and is equipped to manage systemic risk.","[Maskrey, Andrew] Risk Nexus Initiat, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Jain, Garima] Indian Inst Human Settlements, Bangalore, India; [Lavell, Allan] FLACSO, San Jose, Costa Rica",Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS),"Maskrey, A (corresponding author), Risk Nexus Initiat, San Jose, Costa Rica.",andrew.maskrey@gmail.com; garimajain2002@gmail.com; allanmlavell@gmail.com,,,UNDP Crisis Bureau's Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery for Building Resilience Team,UNDP Crisis Bureau's Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery for Building Resilience Team,"This work was financially supported by the UNDP Crisis Bureau's Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery for Building Resilience Team under the supervision of Ronald Jackson and Angelika Planitz.

The institutional environment, in particular environmental laws and regulations, has a beneficial impact on collaboration and relationship management in sustainable supply chains. Two studies in this special volume show, however, that stringent environmental regulations may hinder economic performance and result in outsourcing to foreign suppliers with potential detrimental effects for environmental performance.

However, to realize the potential of the OAC market, a better understanding of the market demand for OAC, as well as the quality and production standards under which the brands operate, the institutional frameworks, and the market mechanisms that underpin its commercialization, is needed. We evaluated the existing organic markets in Brazil using an interview-based methodology with key stakeholders throughout the organic cotton supply chain in 2022. Our study revealed that some brands are willing to pay prices ranging from USD$ 2.57 to USD$ 4.61 per kg of cotton lint depending on the brand. These brands require suppliers to meet quality specifications for the cotton fiber; for example, they require average to long fibers and specify harvesting practices that influence fiber quality. There are also social and environmental criteria that prioritize vulnerable communities of family farmers and women groups planting cotton based on established sustainable practices. The institutional framework includes different stakeholders throughout the organic cotton supply chain, which is fundamentally driven by private demand for cotton, counts on the support of agents connecting brands to farmers, and is indirectly supported by public policies. Existing markets for organic cotton are established via contracts that provide farmers with guarantees to invest in planting cotton and have different certification systems used by the brands that monitor and verify adherence to the standards. Market demand for OAC may, therefore, potentially lead to new markets that promote sustainable supply chains and farming practices. However, existing markets for organic cotton reveal complex requirements that must be addressed, such as the need for supporting agents connecting brands to farmers, and market mechanisms, such as complex contracts and certification.","[Silva, Rhyllary Coelho e; Medina, Gabriel da Silva] Univ Brasilia, Fac Agron & Vet Med, BR-70910900 Brasilia, Brazil; [Camargo, Ricardo de Siqueira] Agr Family Sch Uirapuru Goias, BR-76525000 Uirapuru, Brazil; [Gatti, Mariana] FarFarm, Ave Coronel Marcos 483-11, BR-91760000 Porto Alegre, Brazil; [Sevigne-Itoiz, Eva; Di Lucia, Lorenzo; Mwabonje, Onesmus N.

However, they often fail to comprehensively address the needs and interests of various supply-chain participants. While voluntary in nature, MSIs have most often been implemented through coercive approaches, resulting in friction among their participants and in systemic problems with decoupling. Additionally, in those cases in which deliberation was constrained between and amongst participants, collaborative approaches have often failed to materialize. Our framework focuses on two key aspects of these breakdowns: assumptions about the orientation of MSI participants, and the deliberation processes that participants use to engage with each other to create these initiatives and sustain them over time. Drawing from stakeholder and deliberation theories, we revisit the concept of MSIs and show how their deliberative capacity may be enhanced in order to encourage participants to collaborate voluntarily.","[Soundararajan, Vivek] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Brown, Jill A.] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Wicks, Andrew C.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Bath; Bentley University; University of Virginia,"Soundararajan, V (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England.",,,,,,,,100,64,68,4,30,,,,1052-150X,2153-3326,,,,JUL,2019,29,3,,,,,385,412,PII S1052150X18000386,10.1017/beq.2018.38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/beq.2018.38,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While state actors continue to guide sustainability efforts within their jurisdictions, the onus is increasingly placed on corporations who pronounce their own measures to eliminate deforestation and other unethical practices associated with their business operations. In this contribution, we analyze the publicly available action plans from all corporate signatories to the Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI), a novel zero-deforestation commitment that focuses mainly on the world's top cocoa producers: Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. We construct a CFI index to systematically compare company pledges and uncover any relationships between the strength or quality of a company's CFI action plan and key company characteristics. We find that, contrary to what the literature would suggest, the consumer-facing and high brand value firms are pronouncing less stringent zero-deforestation commitments as compared to their upstream partners.

Specifically, we focus on the dyadic relationships between farmers and different types of buyers, including besides lead firms, intermediaries, and wholesalers, which have received little attention in the scientific literature. Our analysis focuses on formal and informal contracts as governance forms between farmers and buyers, and explores the correlation between contract provisions (e.g., quality, quantity, and the provision of services), relationship attributes (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and opportunism) and adoption of SAPs. We gathered survey data from 352 vegetable farmers in Chile and employed analysis of variance and logit modeling for our analysis. Our findings indicate that small-scale farmers primarily engage with intermediaries using informal contracts, while medium-scale farmers trade with wholesalers through spot markets, and large-scale farmers with lead firms using formal contracts. We also found that farmers who traded through informal contracts, mainly with intermediaries, reported greater satisfaction in the farmer-buyer relationship than farmers trading through formal contracts. However, farmers engaging in informal contracts were less likely to adopt SAPs than farmers trading through formal contracts. Our results suggest that the governance form (contracts or spot market) adopted for the relationship between farmers and buyers influences the adoption of SAPs, while the impact of relationship attributes on SAP adoption is less clear. A deeper understanding of buyers and their relationship with farmers is essential to enhance policies encouraging SAP adoption in regional and local fresh food supply chains.

This article makes important contributions to the emerging literature on ESG risk management and corporate sustainability in the agri-food industry, notably by mapping such risks and by summarizing the main practices used by agri-food companies to manage them.","[Boiral, Olivier; Brotherton, Marie-Christine] Laval Univ, Fac Business Adm, Management Sch, Pavillon Palasis Prince,2325 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Talbot, David] Natl Sch Publ Adm ENAP, Ctr Governance Res CERGO, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Guillaumie, Laurence] Laval Univ, Fac Nursing, Pavillon Ferdinand Vandry, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Brotherton, MC (corresponding author), Laval Univ, Fac Business Adm, Management Sch, Pavillon Palasis Prince,2325 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",marie-christine.brotherton.1@ulaval.ca,,,Centre interuniversitaire de recherche en analyse des organisations (CIRANO) [8149]; Canada Research Chair in Internalization of Sustainability Practices and Organizational Accountability,Centre interuniversitaire de recherche en analyse des organisations (CIRANO); Canada Research Chair in Internalization of Sustainability Practices and Organizational Accountability,This work was supported by the Canada Research Chair in Internalization of Sustainability Practices and Organizational Accountability; and the Centre interuniversitaire de recherche en analyse des organisations (CIRANO) (project number 8149).,,96,2,2,20,40,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,NOV,2024,31,6,,,,,5690,5708,,10.1002/csr.2884,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2884,,JUN 2024,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to investigate the positioning of the CLS within the environmental policy-legal framework and identify its implementation challenges from a legal perspective. Employing a normative analysis method, the study comprehensively examines administrative regulatory documents, standardization documents, and industry self-regulation norms issued since 2010 by central and local governments, as well as industry self-regulatory associations. The findings reveal that the CLS remains a policy tool rather than a legislative tool, with no formal legislative regulation currently in place. To address this gap, the study proposes a comprehensive framework to establish a legal foundation for the CLS by defining its legal principles, clarifying its attributes, and constructing specific legal and oversight systems. This transformation would formalize the CLS as a legislative tool, thereby promoting green supply chain transformation and optimizing decision-making. These findings provide valuable insights for scholars, policymakers, and legislators, offering a practical roadmap for advancing CLS legislation and supporting China's dual carbon targets.","[Qi, Jiangang; Yu, Zhaodi] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Res Ctr Intellectual Property, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhaodi] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Coll Law, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yu, ZD (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Res Ctr Intellectual Property, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuzhaodi@stu.zuel.edu.cn,,,Major project of the National Social Science Fund of China Research on the Modernization of Industrial Intellectual Property Risk Governance under the Overall National Security Concept [21ZD203],Major project of the National Social Science Fund of China Research on the Modernization of Industrial Intellectual Property Risk Governance under the Overall National Security Concept,This research was funded by Major project of the National Social Science Fund of China Research on the Modernization of Industrial Intellectual Property Risk Governance under the Overall National Security Concept (21&ZD203).,,87,0,0,18,18,,,,1758-3004,1758-3012,,,,DEC 31,2025,16,1,,,,,,,2451859,10.1080/17583004.2025.2451859,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2025.2451859,,,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fill this gap, our study empirically examines I4.0-Tech's impact on SUS through SCV and CEP. We utilized structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships using data from a survey of 344 medium and large Chinese firms. The empirical findings support the indirect role of I4.0 through SCV, and CEP. I4.0-Tech enables real-time material and product tracking for SCV. Optimizing material utilization, fostering closed-loop supply chains, and allowing circular product design enhance CEP. Furthermore, our findings show a positive relationship between SCV, CEP, and SUS. This highlights the need for robust supply chain capabilities in enabling I4.0-Tech to drive SUS. This paradigm emphasizes recalibrating approaches to SCV and CEP-focused frameworks to easily include and exploit I4.0-Tech.

More recently, buyers added improved environmental performance as a new requirement for their suppliers, seeking to avoid brand risks in their supply chains due to consumer awareness. This environmental upgrading focused on ecoefficiency gains, which increased productivity among suppliers while using fewer resources, but buyers captured most of the benefits in terms of maintaining low prices due to market power imbalances. This article aims to shift the debate on the limits of participating in global supply chains by conceptualizing the opportunities available to late industrializing countries from embedding the environmental upgrading of individual supplier firms within a broader green industrialization process, which offers more opportunities for value capture and inter-industry linkages through circular industrial economies. We use this conceptual approach to examine the newest apparel sourcing location, Ethiopia, and the government's green industrial policy that aimed to spur industrialization through apparel specific eco-industrial parks.","[Jensen, Federico; Whitfield, Lindsay] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Whitfield, L (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",lwh.msc@cbs.dk,,,Danish Council for Independent Research in the Social Sciences [DFF 4182-00099]; Institute of Social Science and Business at Roskilde University,Danish Council for Independent Research in the Social Sciences; Institute of Social Science and Business at Roskilde University,"Acknowledgements This research was financed by the Danish Council for Independent Research in the Social Sciences, grant number DFF 4182-00099.

The short food supply chain (SFSC) becomes one of the crucial solutions for these issues. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of the SFSC, assess the short vegetable supply chain (SVSC) in Vietnam, identify its barriers and challenges, and explore interventions and support as key success factors of the SVSC by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This study initially proposes the SFSC framework with six pillars and 28 indicators, this model is used to assess the SVSC. The results show that the SVSC brings various social, economic, and environmental benefits: First, it can increase farmers' income, employment, fairness, and health. Second, the SVSC can decrease environmental pollution, food waste, and energy consumption. Third, it can improve food quality and consumers' health. Fourth, the SVSC enhances on-farm education, agricultural tourism, local livestock farming, and traditional culture and relationship. However, the SVSC encounters various barriers and challenges impeding its performances and benefits. The vegetable value chain gains several interventions and support from the government and the project to overcome these barriers. Overall, the SFSC, good agricultural practice, and sustainability are strongly associated: good agricultural practice and sustainability are inherent in the SFSC.","[Hoang, Viet] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam",,"Hoang, V (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.",viet.hoang@ueh.edu.vn,,,,,,,66,18,19,9,55,,,,,2073-4395,,,,DEC,2021,11,12,,,,,,,2408,10.3390/agronomy11122408,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11122408,,,,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, it explores the environmental upgrading of developing country firms in global value chains. This research, conducted with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, involves 24 Tunisian olive oil companies. The findings indicate that exporting companies have indeed benefited from environmental upgrading, but, because of the cooperation strategy adopted by leading western firms (imposition of standards) and the absence of financial and technical assistance, the extent of environmental upgrading remains limited.

Despite its claim to establish global rules, PG usually has national origins, and multiple efforts to address the same issue from different national perspectives frequently coexist. Numerous studies have explored the impact of national business systems on companies' domestic CSR practices, yet little is known about what factors shape CSR practices like PG internationally. Therefore, this study seeks to understand how differing domestic contexts shape approaches to CSR in the form of PG in host countries. I explore this empirically through the comparative case study of competing PG initiatives in the post-Rana Plaza Bangladesh garment industry, uniquely conceived to govern companies' practices rather than certify products. It combines empirical findings with the comparative CSR literature to hypothesize about ideal types of PG organizing in US and European contexts. It extends the analysis to also account for other influential factors, such as stakeholder pressure, thus demonstrating how institutional and agentic factors amalgamate to shape firms' choices. By explicating linkages between international PG and its domestic context, as well as between the comparative CSR and PG literature studies, this study extends our understanding of how and why international PG practices and preferences vary for firms originating from different environments.","[Leitheiser, Erin] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Dalgas Have 15,2O-060, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Leitheiser, E (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Dalgas Have 15,2O-060, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",el.msc@cbs.dk,,,Velux Fonden via the Endowed Chair for Corporate Sustainability at Copenhagen Business School,Velux Fonden via the Endowed Chair for Corporate Sustainability at Copenhagen Business School,"I acknowledge funding support from Velux Fonden via the Endowed Chair for Corporate Sustainability at Copenhagen Business School.

Multi-stakeholder collaborations are a popular hybrid governance approach to development, including NGOs' work to integrate smallholder farmers into supermarket supply chains. As a result, NGOs' service provision role has expanded to include market facilitation, often necessitating NGOs act as market intermediaries. This paper explores how this new role may jeopardize NGOs' organizational legitimacy in the eyes of their constituents, other development organizations, and supermarket partners, and therefore ultimately affect their ability to represent civil society in hybrid governance arrangements. Drawing on qualitative data collected in the Central American country of Honduras, this paper focuses on NGOs' role organizing producer associations to facilitate access to Wal-Mart supermarkets. Findings suggest that a lack of supply chain transparency, NGOs' negotiation between commercial and aid-oriented goals, and the potential to exclude producers from development projects threaten NGOs' legitimacy. These findings illustrate the difficulties of embedding philanthropic activities in market-based systems, and demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaborations may be influenced more by commercial priorities than the elements of a partnership. Ultimately, development NGOs are products of neoliberal, hybrid governance, even as their activities are expected to ease the transition of small-scale producers into this system.","N Carolina State Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Youth Family & Community Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Bloom, JD (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Youth Family & Community Sci, Campus Box 7606, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",dara_bloom@ncsu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation Dissertation Research Improvement Grant [1103180]; USDA's National Institute for Food and Agriculture [2011-67011-30760]; Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment; Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences Graduate Research Award; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1103180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NIFA [579295, 2011-67011-30760] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","National Science Foundation Dissertation Research Improvement Grant; USDA's National Institute for Food and Agriculture; Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment; Penn State University College of Agricultural Sciences Graduate Research Award; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food & Agriculture)","Many thanks to my doctoral advisor, Clare Hinrichs, and members of my doctoral dissertation committee, including Leland Glenna, Stephan Goetz, Karl Zimmerer, James McCarthy, and Anouk Patel-Campillo, for feedback and input on earlier drafts of this paper.

It is concluded therefore that while the findings lend weight to policy initiatives to utilise the power dynamics in supply chains to protect working conditions, they also suggest that surrounding institutional and industrial contexts exert a potentially crucial influence over their effectiveness.

Yet, to date little attention has been paid by social scientists to how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are addressed as part of private agri-food governance arrangements. This paper examines how private actors within agri-food supply chains respond to emerging pressure for measures to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture. Drawing upon the Anglo-Foucauldian governmentality literature, we introduce the notion of the corporate carbon economy to conceptualise the practical techniques that enable private agri-food actors to make GHG emissions thinkable and governable in the context of existing market, regulatory, and supply chain pressures. Using a case study of the Australian dairy industry, we argue that private agri-food actors utilise a range of techniques that enable them to respond to existing government environmental regulations, balance current market pressures with future supply chain requirements, and demonstrate improved eco-efficiency along food supply chains. These techniques - which include environmental self-assessment instruments, tools for measuring GHG emissions, and sustainability reporting - have little direct relevance to the 'international climate regime' of carbon trading, and carbon markets more broadly, yet individually and in combination they are crucial in enacting an alternative regime of GHG governance. In concluding, we contend that the growing use of sustainability metrics by international food companies is likely to have the most powerful implications for GHG governance in the agri-food sector, with potentially far-reaching consequences for how future action on climate change is rendered thinkable and practicable.

An Innovation-Intensive Environment Perspective,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,Financial technology (Fintech); sustainable supply chain management; green innovation (GI); digital innovation policy (DIP); top management team innovation orientation,PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; FUTURE; TRANSFORMATION; DIRECTIONS; RESILIENCE; DISRUPTION; GOVERNANCE,"Financial technology, or Fintech, is used to describe disruptive new technologies that help firms manage their financial operations and improve the cost effectiveness of customer services. However, the role of Fintech adoption in sustainable supply chain management performance is unclear. Using the panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2018 to 2022, in this article, we empirically demonstrate that Fintech adoption can significantly improve sustainable supply chain management performance. This improvement is primarily attributed to Fintech's ability to enhance information transparency and refine decision-making capabilities, thereby fostering sustainability. Furthermore, green innovation, digital innovation policies, top management team forward-looking innovation orientation, and persistent innovation orientation strengthen the relationship between Fintech adoption and sustainable supply chain management performance. Green innovation enables firms to comply with environmental regulations and gain a competitive advantage, thereby facilitating the integration of Fintech into sustainable supply chain management. Digital innovation policies provide regulatory support and establish norms, creating a conducive environment for technology applications. The innovation orientation of the top management team drives the continuous optimization of supply chain processes and services through Fintech. This research contributes to the current industrial sustainability debate by integrating Fintech adoption and sustainable supply chain management from an innovation-intensive environment perspective.","[Jia, Fu; Guo, Jiguang] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lujie] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Islam, Nazrul] Univ East London, Royal Docks Sch Business & Law, London E16 2RD, England",Capital University of Economics & Business; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; University of East London,"Chen, LJ (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.",jiguang_guo@163.com; Lujie.chen@xjtlu.edu.cn; nazrul.islam@uel.ac.uk,,,"Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund [23JCA011]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2024J01214]; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University [IBSSDF-0524-76, REF-23-02-002]; Academic Novices Program for Doctoral Students of Capital University of Economics and Business [2025XSXR04]",Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Academic Novices Program for Doctoral Students of Capital University of Economics and Business,"This work was supported in part by the Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund under Grant 23JCA011, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province under Grant 2024J01214, in part by Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University under Grant IBSSDF-0524-76 and Grant REF-23-02-002, and in part by the Academic Novices Program for Doctoral Students of Capital University of Economics and Business under Grant 2025XSXR04.",,125,0,0,34,34,,,,0018-9391,1558-0040,,,,,2025,72,,,,,,210,226,,10.1109/TEM.2024.3515471,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2024.3515471,,,,"Business; Engineering, Industrial; Management",,Business & Economics; Engineering,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing upon recent writing on 'embeddedness', we argue that certification provides an important focus for exploring the relationship and tensions between horizontal and vertical dimensions of embedding processes, and thereby understanding the complexities of agri-environmental governance. Through a case study of a group of beef farmers in southeastern Australia, we investigate how one type of process-based certification-Environmental Management Systems (EMSs)-was used as the basis for constructing an AAFN and selling a premium environmentally certified product. The case study shows that environmental certification had mixed results for this AAFN. For instance, while it represented a useful means of building consumer trust, considerable time and effort was required by producers to target and build a market for the certified product. Producers initially had little to gain financially from a third-party-certified EMS. However, despite the current lack of broad consumer demand for non-organic environmentally certified products, the farmers we interviewed did not reject the EMS process entirely-they used it to realise a range of non-monetary personal and community benefits. We conclude that certification can be it useful strategy for those AAFNs in the process of expanding beyond direct marketing. Nevertheless, the lack of consumer understanding and demand means that certification may be adapted and combined with other producer strategies to meet personal and societal expectations regarding land stewardship.

It can spark the economic development of poor regions, but at the same time it is associated with severe sustainability issues, particularly in areas with governance deficits. Recent developments have spurred a vibrant debate on how to achieve the development opportunities while minimizing the sustainability impacts. As a result, voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI) originated with differing foci, aims, and organizational designs. Such MSIs for responsible mining can be interpreted as a social innovation from two perspectives: (1) stakeholder groups cooperate to complement, concretize, initiate, and prepare, but also compete with other forms of governance and possibly replace them; (2) the MSIs support implementing responsible mining in practice. A structured review of 20 MSIs' documents along an analytical framework covering governance, change in practice, and diffusion shows that the two roles of MSIs can hardly be separated, as the change in practice is enabled via a change in governance. Moreover, the MSIs are found to be a valuable complement to traditional governance of responsible mining, as they transcend national borders, allow for the inclusion of informal miners into professionalization, and offer support to companies to enhance their sustainability performance. Nevertheless, the MSIs are voluntary and relatively young. This limits their power and requires further research for which six avenues are identified in this paper.","[Sauer, Philipp C.] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Hiete, Michael] Ulm Univ, Professorship Business Chem, D-89081 Ulm, Germany",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Ulm University,"Sauer, PC (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",psauer@unibz.it; michael.hiete@uni-ulm.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01UT140],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research and the APC was funded by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Research for Sustainability (FONA) platform, funding priority Social-Ecological Research (SOF) and funding program Sustainable Economy (grant no. 01UT140, project Nachhaltig gewonnene mineralische Rohstoffe, NamiRo, 2015 to 2018).",,87,17,17,0,23,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JAN,2020,12,1,,,,,,,236,10.3390/su12010236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12010236,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Identifying opportunities for more effective governance of the palm oil value chain and supply landscapes, this paper explores disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between public regulations and private standards, looking at the global, national, and subnational policy domains shaping chain actors' conduct. Greater complementarities have emerged among transnational instruments, but state regulation disconnects persist and antagonisms prevail between national state regulations and transnational private standards. Emerging experimental approaches, particularly at subnational level, aim to improve coordination to both enhance complementarities and resolve disconnects.","[Pacheco, Pablo] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Pacheco, Pablo; Dermawan, Ahmad; Komarudin, Heru] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Schoneveld, George] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Nairobi, Kenya; [Djama, Marcel] Univ Putra Malaysia, CIRAD Agr Res Dev, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",World Wildlife Fund; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Pacheco, P (corresponding author), World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",pablo.pacheco@wwf.org,,,United States Agency for International Development through the Governing Oil-palm Landscapes for Sustainability (GOLS) Project; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH,United States Agency for International Development through the Governing Oil-palm Landscapes for Sustainability (GOLS) Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH,"This work was partly funded by the United States Agency for International Development through the Governing Oil-palm Landscapes for Sustainability (GOLS) Project, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.

This article finds that there are important trade-offs between environmental sustainability and inclusive development. First, there is a worry that the diffusion of standards that aim at enhancing environmental sustainability may undermine the socioeconomic situation of smallholders by excluding them from global value chains and from international markets that demand certified commodities. Second, while smallholder certification can generate socioeconomic benefits for farmers included in certification schemes, these potential benefits may have contradictory and undesired implications for environmental sustainability. The article analyses these trade-offs and discusses implications with a view to fostering the synergies between economic, environmental and social sustainability.

However, urgently decarbonizing energy use and systems by shifting to renewables relies on intensifying global supply chains, beginning with the extraction of critical minerals, an industry that has a long history of generating significant social and ecological harms. This paper examines the nature of transnational governance initiatives that have emerged to regulate what has been called renewables extractivism. We develop a novel database of 44 transnational initiatives for governing minerals for onshore wind, solar PV, and lithium-ion batteries, which are driving renewable energy uptake. The database reveals governance gaps that refer to an absence of rules for many critical minerals and accountability traps where actors are held responsible for processes, standards, and sanctions that reflect their own normative logics, rather than the needs of affected communities and ecosystems. Current initiatives are designed in a way that measures, evaluates, and (very rarely) sanctions governance outcomes primarily in relation to supply chain security and energy access, as opposed to mitigating the social and environmental harms of resource extraction. The result is a transnational governance architecture that operates primarily (and systematically) with minimal scrutiny, transparency, and accountability. For stakeholders directly affected by the latest mining boom cycle, the absence of effective and legitimate accountability mechanisms reinforces a pattern of uneven development that shifts the most destructive forms of extraction to the social and ecological margins of the global commodity frontier.","[Park, Susan] Univ Sydney, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kramarz, Teresa] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, 5 Bancroft Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; [Johnson, Craig] Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Sydney; University of Toronto; University of Guelph,"Kramarz, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, 5 Bancroft Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada.",teresa.kramarz@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,75,4,4,6,7,,,,1756-932X,1756-9338,,,,DEC,2024,34,6,,,,,754,767,,10.1002/eet.2122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eet.2122,,JUL 2024,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since 2007, many media stories have appeared about alleged negative impacts of biofuels, notably the price of food going up or land-grab by plantation developers. These stories stand in stark contrast with the rosy picture painted by some academics involved in the technical development of bioethanol or biodiesel. This paper explores the questions when and why negative social impacts are likely to occur and under what circumstances more positive impacts might be expected. These impacts are discussed for three geographically defined biofuel supply chains; north north, south north and south south. These three systems differ in the spatial scale of production and consumption and with that comes a different distribution of environmental, social and economic impacts. In the case of domestic production and consumption in developed countries, the social impacts are relatively minor and can be mitigated by social policies. Large scale, export-oriented production systems in developing countries could theoretically yield positive social impacts, but this would require on the one hand the tailored design of 'pro-poor' social innovations and interventions on the ground and on the other hand a certification of the supply chain feeding into consumer demand for 'ethical' fuel. The latent existence of this demand might be significant but recent NGO campaigns have severely undermined the ethical credentials of biofuels. It would require a persistent and collaborative effort to restore the brand value of 'green' fuel, an effort which will require better legislation and radically improved monitoring and enforcement practices in countries where the very absence of these has led to, and is still causing, the large scale destruction of habitats that are carbon sinks of global importance. The significant levels of government funding for biofuels stand in strong contrast with the problematic environmental and social governance of international biofuels supply chains. Notwithstanding the 'must tackle climate change' rhetoric by policy makers and in policy documents, this suggests that biofuels policy may be primarily driven by other concerns, especially regarding energy security. We argue that policies that are designed for a rather narrowly defined purpose of 'security of supply', cannot be realistically expected to yield high social or environmental benefits, and certainly not abroad.

Examining net-zero policy and stakeholder impact from the environmental justice viewpoint,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,Article,,,,,,Carbon neutrality; Circular economy; Stakeholder; Net-zero; SEM; Environment social and governance ESG; Survey,CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; INNOVATION; RESPONSES; SALIENCE; BARRIERS,"The circular economy is crucial in promoting environmental justice by reducing the uneven burden of environmental hazards on marginalized communities and low-income individuals. The circular economy transition is increasingly a pivotal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. Recent shifts in stakeholder focus towards carbon neutrality have made net-zero and environmental social and governance (ESG) hot topics to study, as they can lead to environmental justice. This research delves into the significance of net-zero policies and stakeholder pressure in integrating circular economy concepts into supply chains, aiming to establish a carbon-neutral supply chain within the environmental justice framework. Even though there is a lot of literature about the circular economy, not much is known about how it affects the adoption of the circular economy, the involvement of stakeholders, and net zero policy. Specifically, the role of innovation capability in this context has not been fully explored. This research aims to clarify the role of stakeholders in promoting circular economic practices in supply chains and their impact on carbon neutrality. It also examines how net-zero policies and innovation capabilities affect each other. To achieve this, we used structural equation modeling on data from 217 manufacturing firms from October 2023 to January 2024. Findings highlight a positive relationship between stakeholder pressure and circular economy integration, contributing to carbon-neutral supply chain outcomes. Results show net-zero policies moderate the stakeholder and circular economy relationship, with innovative capabilities acting as a partial mediator. This study adds to the literature by explaining the complex relationships between stakeholder pressures, circular economy practices, and the role of net zero policies and innovation capabilities in advancing carbon-neutral supply chains. This research makes a unique contribution to theory by examining the impact of circular economy practices on social well-being and environmental benefits, particularly regarding environmental justice.","[Garg, Amit; Raut, Rakesh D.; Gokhale, Ravindra S.] Indian Inst Management IIM, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, Mumbai 400087, Maharashtra, India; [Kumar, Mukesh] Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Mech Engn, Patna 800005, India; [Zhang, Chi] Kedge Business Sch, Dept Management, F-33405 Talence, France; [Kumar, Mukesh] Ganga Mem Coll Polytech, Harnaut Nalanda 803110, Bihar, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Mumbai; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Patna; Kedge Business School,"Raut, RD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management IIM, Dept Operat & Supply Chain Management, Mumbai 400087, Maharashtra, India.",rraut@iimmumbai.ac.in; kumarmukesh12mw@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,0,0,9,9,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,FEB 1,2025,491,,,,,,,,144851,10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.144851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.144851,,JAN 2025,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The existing literature lacks a theoretical framework to delineate the interrelationship between internal and external SSCF enablers. This gap leaves firms exposed to financial risks and impedes their long-term sustainability. This study addresses a gap in the literature by integrating internal competencies and external pressures as enablers in SSCF during disruptions. Employing institutional and dynamic capability theories, it identifies and analyses 45 enablers through the fuzzy Delphi method and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory. The findings emphasise the driving roles of collaboration value innovation, financial stability, and operational capacity in enabling SSCF. These aspects foster a response to disruptions, particularly in enhancing environmental, social, and governance efforts. In practice, demand forecasting, decision synchronisation, stakeholder relationships, working capital, and financial information sharing offer perspectives on enabling SSCF under disruptive conditions.","[Negash, Yeneneh Tamirat; Tseng, Ming-Lang] Asia Univ, Inst Innovat & Circular Econ, 500 Liufeng Rd, Taichung, Taiwan; [Negash, Yeneneh Tamirat; Hassan, Abdiqani Muse] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Hassan, Abdiqani Muse] Univ Hargeisa, Dept Civil Engn, Hargeysa, Somalia; [Lim, Ming K.] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Scotland; [Lim, Ming K.; Tseng, Ming-Lang] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM Grad Sch Business, Bangi, Malaysia; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] China Med Univ, China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] Khon Kaen Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] De La Salle Univ, RVDR Coll Business, Manila, Philippines",Asia University Taiwan; Asia University Taiwan; University of Glasgow; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; Khon Kaen University; De La Salle University,"Tseng, ML (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Inst Innovat & Circular Econ, 500 Liufeng Rd, Taichung, Taiwan.",tsengminglang@gmail.com,,,,,,,61,1,1,18,55,,,,1367-5567,1469-848X,,,,APR 3,2025,28,4,,,,,449,473,,10.1080/13675567.2024.2308152,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13675567.2024.2308152,,JAN 2024,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study uses data from publicly listed automotive manufacturing firms from 2009 to 2022 to examine the impact of target firms' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on total-factor productivity (TFP) at upstream and downstream firms from a supply-chain perspective. By employing a two-way, fixed-effects model, mediation analysis, and a moderation model, the study provides comprehensive insights. The findings reveal the following: (1) The ESG performance of target firms in automotive manufacturing significantly improves the TFP of downstream customers, and this conclusion is robust even when using instrumental variable methods, additional control variables, and rigorous robustness tests. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that the ESG performance of target firms alleviates the financing constraints of their customers, thereby positively impacting the customers' TFP. Additionally, the study finds that the monopolistic power of the target firm negatively moderates the relationship between its ESG performance and the TFP of its customers. These empirical findings enhance the understanding of supply-chain spillover effects and provide a new theoretical foundation for improving firms' ESG performance.","[Yang, Feng] Liaocheng Univ, Sch Business, Liaocheng 252059, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tingwei; Zhang, Zongbin] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250358, Peoples R China; [Yao, Kan] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Liaocheng University; Shandong Normal University; Shandong University,"Yao, K (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",yangfeng@lcu.edu.cn; 2021010021@sdnu.edu.cn; zhangzongbin@sdnu.edu.cn; yaokan@mail.sdu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China; [21BJL107],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences);,"This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China, grant number 21BJL107.",,61,1,1,47,47,,,,,2071-1050,,,,OCT,2024,16,20,,,,,,,9016,10.3390/su16209016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16209016,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These studies have led to valued insights into this issue, though there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms by which sustainability-related issues are materialized as risks in the supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach The paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate the sustainability risk in the supply chain management mechanism. To do so, a novel approach using the double normalization-based multiple aggregation (DNMA) approach under the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment is extended to identify, rank and evaluate the sustainability risk factors in supply chain management. Findings To provide comprehensive sustainability risk factors, this study has conducted a survey using interview and literature review. In this regard, this study identified 36 sustainability risk factors in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms in five different groups of risk, including sustainable operational risk factors, economic risk factors, environmental risk factors, social risk factors, and sustainable distribution and recycling risk factors. The results of this paper found that the poor planning and scheduling was the important sustainability risk in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms, followed by the environmental accidents, production capacity risk, product design risk and exploitative hiring policies. In addition, the results of the study found that the extended approach was effective and efficient in evaluating the sustainability risk factors in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms. Originality/value Three aggregation methods based on the normalization techniques are discussed. A DNMA method is proposed under intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). To propose a broad procedure for identifying and classifying sustainability risk factors (ESFs) in supply chain management. To rank the sustainability risk factor, the authors utilize a procedure for evaluating the significance degree of the sustainability risk factor in supply chain management.","[Wang, Lanjing] Henan Univ, Inst Modern Logist, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lanjing] Henan Univ, Sch Business, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Rani, Pratibha] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Inst Sci, Dept Math, Mohali, India",Henan University; Henan University; Chandigarh University,"Wang, LJ (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Inst Modern Logist, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.;Wang, LJ (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Business, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.",henuwlj@126.com,,,,,,,117,30,30,3,51,,,,1741-0398,1758-7409,,,,JUN 20,2022,35,4/5,,,SI,,1067,1099,,10.1108/JEIM-05-2021-0222,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEIM-05-2021-0222,,OCT 2021,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Management",,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

An analytical framework,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,,,,Article,,,,,,corporate social responsibility; eco-labeling; global governance; legitimacy; private authority,WORLD; DYNAMICS,"In the absence of effective national and intergovernmental regulation to ameliorate global environmental and social problems, private alternatives have proliferated, including self-regulation, corporate social responsibility, and public-private partnerships. Of the alternatives, non-state market driven (NSMD) governance systems deserve greater attention because they offer the strongest regulation and potential to socially embed global markets. NSMD systems encourage compliance by recognizing and tracking, along the market's supply chain, responsibly produced goods and services. They aim to establish political legitimacy whereby firms, social actors, and stakeholders are united into a community that accepts shared rule as appropriate and justified. Drawing inductively on evidence from a range of NSMD systems, and deductively on theories of institutions and learning, we develop an analytical framework and a preliminary set of causal propositions to explicate whether and how political legitimacy might be achieved. The framework corrects the existing literature's inattention to the conditioning effects of global social structure, and its tendency to treat actor evaluations of NSMD systems as static and strategic. It identifies a three-phase process through which NSMD systems might gain political legitimacy. It posits that a logic of consequences alone cannot explain actor evaluations: the explanation requires greater reference to a logic of appropriateness as systems progress through the phases. The framework aims to guide future empirical work to assess the potential of NSMD systems to socially embed global markets.","[Bernstein, Steven] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Cashore, Benjamin] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Program Forest Policy & Governance, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of Toronto; Yale University,"Bernstein, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",steven.bernstein@utoronto.ca; Benjamin.Cashore@yale.edu,,,,,,,66,497,546,2,221,,,,1748-5983,1748-5991,,,,DEC,2007,1,4,,,,,347,371,,10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00021.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00021.x,,,,Law; Political Science; Public Administration,,Government & Law; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

From the resource dependence perspective, this work presents a novel conceptual model to investigate the influence of political and social power on channel power restructuring and induced green supply chain collaboration in brander-retailer bidirectional green supply chains of fashionable consumer electronics products (FCEPs). An FCEP refers to the consumer electronics product (e.g., personal computers, mobile phones, computer notebooks, and game consoles) with the features of a well-known brand associated, a short product lifecycle, timely and fashionable design fit for market trends, and quick responsiveness to the variations of market demands. The proposed model is tested empirically using questionnaire data obtained from retailers in the FCEP brander-retailer distribution channels. Analytical results reveal that as an extension of political and social power, TPPI positively affects the reciprocal interdependence of dyadic members and reduces power asymmetry, thereby enhancing the collaborative relationship of dyadic members and leading to improved green supply chain performance. Therein, reciprocal interdependence underlying collaborative relationship is the key to reducing the external environmental uncertainties in the TPPI context.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Sheu, JB (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Business Adm, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",jbsheu@ntu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 100-2628-H-002-138-MY4, NSC 102-2410-H-002-166-MY3]","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research is supported by grants NSC 100-2628-H-002-138-MY4 and NSC 102-2410-H-002-166-MY3 from the National Science Council of Taiwan.

Drawing on thousands of audits conducted by a major social auditor, the authors identify structural contingencies in the institutional environment and program design under which codes and monitoring are more likely to be associated with improvements in conditions. At the institutional level, suppliers improve more when they face greater risk that nongovernmental organizations and the press will expose harmful working conditions. They also improve more when their buyers have experienced negative publicity for supply chain labor abuses. At the program design level, suppliers improve more on average when audits are pre-announced, when auditors are highly trained, and especially when both elements are present. Extended analysis of variations across violation types reveals nuances to these findings. For instance, pre-announced audits were followed by greater improvement in occupational safety and health practices but not child labor practices. These findings can inform strategies for improving supply chain working conditions.","[Short, Jodi L.] UC Hastings Coll Law, Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA; [Toffel, Michael W.] Harvard Sch Business, Environm Management, Boston, MA USA; [Hugill, Andrea R.] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Harvard University; Georgetown University,"Short, JL (corresponding author), UC Hastings Coll Law, Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA.",shortj@uchastings.edu,,,Harvard Business School's Division of Research and Faculty Development,Harvard Business School's Division of Research and Faculty Development,"We gratefully acknowledge the research assistance provided by Melissa Ouellet as well as by Chris Allen, John Galvin, Erika McCaffrey, and Christine Rivera.

Growing demand drives high wood extraction rates over increasing areas of miombo and mopane woodlands. Charcoal production can lead to changes in ecosystem service provision and woodland degradation while also significantly contributing to rural income and, possibly, poverty alleviation. As such, understanding charcoal production and trade has important implications for rural areas and for the sustainable development of woodland resources. Here, we investigate charcoal production and trade through empirical research conducted in Gaza Province, the main charcoal supply area for Maputo, Mozambique. We analyse the present structure of the main charcoal supply chains from Gaza province to Maputo and the profit distribution along them. Seven villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza, at different stages of engagement with the charcoal industry, were selected for investigation. We conducted household surveys and semi-structured interviews with key informants (village leaders, charcoal producers, licence holders, wholesalers, transporters and forest technicians), from May to October 2014. Our results highlight two main charcoal supply chains comprising four main actor groups a) Local small-scale operators producing charcoal on a small-scale with household labour, who sell to wholesalers b) Large-scale operators producing and commercialising large volumes of charcoal using migrant labour, who sell their own production to wholesalers. While charcoal production constitutes an important income source for rural households in Mabalane, under supply chain a) more than 90% of the monetary benefits do not reach local communities and remain with external agents. Two of the main factors impeding the generation of greater revenues at community level are: 1) bureaucratic burdens in obtaining charcoal commercialisation rights in the form of licences; and 2) weak institutional capacities for woodland resource governance. We conclude that access to markets and control over woodlands is key if local communities are to generate greater benefits from charcoal production while aiming at sustainable charcoal production. Strong local institutions for obtaining commercialisation rights and managing woodland resources have to be developed, while the restructuring of the licencing systemin favour of small-scale producers and more rigorous control of the regulations could support this process.

Green growth not only protects the environment and human beings but also serves as a substitute for scarce natural assets. Governance institutions develop laws and policies for all industries in a country and are directly responsible for natural resource exploration and environmental protection or destruction. Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to environmental hazards in the world. To address this issue, this study is the first to analyze the relations among governance indicators, ISO 14001 and green growth in Pakistan by using time-series data from 2000 to 2017. The study utilized advanced mathematical Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) models, namely, absolute grey relational grade (GRG), Deng's GRG, and Second Synthetic Degree of Grey Incidence Analysis (SSGIG) models, to capture the relations among the studied variables. The main results revealed that ISO 14001, with the highest GRA values of 0.8-0.9, proved to be effective in channeling green growth. Among all governance indicators related to green growth, the rule of law with the highest maximin criterion value of 0.644 was found to play a key role for Pakistan. The study findings provide insights into how good governance can contribute to accomplishing the objectives of environmental sustainability. They can also help legislators and organizations understand the importance of ISO 14001 certification to promote sustainable practices across sectors in Pakistan.

In addition, buying firms cannot optimize the performance of the whole supply chain because the supplier sustainability practices are unobservable to them and to the public. These two challenges lead to the occurrence of several environmental and social scandals. These scandals pose serious economic and reputational consequences to supply chain members, especially buying firms. Given these challenges and using a sequential game-theoretic methodology, our contribution to the literature on supplier sustainability is to address the effects of supplier code of conduct (SCC) programs on different performance indicators of supply chains. Our analyses indicated that (a) an SCC program can mitigate the supply chain performance deficiencies created by the lack of the integrated optimization of the whole supply chain. Moreover, an SCC program can be superior to some common auditing programs initiated by buying firms. (b) In cases that the supplier's capability is low or moderate, an SCC program provides a Pareto improvement in its sustainability level and the buying firm's profit. (c) High consumer awareness threatens the buying firm's survival in the market. Given this threat, an SCC program indirectly enhances the buying firm's potential to survive. (d) Buying firms should lower their suppliers' wholesale prices in exchange for a substantial investment in their suppliers' capabilities, irrespective of whether or not an SCC program is initiated.","[Zarei, Hamid; Rasti-Barzoki, Morteza] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran",Isfahan University of Technology,"Zarei, H (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Esfahan 8415683111, Iran.",hamid.zarei@in.iut.ac.ir,,,,,,,78,3,3,0,20,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,MAY,2022,29,25,,,,,37748,37764,,10.1007/s11356-021-18073-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18073-2,,JAN 2022,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This issue is particularly relevant in industrial contexts where the supply chains are complex in terms of structure and number of players, such as the construction industry. Thus, the aim of the paper is to explore the sustainability practices adopted in the construction industry, with a particular attention to the role of environmental collaboration of supply chain partners in achieving sustainability. By means of multiple case study-based research, we investigate sustainability practices on a sample of construction companies of Italy, thus identifying three main sustainability approaches, which differ in both the strategic orientation towards sustainability and the level of implementation in design, purchasing, and governance processes, as well as the main variables driving the adoption of these approaches.","[Pero, Margherita; Moretto, Antonella] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Piazza Leonardo Da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bottani, Eleonora; Bigliardi, Barbara] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Ingn & Architettura, Viale Sci 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Parma,"Bottani, E (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Ingn & Architettura, Viale Sci 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.",margherita.pero@polimi.it; antonella.moretto@polimi.it; eleonora.bottani@unipr.it; barbara.bigliardi@unipr.it,,,"Italian Ministry of University and Research [D92115000210008, 197]","Italian Ministry of University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This research was supported by the research grant No. D92115000210008, called ESCALATE-Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Supply Chain and Logistics with Advanced Technologies, funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the SIR-Scientific Independence of young Researchers 2014 program (decree of 23 January 2014, No. 197).",,107,62,66,4,47,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JAN,2017,9,1,,,,,,,125,10.3390/su9010125,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9010125,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, questions have been raised about their ability to regulate the social and environmental performance of mining and battery manufacturers. This article provides a critical reflection on the new EU legislation, focusing primarily on the upstream end of extraction for global battery and electric vehicle production. We make three claims: first that the EU's battery regulations represent a partial hardening of transnational supply chain governance that allows companies to undertake their own due diligence by outsourcing reporting and verification obligations to third-party auditors; second that the regulations prioritize issues that reflect EU interests, as opposed to communities affected by the recent surge in demand for battery metals; and third, that the regulations are embedded in a wider economic and geopolitical conflict that tends to disfavour producer states.","[Johnson, Craig A.; Khosravani, Jonathan] Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W9, Canada",University of Guelph,"Johnson, CA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Polit Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W9, Canada.",cjohns06@uoguelph.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2021-0235],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors wish to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on previous drafts.

As many unsustainable and unethical activities are hidden in the upstream supply chain, it demands ESG reporting on suppliers. Against this background, buyers conduct due diligence (DD) to assess, manage, and report the ESG practices of the upstream suppliers. We consider two buyers with different responsible awareness competing for consumers in the end market (referred to as a strong buyer and a weak buyer). Competing buyers can share a common supplier and cooperate in implementing ESG DD to strengthen consumer trust, nevertheless, such cooperation gives the weak buyer an opportunity to free ride on the strong buyer's ESG effort (i.e., ESG effort spillover). We find that only a significantly low spillover effect can induce a fair-neutral strong buyer to adopt buyer collaboration. Interestingly, with the consideration of fairness concerns, the competitor can be treated as a friend in collaboratively managing the ESG practices of the common supplier even facing a great threat of ESG DD effort spillover. Our results also reveal that fairness concerns have a non-monotone impact on the possibility of realizing a win-win outcome between the two buyers. Our findings shed light on how the optimal supplier ESG DD strategy in a competing market differs when incorporating fairness concerns.","[Cao, Yifan; Li, Qingying; Shen, Bin] Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yulan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Shen, B (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",binshen@dhu.edu.cn,,,"Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [23AZD030]; National Science Foundation of China [72271050, 72371068, 71832001]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (RGC) [15505019]",Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (RGC)(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"We sincerely thank the editor and three reviewers for helpful and constructive comments.

This ambivalence is a result of an empirical focus on the effects of these programs on target communities, as opposed to an empirical focus on the people who are responsible for developing those programs. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork among people tasked with designing, promoting, and enforcing sustainability standards in global agricultural supply chains, I argue that the empowerment of multinational corporations and well-funded environmental NGOs that characterizes market-oriented sustainability programs is, in fact, intentional. This intention reflects the belief among sustainability professionals that the intersection of western scientific expertise with the dynamics of the market is the most effective way to promote sustainability in global supply chains, and to generate global sustainability in a more general sense. Concepts like stakeholder engagement and a commitment to flexibility and accommodation in the development and adoption of social and environmental standards are examples of what I call euphemistic sustainability, which shifts critical attention away from a balance of power that is increasingly tilted toward private interests, even as that imbalance remains an intended outcome of non-state market-driven governance systems like ostensibly voluntary sustainability standards.","[Archer, Matthew] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Archer, M (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mbarcher@protonmail.com,,,Danish Independent Research Fund [7023-00115AB],Danish Independent Research Fund,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this article was funded by the Danish Independent Research Fund (Grant Number 7023-00115AB).",,55,7,7,1,11,,,,2514-8486,2514-8494,,,,JUN,2022,5,2,,,,,881,900,,10.1177/25148486211014505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/25148486211014505,,,,Environmental Studies; Geography,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in a buyer-supplier relationship, how the asymmetric market power between a firm and its partners affects the firm financial performance remains an open question. This study investigates the impact of market power discrepancy (MPD) between a focal firm and its supply chain partners on the focal firm's financial performance, as measured by return on assets (ROA). With empirical evidence from China's listed firms between 2001 and 2021, we find that a higher MPD between the firm and its supplier or the firm and its customer negatively affects the firm's financial performance. A supplier or customer that has a matched market power with the firm is the best candidate for building a relationship. In addition, our findings suggest that the strength of the buyer-supplier relationship amplifies the negative impact of MPD on the firm's financial performance, whereas the level of relationship embeddedness reduces the MPD's negative effect. Moreover, our findings suggest that firm-specific institutional, industry, and regional economic heterogeneities affect the MPD's financial impact. Further, we find that MPD not only negatively affects a firm's financial performance but also worsens its environmental, social, and corporate governance performance. Our study recommends that firms should alleviate the asymmetry of market power with their partners and leverage the relationship dependence to balance power and benefits.","[Gu, Jing] Sichuan Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Finance, 24 South Sect,First Ring Rd, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xinyu; Wang, Junyao] Sichuan Univ, Coll Econ, 24 South Sect,First Ring Rd, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xun] Calif State Univ, Coll Business Adm & Publ Policy, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Dominguez Hills,1000 Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA",Sichuan University; Sichuan University,"Xu, X (corresponding author), Calif State Univ, Coll Business Adm & Publ Policy, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Dominguez Hills,1000 Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",xinyushi@stu.scu.edu.cn; junyao@stu.scu.edu.cn; xunxu@csudh.edu,,,"National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [72232002]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [21XJA790002]; Sichuan University [SKSYL2022-06, 2022CX12]","National Natural Science Founda-tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Sichuan University(Sichuan University)","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (Grant No. 72232002) , the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 21XJA790002) , and Sichuan University (Grant Nos.

Our approach relied on scrutinizing two of the most used compulsory certification templates which are enforced by major buyers to their suppliers in order to assure responsible activity in the farmed fish chain (GlobalG.A.P. certification scheme) and in the wild-captured fish chain (Marine Stewardship Council-MSC). Since fish may experience intense suffering in regular activities involved in catching, maintenance, transport and management, we analyzed whether those instruments can contribute to improve the welfare of fish. Although positive outcomes may be expected in aquaculture production, serious welfare issues regarding wild-capture fish are brought to the fore and preliminary action is proposed. We present recommendations for improving the positive impacts of such certification schemes in GVCs and argue that sustainability-driven standards (MSC) could also embrace more AW-focused criteria in order to contribute with reducing unnecessary animal suffering in the fish chain.","[Reis, Germano Glufke] Univ Fed Parana, Business Management Sch, Av Lothario Meissner 632, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Maiolino Molento, Carla Forte; Oliveira Souza, Ana Paula] Univ Fed Parana, Anim Welf Lab, Rua Funcionarios 1540, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Reis, GG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Business Management Sch, Av Lothario Meissner 632, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",glufkereis@ufpr.br; carlamolento@ufpr.br; anapaulasouza.mv@gmail.com,,,,,,,83,2,3,2,18,,,,1187-7863,1573-322X,,,,OCT,2021,34,5,,,,,,,30,10.1007/s10806-021-09870-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-021-09870-3,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Ethics; Environmental Sciences; History & Philosophy Of Science",,Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; History & Philosophy of Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the ways in which IM enhances environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance, along with its potential mechanisms, remain unexplored. This study employs a two-way fixed-effects model with panel data from 4417 Chinese listed firms spanning the period 2009-2022 to examine these relationships. It is found that IM significantly improves corporate ESG performance. Robustness tests confirm the reliability of these results, and mechanism analysis highlights the mediating effects of information transparency, green technology innovation, and supply chain collaborative innovation. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that IM has a notably stronger effect in high-carbon-emission sectors, state-owned enterprises, and high-tech industries. This suggests that policymakers should design differentiated policies based on industry and firm characteristics to promote the adoption of IM and foster sustainable development strategies. This research contributes to expanding the theoretical understanding of how IM affects ESG while also providing empirical evidence for enterprises and governments to promote green transformation.","[Huang, Hui] Fujian Normal Univ, Concord Univ Coll, Dept Econ & Law, Fuzhou 350117, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jing] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350001, Peoples R China; [Ren, Changman] Ningde Normal Univ, Sch Business Management, Ningde 352000, Peoples R China",Fujian Normal University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Ningde Normal University,"Ren, CM (corresponding author), Ningde Normal Univ, Sch Business Management, Ningde 352000, Peoples R China.",huihuangchris@gmail.com; blackbear_yang@163.com; renchangman1987@126.com,,,,,,,104,2,2,28,28,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2024,16,23,,,,,,,10724,10.3390/su162310724,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162310724,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Efforts to systematically address the emerging sustainability issues associated with critical minerals have been challenged by complex mineral supply chains, and the distal and geographically dispersed nature of social-ecological impacts from mineral extraction and processing and eventual use. In this review, we apply a bibliometric analysis of the literature in the 2010-2020 period to analyze the state of research on the issues of critical mineral extraction impacts and the global governance responses. We use the concept of telecoupling to structure our literature search and analysis across four themes: (a) critical minerals global trade and supply chain, (b) sustainability and resource policy and governance, (c) mining corporate social responsibility, and (d) information feedback and public discourse. We find a growing attention to the social-ecological implications of critical mineral extraction, but also fragmentation among thematic domains that could impede progress towards more coordinated system governance.

Because of increasing public awareness and non-governmental organization (NGO) campaigns, seafood buyers have made various commitments to improve the sustainability of their wild seafood sourcing. As part of this effort, seafood suppliers have developed their own CSR programs in order to meet buyers' sourcing requirements. However, the CSR of these companies, many of which are mid-supply chain or vertically integrated, remain largely invisible and unstudied. In order to better understand how mid-chain seafood suppliers engage in sustainability efforts, we reviewed the CSR practices of the 25 largest seafood companies globally (by revenue) that deal with wild seafood products. Based on literature, existing frameworks, and initial data analysis, we developed a structured framework to identify and categorize practices based on the issues addressed and the approach used. We found companies implement CSR to address four key areas, and through various activities that fit into five categories: Power; Practices; Partnerships; Public policy; and Philanthropy. One of the biggest gaps identified in this study is the lack of accountability mechanisms, as well as robust and consistent accounting of impacts. Indeed, many companies express commitments without clear goals and structures in place to ensure implementation. Therefore, improvements in seafood company performance on social and environmental aspects may not only require creating a better business case for CSR, but also require ensuring that companies have the necessary processes and structures in place through public oversights and regulations.","[Packer, Helen; Bailey, Megan] Dalhousie Univ, Marine Affairs Program, Fac Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Packer, Helen] Anova Food USA, 280 10th Ave, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Swartz, Wilf] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Swartz, Wilf; Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ British Columbia, Nippon Fdn, Nereus Program, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Dalhousie University; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Packer, H (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Marine Affairs Program, Fac Sci, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.;Packer, H (corresponding author), Anova Food USA, 280 10th Ave, San Diego, CA 92101 USA.",helen.packer@dal.ca; w.swartz@oceans.ubc.ca; yoshitakaota@me.com; megan.bailey@dal.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada through the NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean System Science and Technology (TOSST) grant,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada through the NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean System Science and Technology (TOSST) grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Canada provided funding for this project, in particular to H.P. through the NSERC CREATE Transatlantic Ocean System Science and Technology (TOSST) grant.",,96,27,29,3,45,,,,,2071-1050,,,,APR 2,2019,11,8,,,,,,,2254,10.3390/su11082254,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11082254,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is highlighting the fragility of globalised food distribution systems, and there is a need to focus on alternatives. This manuscript assesses the sustainability of two largely opposing marketing alternatives, namely Territorial Short Food Supply Chains (TSFSCs) and Large-Scale Food Distribution (LSFD). Specifically, the cases of Bogota (Colombia) and Cordoba (Spain) are analysed, where the development of TSFSCs has very significant in recent years but which are of a very different nature. For this purpose, a multi-criteria model based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP) methodology has been developed, considering multiple economic, social and environmental criteria. The model has been evaluated by four interest groups. The results show that the social sub-criterion - distribution of added value - is highly prioritised, and that the TSFSCs are the most sustainable alternatives globally in both cities. In Bogota, direct sales (farmers market) are prioritised, whilst in Cordoba, chain with a local retail (specialised shops). The contribution of TSFSCs to ecosystem services, equity, territorial cohesion and the revitalisation of the economy is highlighted. By interest groups, civil society, academia and public administration prioritise TSFSCs. However, the market players in Cordoba prioritise LSFD with national product. The results indicate that TSFSCs have the potential to contribute to the consolidation of sustainable and resilient food systems.","[Reina-Usuga, Liliana] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ & Business Management, Campus Ejido,POB 29016, Malaga, Spain; [Parra-Lopez, Carlos; Carmona-Torres, Carmen] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res & Training IFAPA, Ctr Camino Purchil, Dept Agrifood Syst Econ, POB 2027, Granada 18080, Spain; [de Haro-Gimenez, Tomas] Univ Cordoba, Dept Econ Sociol & Agr Policy, Campus Rabanales,POB 14071, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Cordoba,"Reina-Usuga, L (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Dept Econ & Business Management, Campus Ejido,POB 29016, Malaga, Spain.",liliana.reina@uma.es,,,,,,,80,9,9,2,23,,,,0264-8377,1873-5754,,,,MAR,2023,126,,,,,,,,106529,10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106529,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106529,,DEC 2022,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the rising global SC failure costs and risks associated with this initiative (owing to unique geopolitical, economic and mega-connectivity involving over 70 countries) necessitate examining BRI SC risks. Yet, research on the subject remains limited, and the purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: A two-pronged approach was taken. First, a data sample of 554 articles was analyzed and 178 articles found relevant were used to present a systematic, structured framework of risk factors along operational, economic, financial, social and security dimensions. Then informed by the theory of risk management and supplemented by literature evidence, we have built a BRI SC risk model. Findings: The results presented through the model show that BRI SCs face a combination of risks triggered by operational processes, informational and environmental (PIE) deficiencies. Findings show that lack of risk and liability management, unbalanced risk-sharing partnerships, lack of transparency, inadequate project evaluation, incompatible corporate governance structures and cyber security all pose threats to BRI SCs specifically and SCs in general. Research limitations/implications: Academically, the results facilitate theory development by identifying and proposing seven risk factors and modeling relationship among them and BRI SC risks outcome. The results also extend application of theory of risk management to SC context. Practical implications: The findings provide a decision-making tool for managers to assess risk factors in their SCs, thus enabling improved decision making to avoid, mitigate, transfer or accept risks. Originality/value: Identifies and proposes a set of seven risk factors that drive BRI SC risks. Develops a model of BRI SC risks which help build theory of SC risk management.","[Ram, Jiwat] La Rochelle Business Sch, Excelia Grp, La Rochelle, France; [Zhang, Zeyang] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Ram, J (corresponding author), La Rochelle Business Sch, Excelia Grp, La Rochelle, France.",jiwat.ram@gmail.com; zeyang.zhang.17@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,18,18,5,77,,,,0957-4093,1758-6550,,,,OCT 12,2020,31,4,,,,,777,799,,10.1108/IJLM-12-2019-0366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-12-2019-0366,,SEP 2020,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, there has been a surge of efforts to 'scale-up' sustainability impacts through governance interventions at landscape and jurisdictional scales. While these ambitious, scaled-up approaches are attracting significant interest, such approaches demand substantial changes to established repertoires of policy interventions and associated understandings of the pathways through which these contribute to sustainability outcomes. Drawing theoretical insights from scholarship on multi-stakeholder sustainability governance together with findings from a qualitative study of jurisdictional governance experiments in the Indonesian palm oil sector, this paper explores how emerging jurisdictional initiatives are promoting change pathways towards more sustainable commodity production, and how the political, environmental governance and economic contexts in which these interventions are implemented influence these pathways. Analysis shows that by integrating a distinctive mix of market and policydriven interventions, jurisdictional approaches are contributing to three core pathways of change, centred respectively on network and coalition-building, collaborative governance, and resource mobilisation. However, which of these pathways are most influential, how interventions are sequenced and operationalised, and how the pathways interact in shaping change is highly sensitive to varied subnational implementation contexts, with important implications for the impact and resilience of jurisdictional programs. These findings highlight the need for jurisdictional policy interventions to respond flexibly to contextually-variable configurations of actor interests, coalitions and power relations within contested multi-scalar processes of sustainable commodity governance.","[Bahruddin] Univ Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; [Macdonald, Kate; Diprose, Rachael] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pugley, Deborah Delgado] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru",Gadjah Mada University; University of Melbourne; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Macdonald, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",kmac@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council; Faculty of Social and Political Sciences Universitas Gadjah Mada (International Research Grant 2021); [FT190100736],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Faculty of Social and Political Sciences Universitas Gadjah Mada (International Research Grant 2021);,"The authors extend thanks and acknowledgements to all members of the wider research team in the Beyond Certification research project for their valuable insights and discussions, including Paul Cisneros, Annisa Hartoto, Damaris Herrera Salazar, Anke Kaulard, Nanang Kurniawan, Cristhian Parrado Rodriguez and Poppy Winanti.

Following this, we design a tripartite evolutionary game model, comprising the national government, local government, and recycler. We analyze the system stability strategies and conditions, and investigate the impact of pertinent factors on the behavior strategies of each subject. The findings reveal that adjusting the intensity of actions by both the national and local governments can significantly impact the time required for system stability, with changes in the regulatory intensity of the national government proving more effective. Active public participation emerges as a critical means to prompt proactive environmental measures by the local government and recycler. Intriguingly, increased public participation may drive the national government to opt for stricter regulatory strategies. Regarding the allocation ratio of special governance funds, an optimal value exists, and the local government can choose different ratios based on distinct objectives. In conclusion, to augment effective WEEE recycling management under environmental regulation, we make several recommendations. These include adjusting the allocation ratio of special governance funds and optimizing the penalty mechanism.","[Zhong, Yongguang] Qingdao Univ, Sch Business, 62 Kedazhi Rd, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Qingdao University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Zhong, YG (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Sch Business, 62 Kedazhi Rd, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",2021010162@qdu.edu.cn; JingAi.Ma@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; zhongyongguang@qdu.edu.cn; zhangjiaxin@qdu.edu.cn; surui2011@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974104]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Min-istry of Education of China [24YJA630140],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Min-istry of Education of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71974104) , and Humanities and Social Science Fund of Min-istry of Education of China (24YJA630140) .",,71,0,0,11,11,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,DEC 15,2024,484,,,,,,,,144327,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144327,,DEC 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet critics have cautioned against excessive reliance on individualised accountabilities as means of tackling planetary crises, given the constrained ability of such approaches to lead the large-scale transformations required to redirect anthropogenic drivers of global environmental change. This article adapts agent-centered approaches to accountability to address such critiques. It is first argued that agent-centered accountability is an important element in broader efforts to support systemic change, helping to identify responsible powerholders, redefine normative standards of responsibility and empower advocates of strengthened global environmental governance to demand compliance with expanded responsibilities. However to take seriously the distinctive demands of large-scale institutional change, such approaches need to be: (a) differentiated in ways that account for the contrasting roles of different individual and organisational actors within de-centred accountability systems; (b) materially extended in ways that enable agents to be held more effectively to account for their contributions to collective social and political processes; and (c) discursively challenged in ways that resist discursive efforts to present individualised accountabilities as substitutes for more radical and large-scale institutional interventions. The article's argument is elaborated and illustrated through exploration of problems and practices of accountability associated with the contested governance of global production systems.","[Macdonald, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Macdonald, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",kmac@unimelb.edu.au,,,"Open access publishing facilitated by The University of Melbourne, as part of the Wiley - The University of Melbourne agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.; University of Melbourne, as part of the Wiley - The University of Melbourne agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians","Open access publishing facilitated by The University of Melbourne, as part of the Wiley - The University of Melbourne agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.; University of Melbourne, as part of the Wiley - The University of Melbourne agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians","Open access publishing facilitated by The University of Melbourne, as part of the Wiley - The University of Melbourne agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.",,91,3,3,0,3,,,,1756-932X,1756-9338,,,,DEC,2023,33,6,,,SI,,604,614,,10.1002/eet.2084,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eet.2084,,NOV 2023,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With strategic autonomy and responsible sourcing high on the political agenda these risks are especially relevant for the EU. This paper proposes an approach to conduct risk-based due diligence. Using a trade-linked material flow analysis, ESG and dependency hotspots along supply chains can be identified. Silver supply chains for photo-voltaics (PV) are taken as case-study. The model traces silver from mining to PV module manufacturing, from 1995 to 2021. The supply of silver powder, paste, PV cells, and modules is found to be highly concentrated. These supply chains are linked to substantial ESG risks, mostly nested in fabrication and manufacturing, some of which have worsened over time. Over 87% of the silver used in PV transits through at least one country with a very high risk factor. Reshoring the PV industry to the EU can partially de-risk supply.","[Gervais, Estelle; Nold, Sebastian] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst ISE, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Gervais, Estelle; Kleijn, Rene; van der Voet, Ester] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Germany; Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy Systems; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Gervais, E (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst ISE, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.;Gervais, E (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands.",estelle.gervais@ise.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,43,8,8,18,72,,,,0921-3449,1879-0658,,,,NOV,2023,198,,,,,,,,107148,10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107148,,AUG 2023,,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the Brazilian Amazon, these policies take the form of market exclusion mechanisms, i.e., immediately dropping suppliers who have cleared their land after a specific cut-off date. Theory suggests that strict exclusionary policies such as these are likely to result in both negative livelihood effects and reduced effectiveness of the policy if some farmers are not able to comply. It is proposed that a more cooperative model of enforcement that uses flexible and negotiated approaches to compliance management may enable more marginal and disadvantaged farmers to achieve compliance, thereby improving both the effectiveness of supply chain policies and their equity. Through our case study of cattle in the Brazilian Amazon, we examine the degree to which a purportedly cooperative supply chain policy exhibits coercive tendencies at different tiers and the degree to which these tendencies influence effectiveness and equity outcomes of the policy. We show that, surprisingly, even cooperative models of enforcement are prone to exhibit coercive tendencies in multi-tier supply chains, leading to severe equity shortcomings. We provide recommendations and a research agenda to mitigate effectiveness-equity tradeoffs in multi-tier, forest-focused supply chain policies in the aim to improve the design, adoption, and implementation of such policies.","[Cammelli, Federico; Levy, Samuel A.; Grabs, Janina; Garrett, Rachael D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Valentim, Judson Ferreira] Embrapa Acre, Rodovia BR-364,km 14,Caixa Postal 321, BR-69908970 Rio Branco, SC, Brazil; [Grabs, Janina] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); EMBRAPA Acre; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Cammelli, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",federico.cammelli@gess.ethz.ch,,,"SNF [100017_192373]; ERC [949932]; World Food System Center of ETH Zurich; National Science Foundation [1739253]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100017_192373] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1739253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [949932] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","SNF; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); World Food System Center of ETH Zurich; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","Funding JG, FC, and SL were supported by startup funds provided to RG through ETH Zuerich; in addition, JG was supported by SNF Grant #100017_192373; FC was supported by ERC Grant #949932 and the World Food System Center of ETH Zurich; and SL was supported by National Science Foundation award #1739253.",,103,18,18,1,8,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 15,2022,332,,,,,,,,130031,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130031,,,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the seafood supply system is facing multiple contemporary global challenges that threaten its resilience as well as food security, livelihoods and ecological wellbeing. This opinion piece discusses the drivers of transformative change impacting seafood supply chains, with a particular focus on the UK, but the strategies described can be applied to many similarly developed countries. To address the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, escalating energy costs, climate change, risk management processes, and to ensure food security and resilience, active policy interventions are needed. Three key policy actions that policymakers can focus on are (i) sustainable seafood models, such as regenerative seafood systems and the circular economy, to improve both environmental and human health outcomes and the likelihood of meeting Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) promote local seafood as part of national food security to strengthen supply chains, support local communities, and enhance traceability and transparency; and, (iii) promote diversification in seafood sourcing and distribution to reduce pressure on critical stocks and increase the flexibility of food systems, while ensuring social and ecological protection.

Hierarchical linear regressions are applied to test the proposed model and hypotheses. Findings Partner, governance, and functional alliance portfolio diversities have a U-shaped, inverted U-shaped, and positive linear effect, respectively, on sustainability collaboration. Sustainability collaboration is in turn found to enhance the SSCM performances in terms of economic, environmental, and social. Originality/value This research introduced a new theoretical lens, CEM, to the SSCM field. It also provided findings that can help firms to manage their alliance portfolios more dynamically in terms of the nature and diversity level of the portfolio and in a way that adds to the triple bottom line through the mediating effect of sustainability collaboration.","[Le, Angelina Nhat Hanh; Nguyen, Tessa Tien] Univ Econ, Sch Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Tessa Tien; Cheng, Julian Ming-Sung] Natl Cent Univ, Management Sch, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics; National Central University,"Cheng, JMS (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Management Sch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",hanhln@ueh.edu.vn; tessanguyen0202@gmail.com; mingsungcheng@yahoo.com,,,Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [109-2410-H-008 -032]; Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) [502.02-2020.30],Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST); Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED)(National Foundation for Science & Technology Development (NAFOSTED)),"This research is funded by Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) under grant number 109-2410-H-008 -032, and Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 502.02-2020.30.",,84,14,14,6,95,,,,0144-3577,1758-6593,,,,OCT 22,2021,41,10,,,,,1593,1614,,10.1108/IJOPM-08-2020-0505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-08-2020-0505,,SEP 2021,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While CSR 'codes of conduct' are easy to draft, supplier compliance has been elusive. Even third-party monitoring has proven an incomplete solution. This article proposes that an alteration in the supply chain's governance, from an arms-length market model to a collaborative partnership, often will be necessary to effectuate CSR. The market model forces contractors to focus on price and delivery as they compete for the lead firm's business, rendering CSR observance secondary, at best. A collaborative partnership where the lead firm gives select suppliers secure product orders and other benefits removes disincentives and adds incentives for CSR compliance. In time, the suppliers' CSR habit should shift their business philosophy toward pursuing CSR as an end in itself, regardless of buyer incentives and monitoring. This article examines these hypotheses in the context of the athletic footwear sector with Nike, Inc. and its suppliers as the specific case study. The data collected and conclusions reached offer strategies for advancing CSR beyond the superficial and often ineffectual 'code of conduct' stage.","[Lim, Suk-Jun] Dong A Univ, Pusan, South Korea; [Phillips, Joe] Dongseo Univ, Pusan 617716, South Korea",Dong A University; Dongseo University,"Lim, SJ (corresponding author), Dong A Univ, Dongdaeshin Dong, Pusan, South Korea.",sjlim@dau.ac.kr; joephillips5@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,122,136,0,97,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,AUG,2008,81,1,,,,,143,156,,10.1007/s10551-007-9485-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-007-9485-2,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article, the authors discuss the pressures on companies to disclose supply chain information, the drivers and impediments to such disclosure, and the types of supply chain information typically made available to the public. The article identifies the broad disclosure strategies companies can use to release supply chain information and offers managers guidance on designing the optimal disclosure strategy for their company. In addition to exploring the topic with examples from companies including Nike Inc., WD-40, and Patagonia Inc., the authors take a detailed look at how Apple's approach to supply chain disclosure has evolved since 2009. In considering how to manage supply chain information disclosure, the authors argue that managers must appreciate the diverse forces and actors driving and enabling this trend. Aside from internal governance and risk concerns, external pressure has come from government regulations, best practices of peers, changing expectations from salient stakeholder groups, and, of course, external events (such as the 2013 Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh). The authors note that improving transparency can be expensive. The lack of standardized reporting systems, the absence of a common technology platform, ill-defined standards, and a lack of supplier education can also pose serious hindrances to companies wishing to improve their supply chain transparency. The authors identify four common types of supply chain information that tends to be publicly disclosed: supply chain membership, provenance of materials, environmental information, and information on social impacts such as working conditions. Based on their research, they developed a transparency matrix to frame four typical supply chain disclosure strategies: transparent, secret, distracting, and withheld. The authors say managers must understand the demands and respond in creative and meaningful ways without undermining the competitive advantage of their company. The tools and advice presented in the article can help managers navigate this complex and evolving area.","[Marshall, Donna] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland; [McCarthy, Lucy] Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Harrigan, Fiona] UCD Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Marshall, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Business Sch, Dublin, Ireland.",smrfeedback@mit.edu,,,Irish Research Council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",The authors would like to acknowledge the support and generous funding of the Irish Research Council.,,12,67,72,3,378,,,,1532-9194,,,,,WIN,2016,57,2,,,,,37,+,,,,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We posit five hypotheses to check the relations binding ESG scores and the total sustainability performances of firms. A Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis and standard bootstrapping using Smart PLS 3.0 software is used to observe the results and to evidence the direct and moderating effects among latent variables contributing to sustainability performances. We observe a significant and negative moderating effect of ESG performances, independently over the all direct relations, considering their relationship to ESG performances.

The aim of this study was to use a value chain framework to characterize the broiler chicken meat system of Nairobi, its governance and sanitary risks. A total of 4 focus groups and 8 key informant interviews were used to collect cross-sectional data from: small-scale broiler farmers in selected Nairobi peri-urban and informal settlement areas; medium to large integrated broiler production companies; traders and meat inspectors in live chicken and chicken meat markets in Nairobi. Qualitative data were collected on types of people operating in the system, their interactions, sanitary measures in place, sourcing and selling of broiler chickens and products. Framework analysis was used to identify governance themes and risky sanitary practices present in the system. One large company was identified to supply 60% of Nairobi's day-old chicks to farmers, mainly through agrovet shops. Broiler meat products from integrated companies were sold in high-end retailers whereas their low value products were channelled through independent traders to consumers in informal settlements. Periurban small-scale farmers reported to slaughter the broilers on the farm and to sell carcasses to retailers (hotels and butcheries mainly) through brokers (80%), while farmers in the informal settlement reported to sell their broilers live to retailers (butcheries, hotels and hawkers mainly) directly. Broiler heads and legs were sold in informal settlements via roadside vendors. Sanitary risks identified were related to lack of biosecurity, cold chain and access to water, poor hygiene practices, lack of inspection at farm slaughter and limited health inspection in markets. Large companies dominated the governance of the broiler system through the control of day-old chick production. Overall government control was described as relatively weak leading to minimal official regulatory enforcement. Large companies and brokers were identified as dominant groups in market information dissemination and price setting. Lack of farmer association was found to be system-wide and to limit market access. Other system barriers included lack of space and expertise, leading to poor infrastructure and limited ability to implement effective hygienic measures. This study highlights significant structural differences between different broiler chains and inequalities in product quality and market access across the system. It provides a foundation for food safety assessments, disease control programmes and informs policy-making for the inclusive growth of this fast-evolving sector.","[Carron, Maud; Alarcon, Pablo; Haesler, Barbara; Rushton, Jonathan] Royal Vet Coll, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England; [Carron, Maud; Haesler, Barbara] Leverhulme Ctr Integrat Res Agr & Hlth, 36 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England; [Korani, Maurice; Muinde, Patrick; Akoko, James; Fevre, Eric M.] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Fevre, Eric M.; Rushton, Jonathan] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Leahurst Campus,Chester High Rd, Neston CH64 7TE, England; [Onono, Joshua] Univ Nairobi, POB 29053-00625, Nairobi, Kenya",University of London; University of London Royal Veterinary College; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); University of Liverpool; University of Nairobi,"Carron, M (corresponding author), Royal Vet Coll, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England.",mcarron@rvc.ac.uk,,,"UK Medical Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council (UK); Natural Environment Research Council (UK), through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI) [G1100783/1]; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Department of Veterinary Services within the Kenyan Ministry of Livestock Development; Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK); MRC [G1100783] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (UK), through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI); CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)(CGIAR); Department of Veterinary Services within the Kenyan Ministry of Livestock Development; Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This study was supported by the UK Medical Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Council (UK), the Economic and Social Research Council (UK), the Natural Environment Research Council (UK), through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ESEI), Grant Reference: G1100783/1.

Detecting deforestation associated with the export of avocados from Mexico to the United States,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,Avocado; Deforestation; Supply chain transparency; Governance; U.S-Mexico trade,RANDOM FOREST; GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; CHAINS; RED,"The United States (U.S.) imports 87 percent of its avocados from a single Mexican region, Michoacan. Although environmental and social costs associated with avocado production are significant, consumers and retailers in the U.S. cannot clearly discern them in part due to complex, opaque supply chains. In this paper, we use a novel methodology, TRAcking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST), to reconstruct avocado supply chains between the U.S. retailers and Mexican producers and exporters. Using remote sensing and machine learning, we document how avocado plantations are associated with deforestation in Michoacan, whose forests are important reservoirs for biodiversity, especially for the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We estimate that-20% of the total deforestation in Michoacan between 2001 and 2017 is associated with the expansion of avocado plantations. Despite these impacts, interviews reveal that industry associates (namely, representatives of firms and associations) do not consider avocado production to be a driver of deforestation in the region. This disconnect between actual and perceived environmental impacts can be addressed by the U.S. governmental agencies that play influential roles in regulating avocado imports for sanitary and health purposes and by the vertically integrated avocado trading firms that connect Michoacan packing houses to Kroger, Costco, and other prominent U.S. grocers. Key measures to make the U.S.-Mexico avocado supply chain more sustainable include conventional regulatory tools, greater transparency, and improved governance through multi-stakeholder initiatives.","[Cho, Kimin; Goldstein, Benjamin; Gounaridis, Dimitrios; Newell, Joshua P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Cho, KM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",choki@umich.edu; benjgo@umich.edu; dgounar@umich.edu; jpnewell@umich.edu,,,,,,,67,39,42,4,59,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,JAN 15,2021,278,,1,,,,,,111482,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111482,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study addresses the need to enhance supply chain resilience while considering social, environmental, and economic aspects, especially in view of the vulnerabilities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. While previous studies have examined SCR, DOC and AC individually, there is a gap in the literature regarding an integrated model. This research aims to fill this gap by analysing the relationships between DOC and AC, their impact on SCR and SP. Through an empirical study (304 observations), this research provides valuable insights into these constructs in a developing economy like Mexico, where the manufacturing sector holds significant economic importance. This research uses the partial least squares technique to shed light on risk mitigation and sustainability strategies. The results show that DOC has positive effects on dynamic capabilities (AC and SCR) and performance. Moreover, the indirect effects analysis concludes that DOC significantly impacts SP through the improvement this culture provokes in AC and SCR. The findings will assist practitioners and policymakers develop strategies to strengthen SCR and promote sustainable business practices, ensuring preparedness for future disruptions.","[Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Ruben Michael] Univ Autonoma Aguascalientes, Ctr Ciencias Econ & Adm, Doctorado Ciencias Adm, UAA, Aguascalientes, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Ruben Michael] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Doctorado Ciencias Econ Empresariales & Jurid, Ave Univ 940, Aguascalientes 20131, Mexico; [Madrid-Guijarro, Antonia] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Calle Real,3, Cartagena 30201, Spain; [Maldonado-Guzman, Gonzalo] Univ Autonoma Aguascalientes, Dept Mkt, Invest & Posgrad UAA, Ave Univ,940, Aguscalientes 20131, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes,"Madrid-Guijarro, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ Accounting & Finance, Calle Real,3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",Michael_lamborgini@hotmail.com; antonia.madrid@upct.es; gonzalo.maldonado@edu.uaa.mx,,,EIT Climate-KIC HEI Initiative Inno-EUT + Project Cohort 1,EIT Climate-KIC HEI Initiative Inno-EUT + Project Cohort 1,This work was supported by the EIT Climate-KIC HEI Initiative Inno-EUT + Project Cohort 1; Ca tedra de Emprendimiento Santander- Uni-versidad Polite cnica de Cartagena; Doctoral studies at Universidad Auto noma de Aguascaslientes.,,84,11,11,19,69,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,SEP 25,2023,420,,,,,,,,138411,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138411,,AUG 2023,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is important from the earliest development stages in alternative energy research due to potential impacts from the commercialization of products into global mass production. The authors constructed a framework for examining risk-based, supply chain due diligence in higher education laboratory research. The focus was on materials which present ethical risks including 'conflict minerals' and 'critical materials', with the latter including rare earth elements. These materials can potentially have security of supply issues and/or cause social, conflict and environmental impacts including human rights abuses. The authors applied the framework to one year's procurement of materials at two Australian universities' laboratories, researching battery storage and solar energy and identified suppliers, and suppliers' policies on procurement of materials with potential risks. In search of best-practices in higher education policies on laboratory procurement, the authors analyzed procurement and supply chain policies from four Australian universities involved in alternative energy materials research, and identified emerging international, higher educational procurement policies for conflict minerals. Key issues regarding critical materials, and regulatory approaches to conflict minerals were discussed, leading to proposed actions for Higher Educational leaders to enhance ethical alternative energy research procurement and subsequent product innovation. This reinforces the importance of research strategy including materials choices. In other words, it is important to get it right at an early stage.

Smart Mixes, which are combinations of compulsory and voluntary measures, have been proposed as a possible means of securing environmental and social standards, but the concept has not been operationalized in the academic literature. We aim to identify the factors that have contributed to, or hindered, the performance of existing Smart Mixes in three international value chains (conflict minerals, palm oil, and bonds) using data from interviews with 32 experts, supplemented by a literature review. The results suggest that Smart Mixes are effective when they cover a specific issue under conditions in which enforcement mechanisms create a level playing field: thereby aligning public and private sector interests. The keys to success in a Smart Mix include positive interactions, harmonization, and complementary and supportive measures, which combine to motivate engagement by the private sector. We conclude that Smart Mixes can contribute to sustainability in value chains but their effectiveness is dependent on the strength of the relationships between the measures that compose them. Applying the Smart Mix concept with 'real world' examplesGovernments of consumer countries have to satisfy the wishes of their citizens for sustainability of imported products, but most of the global value chains lie outside their jurisdictions. A solution is to create Smart Mixes of national and international, compulsory, and voluntary measures that align the goals of government and industry, but the practicability of such mixes has been challenged. The aim of this contribution is to identify whether such Smart Mixes exist in the real world and examine which factors contribute to their performance. We interviewed 32 experts from three international value chains (conflict minerals, palm oil, and bonds) and found that the Smart Mix concept is indeed viable under certain conditions. This implies that Smart Mixes may indeed a tool for governments of consumer countries to achieve sustainability goals with regard to imports.

The Case of South African Table Grape Producers,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,entrepreneurship; sustainability; economic sustainability; global supply chain,GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES,"Global trade is strongly growing and becoming connected to the issue of sustainable development in business practices. In recent years this has resulted in businesses on the demand side formulating sets of requirements for suppliers on their performance on corporate social responsibility and sustainable production. In doing this, value systems of the industrialized world are forwarded towards developing countries. It is seen as a way to complement poor sustainability policies on practices in these countries. This relatively new phenomenon of promoting sustainable development through market interactions is quite remarkable. Why would economic actors take up such public interests (abating environmental degradation and social injustice)? From the perspective of developing countries on the supply side of global value chains, being able to commit to such business-to-business standards requires developing world producers to possess certain qualities and capacities. This article reflects on this issue, identifying essential capacities, drawn from literature on (sustainable) entrepreneurship.

It has been shown that I5.0 can enhance sustainability within supply chains (SCs). However, companies in emerging economies, especially small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs), which are crucial to developing economies, face challenges in implementing these concepts. These SMEs are in the early stages of adopting I5.0 to foster sustainability in their SCs and require urgent identification of key I5.0 enablers. Unfortunately, the current literature lacks research on this topic specifically within the context of SMEs in emerging economies. To bridge this gap, this study identifies the enablers of I5.0 that promote sustainability diffusion in SCs, using China's SME manufacturing sector as a case study. The integrated framework for applying multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques in this study aims to assist decision-makers in evaluating different options and making optimal choices in a systematic and structured manner when faced with complex situations. The study employs the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to identify 15 key I5.0 enablers and categorize them into three clusters. Grey-DEMATEL is subsequently utilized to determine the causal relationships, rank the importance of the enablers, and construct an interrelationship diagram. This study found that 'availability and functionality of resources'; 'top management support, active participation, and effective governance'; 'support from government, regulators, and financial resources'; and 'introduction of safer and more efficient robotic systems for human-robot interaction and collaboration' serve as the primary means of resolving issues. Overall, this study helps managers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in I5.0 applications to promote sustainability in the supply chain.","[Hsu, Chih-Hung; Liu, Jian-Cen; Cai, Xue-Qing] Fujian Univ Technol, Coll Transportat, Inst Logist Engn & Management, Fuzhou 350118, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ting-Yi; Lv, Wan-Ying] Fujian Univ Technol, Inst Ind Engn, Coll Management, Fuzhou 350118, Peoples R China",Fujian University of Technology; Fujian University of Technology,"Hsu, CH (corresponding author), Fujian Univ Technol, Coll Transportat, Inst Logist Engn & Management, Fuzhou 350118, Peoples R China.",chhsu@fjut.edu.cn; jiancenliu@smail.fjut.edu.cn; caixueqing222@gmail.com; 19821809@fjut.edu.cn; cc41806@126.com,,,Fujian Provincial Social Science Foundation of China; [FJ2024T020],Fujian Provincial Social Science Foundation of China;,This paper was supported by the Fujian Provincial Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. FJ2024T020).,,98,0,0,5,5,,,,,2227-7390,,,,DEC,2024,12,24,,,,,,,3938,10.3390/math12243938,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math12243938,,,,Mathematics,,Mathematics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the continuous deepening of retailer's participation in supply chain management, the green services they provided by retailer have become a crucial role in promoting the terminal sales of green products. To further research the government subsidies and retailer's fairness concerns on the optimal decisions of product pricing, green R&D, and service level, we construct four two-stage GSC models: no subsidy and fairness concerns, subsidizes manufacturer without retailer's fairness concerns, subsidizes manufacturer with retailer's fairness concerns, and subsidizes all members with retailer's fairness concerns. The results show that subsidizes to manufacturers has significantly improved supply chain performance and environmental governance, but it exacerbates the unfair distribution of profits among members, and retailers' fairness concerns drive them to offer lower green service level. With the green demand of consumers being unable to be fully satisfied, the consumer surplus and effectiveness of government environmental governance decrease accordingly. To eliminate the adverse effect caused by unfair distribution of profits, it is necessary to subsidize retailers so as to share their green service costs and increase their share of profits.","[Shi, Wei; Hu, Jiawei; Sun, Suqin; Meng, Qiang; Zhang, Xuemei] Fuyang Normal Univ, Business Sch, Fuyang 236037, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wei; Meng, Qiang; Zhang, Xuemei] Fuyang Normal Univ, Anhui Prov Key Lab Reg Logist Planning & Modern Lo, Fuyang 236037, Anhui, Peoples R China",Fuyang Normal University; Fuyang Normal University,"Meng, Q (corresponding author), Fuyang Normal Univ, Business Sch, Fuyang 236037, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Meng, Q (corresponding author), Fuyang Normal Univ, Anhui Prov Key Lab Reg Logist Planning & Modern Lo, Fuyang 236037, Anhui, Peoples R China.",1062399126@qq.com; 3193457219@qq.com; 2192974942@qq.com; qiangmeng@fynu.edu.cn; xmzhang@fynu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771055]; Project of Natural Science of Provincial Platform [2020WLGH01]; Key Research Projects of University Level Humanities and Social Sciences [2021FSSK01ZD],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Natural Science of Provincial Platform; Key Research Projects of University Level Humanities and Social Sciences,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71771055), Project of Natural Science of Provincial Platform (Grant no. 2020WLGH01), and Key Research Projects of University Level Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant no. 2021FSSK01ZD).",,49,5,5,8,37,,,,1024-123X,1563-5147,,,,MAY 10,2022,2022,,,,,,,,6009764,10.1155/2022/6009764,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6009764,,,,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",,Engineering; Mathematics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To ensure the viability of certification, it is important to understand its socioeconomic implications for certificate holders. Existing literature focuses on the economic impacts of certification within specific contexts (e.g., specific feedstock, regions, supply chain elements), and rarely addresses the social impacts. The present systematic literature review analyses the findings of 75 scientific articles covering the socioeconomic impacts of certification on producers of biobased feedstock (i.e. palm oil, maize, natural rubber, soybean, sugar cane, wood, and raw cotton) and related supply chains. The socioeconomic impacts are aggregated into 7 economic outcome categories (direct costs, indirect costs, revenues, income, productivity, price premiums, market access) and 5 social ones (health, education, poverty reduction, labour conditions, wellbeing). The results show that the economic impacts of certification are generally positive, with economic benefits compensating for the increased costs faced by companies after certification. Smallholders and companies located in low-income countries are more likely to experience negative economic impacts after certification because they have less access to resources for financing high upfront costs or legal documents on certification requirements, and face proportionally higher certification costs. The social impacts have been less investigated than the economic ones, and the results showed more mixed findings, although still mostly positive. Looking across the supply chain, both economic and social impacts were found to be investigated more for feedstock producers compared to other actors in the supply chains. New policy should focus on mitigating the negative impacts on vulnerable groups to improve their participation in certification programmes.","[Rossi, Costanza; Shen, Li; Junginger, Martin] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 8, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Rossi, Costanza] SQ Consult, Prins Bernhardstr 27, NL-3981 BL Bunnik, Netherlands; [Wicke, Birka] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Environm Sci, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Rossi, C (corresponding author), SQ Consult, Prins Bernhardstr 27, NL-3981 BL Bunnik, Netherlands.",c.rossi@uu.nl,,,"Horizon Europe [101060133, 101086086]; Horizon Europe - Pillar II [101060133, 101086086] Funding Source: Horizon Europe - Pillar II",Horizon Europe; Horizon Europe - Pillar II(European Union (EU)Horizon Europe - Pillar II),This research was funded by the Horizon Europe projects HARMO- NITOR [grant number 101060133] and 3CO [grant number 101086086] .,,94,5,5,6,8,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,AUG 25,2024,468,,,,,,,,143079,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143079,,JUL 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most production occurs in lower- and middle-income countries, and therefore, they can improve the efficiency and modernize the production systems to increase exports to earn foreign exchange earnings for economic and social development. The institutional arrangements should be part of the mechanisms that ensure sustainable aquaculture growth, through the participation of all stakeholders. Sustainability is possible with good and dynamic governance through which the industry embraces the basic principles of governance, equity, accountability, efficiency, and predictability. Over the past decade, several countries made changes in governance and implemented regulations through their action plans to improve aquaculture productivity, and stakeholders profited from the changes made along the value chain. For the producers to benefit from the value-added products, they complied with the regulations imposed by the importing countries, international regulatory bodies, or their own consumers. Standards increased, and the implementation of certification resulted in changes in the industrial structure. These standards, which inflict regulatory cost on producers, stimulated an improvement in productivity and product quality. However, during the last decade, production growth declined from 5.8% from 2001 to 2010 to 4.5% from 2011 to 2018, resulting in the elusive realization of the potential of meeting the sustainable development targets. There is a need for a paradigm shift that encourages small-scale producers to engage in sustainable intensive aquaculture. The challenge is, therefore, to move toward production intensification and expansion, and the harmonization of national and international regulations to ensure the supply of safe and adequate fish to consumers, while maintaining a sustainable production system, and at the same time conserving the environment and maintaining social and economic stability. With good governance and political will, the social, economic, and environmental objectives for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals during the period 2020-2030 are possible if governments integrate sustainable aquaculture developments within an expanded aquatic and terrestrial food security policy framework using systems thinking and open innovation approaches.","[Jolly, Curtis M.] Auburn Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Nyandat, Beatrice] State Dept Fisheries Aquaculture & Blue Econ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Yang, Zhengyong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ridler, Neil] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Econ, St John, NB, Canada; [Matias, Felipe] FUNCAP, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Matias, Felipe] Univ Fed Ceara, Fisheries & Engn, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Zhang, Zhiyi] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Murekezi, Pierre; Menezes, Ana] FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture Div, Rome, Italy; [Jolly, Curtis M.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Shanghai Ocean University; University of New Brunswick; Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (FUNCAP); Universidade Federal do Ceara; Shanghai Ocean University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Jolly, CM (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",jollycm@auburn.edu,,,,,,,310,20,21,6,39,,,,0893-8849,1749-7345,,,,APR,2023,54,2,,,SI,,427,481,,10.1111/jwas.12967,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12967,,APR 2023,,Fisheries,,Fisheries,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results confirmed that ESG investment has a significant role in net-zero carbon emission and fosters natural capital stocks in the Chinese ecosystem. The results further established that natural capital stocks significantly benefit the Chinese ecosystem and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 emission - gaseous fuel, CO2 emission - solid fuel, and carbon intensity. Moreover, natural capital stocks have a significant role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions and it accelerates gross tree cover and green agricultural yield. The study is of great interest to corporations, Chinese banks, and the government in planning and achieving net-zero carbon emissions as per Prudential Financial regulation and accounting reporting systems.

Consequently, the demand for battery raw materials is continuously growing. As an illustration, to meet the net-zero emissions targets, the electric vehicle market demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite will increase 26-times, 6-times, 12-times, and 9-times respectively between 2021 and 2050. There are diverse challenges in meeting this demand, requiring the world to embrace technological and knowledge advancements and new investments without provoking conflicts between competing goals. The uncertainties in a sustainable supply of battery minerals, environmental, social and governance complexities, and geopolitical tensions throughout the whole battery value chain have shaped the global and regional concerns over the success of transport decarbonization. Here, focusing on the entire value chain of electric vehicle batteries, the approaches adopted by regulatory agencies, governments, mining companies, vehicle and battery manufacturers, and all the other stakeholders are evaluated. Bringing together all these aspects, this literature review broadens the scope for providing multifaceted solutions necessary to optimize the goal of transport decarbonization while upholding sustainability criteria. Consolidating the previously fragmented information, a solid foundation for more in-depth research on existing difficulties encountered by governmental and industrial actors is created. The outcomes of this study may serve as a baseline to develop a framework for a climate smart and resource efficient supply of batteries considering the unique impacts of individual players.","[Niri, Anahita Jannesar; Rosenkranz, Jan] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Poelzer, Gregory A.; Pettersson, Maria] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Social Sci Technol & Arts, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Zhang, Steven E.] 39 Kiewiet St,Helikon Pk, ZA-1759 Randfontein, South Africa; [Ghorbani, Yousef] Univ Lincoln, Sch Chem, Joseph Banks Labs, Green Lane, Lincoln LN6 7DL, England",Lulea University of Technology; Lulea University of Technology; University of Lincoln,"Niri, AJ (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.;Ghorbani, Y (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Sch Chem, Joseph Banks Labs, Green Lane, Lincoln LN6 7DL, England.",anahita.jannesar.niri@ltu.se; yghorbani@lincoln.ac.uk,,,Formas-A Swidish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas) [2021-02439]; Formas [2021-02439] Funding Source: Formas,Formas-A Swidish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This study is part of Clean-Mineral project (Climate friendly mineral supply chains in transition to the green economy) , for which funding was provided by Formas-A Swidish Research Council for Sustainable Development (Formas dnr 2021-02439) .",,216,70,70,43,86,,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,MAR,2024,191,,,,,,,,114176,10.1016/j.rser.2023.114176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.114176,,DEC 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is a crucial omission, because without consumer demand for socially produced products, the reach of the social benefits is likely to be limited. We develop a comprehensive model that links two characteristics of market-based social governance schemes-(1) stringency and enforcement of requirements, and (2) promotion-to two conditions required for governance schemes to generate significant social benefits: (1) socially responsible behavior of participating firms; and (2) consumer demand for socially produced products which, in turn, expands products produced according to social governance schemes, and thus, the quantity of social benefits.

Such innovations often start out in niches; however, the scaling up and the ultimate replacement of current socio-technical systems requires governance to allow for the coordination of actors, the reorganization of socio-technical systems and the mobilization and allocation of resources. As governmental institutions are part of the current (non-sustainable) systems and thereby fail to provide coherent, integrated and transformative governance, we explore whether institutional innovation from non-state actors can step in to provide governance of transformation processes.

The triple bottom line identifies the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability. These could be harnessed to improve the supply chain of locally produced rice, ultimately improving food security in the region. This paper adopts a quantitative method that uses 21 criteria from the three sustainability dimensions to measure rice stakeholders' decision-making activities against sustainable rice practices (SRPs) using a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process multi-criteria decision-making approach. The findings reveal that decisions with regard to water usage, supplier diversity, and a safe working environment were ranked high, while government intervention, quality assurance, transparency, and power usage ranked low. This implies that improved performance of other stakeholders across the rice value chain such as the government and extension officers would enhance productivity and drive food security in the region.","[Bello, Adenike Oluyemi; Mbhele, Thokozani Patmond] Univ Kwazulu Natal, Coll Law & Management Studies, Sch Management Informat Technol & Governance, Westville Campus, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Bello, AO; Mbhele, TP (corresponding author), Univ Kwazulu Natal, Coll Law & Management Studies, Sch Management Informat Technol & Governance, Westville Campus, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",219096260@stu.ukzn.ac.za; mbhelet@ukzn.ac.za,,,University of KwaZulu-Natal,University of KwaZulu-Natal,The authors acknowledge support from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and RIFAN members of Edu-Patigi local government area of Kwara state who participated in the research.,,49,1,1,3,9,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR,2024,16,5,,,,,,,1751,10.3390/su16051751,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16051751,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find a positive association between ESG disclosure level and firm value, suggesting that improved transparency and accountability and enhanced stakeholder trust play a role in boosting firm value. We also report that higher CEO power enhances the ESG disclosure effect on firm value, indicating that stakeholders associate ESG disclosure from firms with higher CEO power with greater commitment to ESG practice. This evidence is strong and consistent for three different measures of ESG-related disclosure: the ESG, environmental and social disclosure scores.

Traditional crowdsensing involves smartphone users sharing information to fulfill specific tasks while maximizing their rewards. But, implementing crowdsensing for ESG demands (1) cost-sharing to support technology adoption by information providers, (2) tracking the ownership and use of information, and (3) tackling the drawback of monetary incentives. This study investigates a novel digital asset tokenization mechanism for crowdsensing in ESG disclosure. Its blockchain tokens can keep track of each user's identity and consumption behavior to deliver necessary symbolic incentives to the information or digital asset provider. We model the interaction between providers and users as a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the participants' usage levels and optimal investment in technology. The incentive mechanism considers various factors such as technology adoption costs, level of cost sharing, and symbolic incentives to reveal their impact on participant benefits. Moreover, we endogenize the cost-sharing to evaluate/study the factors influencing the ideal/optimal cost-sharing level from digital asset consumers. We find that an increase in reputation incentive per token stimulates token consumption, which leads to more significant payoffs for the participants. Conversely, increasing technology adoption costs decreases token consumption, leading to lesser profits for the participants. However, in the case of cost-sharing, there exists a unique level of cost-sharing before (after) which utility of DA consumer increase (decreases), i.e., an incentive mechanism built on endogenous cost-sharing exhibits a competitive advantage over exogenous cost-sharing in terms of the profit it delivers to the DA consumers.","[Harish, Arjun Rachana] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ming; Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ming; Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Adv Mfg, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wei] Chongqing Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Chongqing University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Huang, GQ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",arjun197@connect.hku.hk; bravew@cqu.edu.cn; ming.li@polyu.edu.hk; gq.huang@polyu.edu.hk,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2023A1515011203]; RGC Theme-based Research Scheme, China [P0043406]; RGC Research Impact Fund, China [R7036-22]; Start-up Fund of PolyU, China; [T32-707/22-N]","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); RGC Theme-based Research Scheme, China; RGC Research Impact Fund, China; Start-up Fund of PolyU, China;","This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No.2023A1515011203) , the RGC Theme-based Research Scheme, China (No.T32-707/22-N) , the RGC Research Impact Fund, China (No.R7036-22) and the Start-up Fund of PolyU, China (No.P0043406) .",,51,11,11,18,59,,,,0360-8352,1879-0550,,,,NOV,2023,185,,,,,,,,109664,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109664,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109664,,OCT 2023,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Industrial",,Computer Science; Engineering,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Emphasising the supplier-customer interaction, 'Industry 5.0' is technological revolution, which is a value-driven initiative that drives knowledge spillovers along the sustainable supply chain (SSC). In this context, enterprises are incorporating more GTI activities into their partners' SSC strategies. This study employs samples of China's A-share listed companies covering the period from 2010 to 2021 to examine the spillover effects between customers' GTI and suppliers total factor productivity (TFP). Both GTI and TFP indicators are important representations of 'Industry 5.0', with our major concerning on the enhancement of supplier's long-term orientation (LTO). We calculated TFP by the Olley-Pakes and Levinsohn-Petrin methods, dividing GTI indicators into three levels: substantial green technological innovation (SGTI), non-substantial green technological innovation (NGTI), and overall green technological innovation (OGTI). Our empirical results show that 1) Customer's GTI contributes to supplier's TFP, and supplier's LTO including environmental, social & governance (ESG) performance, and R&D input can strengthen this beneficial link; 2) customer's NGTI represents a significant differentiation in comparison with SGTI, where R&D investment weakens the positive relationship between customer's NGTI and supplier's TFP; 3) heterogeneity analysis indicates that the spillovers of customer's GTI on supplier's TFP are more pronounced among state-owned enterprises, high-tech enterprises, and non-polluting enterprises. Notably, the connectedness demonstrates dynamic patterns through 2SLS and GMM regressions, highlighting the importance of enterprises' SSC and LTO being the shock transmitters to their TFP. Our study is prone to benefit lawmakers, regulators, and firm executives responsible for analysing and assessing the SSC, providing more policy implications with future prospects for sustainable transformation in the upcoming 'Industry 5.0' era.

Here, we explore the potential for independent oil palm smallholders in Indonesia to participate in zero -deforestation supply chains. We find that these smallholders are underrepresented in the share of zero -deforestation compliant oil palm production. We then synthesize perspectives from key actors in the oil palm industry including smallholders and their representatives, palm oil producing and consulting companies, nongovernmental organizations, and academic researchers. Based on these perspectives, we find that challenges to smallholder supply chain participation include limitations in knowledge (e.g., smallholders may not know the location of protected forests), institutional issues (e.g., absence of trust between oil palm growing companies and smallholder farmers), and financial constraints (e.g., the opportunity cost of not clearing forest). To address these shortcomings, we encourage oil palm growing and milling companies to take the lead on incentivizing, supporting, and facilitating smallholder participation in zero -deforestation initiatives. Specifically, these companies could build and use their technical and political resources to identify and map all forests in their entire supply shed and ensure small producers have land rights that enable participation in zero -deforestation supply chains. These policy levers would need to be combined with economic incentives such as access to improved inputs or price premia for their products. However, we caution that smallholder integration into existing zero -deforestation supply chains alone is unlikely to result in significant additional forest conservation at scale in Indonesia due to selection bias, leakage, and existing land tenure norms. Community -led and jurisdictional or landscape -scale supply chain initiatives that acknowledge multi -commodity production are more likely to provide equitable and just avenues for Indonesian smallholder farmers to steward forest resources.","[Eggen, Michael] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Sci Nat & People Partnership, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Heilmayr, Robert] UC Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Heilmayr, Robert] UC Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Bren Hall, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Anderson, Patrick] Forest Peoples Programme, Moreton In Marsh, England; [Armson, Rebecca] Goodhope, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Armson, Rebecca] PT Evans Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Austin, Kemen] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Forest & Climate Program, Bronx, NY USA; [Azmi, Reza] Wild Asia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Bayliss, Peter] PT REA Kaltim Plantat, East Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Burns, David] Natl WildlifeFederat, Int Wildlife Conservat, Washington, DC USA; [Burns, David] World Resources Inst, Climate Program, Washington, DC USA; [Erbaugh, J.

We first present a number of perspectives on this topic from disciplines such as economic geography, management science, sociology and environmental sciences. Each of these approaches brings in a specific focus: the consequences of geographical dispersion of economic activities, measurement of ecological and social impact, managing sustainability in supply chains, and power asymmetry among economic actors. Until now, these disciplinary research lines have remained unconnected. We argue that ecological economics provides a promising background for a more holistic conceptualization. To this end, we formulate five basic questions that serve to advance the study of sustainability throughout the product chain by connecting the foci of the identified scientific disciplines.

Embodied energy injustices reframe considerations of energy justice to explicitly consider hidden and distant injustices (upstream or downstream) arising from the extraction, processing, transportation and disposal of energy resources. We assess the embodied energy injustices connected to the decision to decommission a coal-fired power plant in Salem, Massachusetts, US, and its replacement with a natural-gas-fired power station. Cerrejon open-pit coalmine in La Guajira, Colombia, powered the Salem plant for over a decade. Fracked gas from Pennsylvania now supplies fuel for the new power station. Comparing the extraction of these two very different fuels reveals multiple parallel injustices. But the regulatory environment fails to account for the different constituencies, jurisdictions and effects that fall outside the formal remit of existing impact assessments. We therefore call for mandatory transboundary impact assessments of large-scale energy-related projects, which explicitly integrate previously unrecognized social-environmental harms and injustices. Expanding energy law and policy discussions to incorporate embodied energy injustices can enhance sustainable energy governance and enable corporate accountability for the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and use. Linking chains of energy injustice-by revealing their interconnected positions along fossil-fuel supply chains-may help generate and unite powerful trans-local solidarity movements, which politicize local struggles within wider national, regional and global energy politics.","[Healy, Noel] Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA 01970 USA; [Stephens, Jennie C.] Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Global Resilience Inst, 650 Huntington Ave,RP 310J, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Malin, Stephanie A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Sociol, B234 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Salem State University; Northeastern University; Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins,"Healy, N (corresponding author), Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA 01970 USA.",nhealy@salemstate.edu,,,Salem State University; Northeastern University; Rachael Carson Center Fellow program at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich; Brown University's Center for Environmental Studies and Environmental Change Initiative/Voss Environmental Fellows program,Salem State University; Northeastern University; Rachael Carson Center Fellow program at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich; Brown University's Center for Environmental Studies and Environmental Change Initiative/Voss Environmental Fellows program,"We wish to thank the people who participated in this study, particularly: Wayuu, Afro-Colombian, and campesino communities in La Guajira; farmers in Pennsylvania; and interviewees in Massachusetts.

Through examining a key global food sector, the soy-meat value chain, we assess how effective market governance is. In this sector, numerous supply chain approaches have proliferated ranging from the first deforestation-free supply chain sectoral standard, to eco-labelling, and collective actions on various topics. To assess how effective these policy instruments are, we examine the choices in sustainability made by lead companies in the sector and then analyse how coordinated these initiatives are across the supply chain. We then assess, via a litereture review, which actors are creating 'rules of the game' for sustainability, and the impacts of these on coordination and on-the-ground impacts. We show that companies along the soy-meat value chain have made different sustainability commitments probably because they are facing very different risk factors: those upstream such as soy traders are concerned mainly with international pressures associated with deforestation, whilst those further downstream in the supply chain have from very loose to very ambitious sustainability objectives on various topics associated with the sector including animal welfare, climate change and human-health. We found that these supply chain initiatives are not addressing sufficiently the cause and effect of key drivers of sectoral impacts such as land appreciation and the global demand for cheap meat. Further, because the soy-meat sector is vertically integrated both upstream and downstream, this may result in comparable bargaining power among business actors such that none of these actors may be able to impose sustainability norms without inferring cost onto themselves or causing perverse outcomes. A lack of coordination in market governance is translating into a lack of uptake in various instruments (e.g. certification) or transference of cost and responsibilities onto soy producers (e.g. deforestation free standard such as the Soy Moratorium). A perverse outcome of the latter is the displacement of impacts onto other regions and commodities. In light of these challenges in market governance, we encourage more emphasis on network governance, which involves more social interactions that build trust, vision and exchanges of information and resources (e.g. between Brazil and China and Europe), these being more important in early phases of transitions for systems facing sustainability gridlock.

They then draw on corporate policies with varying degrees of alignment to disseminate and enforce corresponding behavioral rules among their suppliers and business partners. This goal-based turn in private sustainability governance has important implications for its likely environmental and social outcomes. Drawing on paradox theory, this article uses a case study of zero-deforestation commitments in the Indonesian palm oil sector to argue that goal-based private sustainability governance's characteristics set the stage for two types of paradoxes to emerge: performing paradoxes between environmental, social, and economic sustainability goals, and organizing paradoxes between cooperation and competition approaches. Companies' responses to these paradoxes, in turn, can explain the lack of full goal attainment and differential rates of progress between actors. These results draw our attention to the complexities hidden behind governance through goal setting in the corporate space, and raise important questions about the viability of similar strategies such as science-based targets and net-zero goals.","[Grabs, Janina; Garrett, Rachael D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Environm Policy Lab, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Grabs, Janina] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Av Torre Blanca 59, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08172, Spain; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); University of Cambridge,"Grabs, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Environm Policy Lab, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Grabs, J (corresponding author), Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Av Torre Blanca 59, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08172, Spain.",janina.grabs@esade.edu; rg711@cam.ac.uk,,,"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich); Fonds Welternaehrungssystem, World Food System Center, ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation [100017_192373]; European Research Council [949932]; ETH Zurich; European Research Council (ERC) [949932] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100017_192373] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)(ETH Zurich); Fonds Welternaehrungssystem, World Food System Center, ETH Zurich; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","Open access funding provided by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).

However, <1 % of global hydrogen production is low-carbon. Moreover, efforts to scale up hydrogen production and use will confront multiple barriers that could delay decarbonisation outcomes. Government proposals to build a vast infrastructure for producing and consuming low-carbon hydrogen thus carry significant risks to decarbonisation. The extant literature has examined financial and physical risks of proposed hydrogen supply chains. But broader interdisciplinary perspectives on the challenges to achieving decarbonisation via hydrogen lack. In this study, we employ an integrative review (considering literature from diverse fields and many methodologies) to comprehensively identify the risks for national decarbonisation goals posed by emerging low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. Following categories proposed by the IPCC, our review reveals thirty-two risks across seven categories (geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, institutional, geopolitical). To increase the framework's value as a decision-making tool, we also suggest illustrative indicators and potential data sources for them, to evaluate the severity of these risks. The framework prompts a shift for hydrogen development discussions away from asking how hydrogen contributes to decarbonisation, instead prompting questions of where hydrogen can be used with the least risk to reducing emissions around the world.","[Carlson, Jordan Thomas; Trencher, Gregory] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Yoshidahonmachi,Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Kyoto University,"Carlson, JT (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Yoshidahonmachi,Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",carlson.jordan.63j@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research was funded in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.",,161,2,2,7,14,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,OCT,2024,116,,,,,,,,103685,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103685,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2024.103685,,JUL 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on the governance structures used to extend sustainability to suppliers. More specifically, the authors aim to answer two questions: What is the impact of these mechanisms or governance structures on sustainable performance? and What are the enablers of these mechanisms?. Design/methodology/approach - A structured literature review is carried out that analyses published studies, evaluates contributions, summarises knowledge and identifies managerial implications and lines for further research. Findings - Both assessment and collaboration have a positive impact on environmental performance and corporate social responsibility, although the most recent collaborative paradigm stresses that assessment alone is not enough. Some enablers of these practices are identified. Research limitations/implications - Although the authors believe that the right search terms have been used, the choice of these terms could be a limitation of this study. Also, the selection of the articles could be considered subjective, although the papers were reviewed by two researchers. Practical implications - Supplier assessment and collaboration are effective in improving sustainability. However, the results also indicate that assessment alone is not enough. Firms also need to adopt a collaborative approach. Finally, a list of enablers to implement these practices is provided. Originality/value - The paper summarises knowledge related to the impact of supplier assessment and the enablers of such initiatives, providing some managerial implications and lines for further research.","[Gimenez, Cristina] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Dept Operat Management & Innovat, Avda, Spain; [Tachizawa, Elcio M.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE); Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Gimenez, C (corresponding author), Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Dept Operat Management & Innovat, Avda, Spain.",cristina.gimenez@esade.edu,,,,,,,64,493,520,4,360,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,,2012,17,5,,,,,531,543,,10.1108/13598541211258591,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13598541211258591,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In light of the rapid growth of online shopping, the dual-channel supply chain has gained significant popularity. Governments have implemented policies to achieve carbon peaks and neutrality worldwide. Considering green quality and channel preferences, this study constructs a Stackelberg model led by the manufacturer within a dual-channel supply chain to compare the effects under two government subsidy strategies. A Stackelberg game-theoretic approach is applied to analyze the model. The findings indicate the following: (1) Increases in the subsidy coefficient can increase product greenness and the overall profit in both subsidy strategies, which makes sense; (2) When direct sales channels become dominant, subsidizing the manufacturer proves superior to subsidizing the retailer in terms of promoting green quality and overall profit, which extends existing studies of government subsidy decisions. Furthermore, subsidizing the retailer may negatively affect the total supply chain profit; (3) Consistent with previous literature, intense competition between manufacturers and retailers is expected to enhance the overall profit of the supply chain; (4) Interestingly, customer preference for online channels does not influence product green quality under manufacturer subsidization strategies but exhibits a negative impact under retailer subsidization strategies.

In this paper, we re-measure the upstreamness of Chinese enterprises in global value chains as described by Ni Hongfu (2022). Subsequently, the impact of environmental regulations on the global value chain position of Chinese firms is studied in depth, using the cleaner production standards promulgated and implemented by the Chinese government in 2003 as a quasi-natural experiment, taking a time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The data sources employed include the Cleaner Production Standard Implementation Industry Directory, the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), the China Industrial Enterprise Database, and the China Customs Import and Export Database. This research discovered the following: First, adopting cleaner production standards significantly improves Chinese enterprises' positions in the global value chain-a conclusion that holds up to a number of robustness tests. Second, in terms of firm size, capital intensity, ownership characteristics, and government subsidies, there exists a noticeable heterogeneity in the promotion of the adoption of cleaner production standards for the improvement of Chinese enterprises' global value chain position. Third, the implementation of cleaner production standards stimulates the upgrading of Chinese enterprises' global value chain position, primarily through the entry and exit impacts, product-switching effect, and innovation compensation effect. The following proposals for policy can be implemented in light of the findings of this paper: upstream prevention strategies in the development of future environmental protection and trade policies should be advocated; nuanced and stratified environmental policies should be meticulously constructed; a mix of policies should be employed to bolster the institutional support for green environmental regulations; the integration of environmental governance into the evaluation framework should be emphasized; the creation of an innovation-oriented environmental governance system should be expedited. In conclusion, the findings of this research provide empirical evidence on the role of environmental regulations in coordinating ecological development and strengthening the position of Chinese enterprises in global value chains, which may assist other developing nations in making the transition to a path of high-quality growth.","[Huang, Jingjing; Zhong, Yuan; Zhang, Yabin] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Zhong, Y (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",jingjinghuang@hnu.edu.cn; yuan_zhong@hnu.edu.cn,,,"Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China [18ZDA068]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72203058]; Project of Philosophy and Social Science in Hunan Province [22JD009]; Natural Science Foundation in Hunan Province [2021JJ30156]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M701164, 2022T150204]",Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Philosophy and Social Science in Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation in Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported by the Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China (grant number 18ZDA068), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 72203058), the Project of Philosophy and Social Science in Hunan Province (grant number 22JD009), the Natural Science Foundation in Hunan Province (grant number 2021JJ30156), and a project funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M701164, 2022T150204).

This adds to the complexity of managing interorganizational relationships and poses a question regarding corporate ability to effectively leverage suppliers over environmental and social performance of supplied goods. Since it is not clear what type of purchasing relationship is more favorable for greening a product supply, the current paper aims to investigate how food retailers manage their relationships with suppliers in order to influence the environmental and social performance of procured goods and improve the availability of sustainably produced supply. The research is based on two case studies of Swedish supermarkets and supplementary semi-structured interviews with Swedish, British and Danish supermarkets. The results of the study contribute to the existing body of academic knowledge in the field of sustainable supply chain management by developing a typology of sustainable purchasing relationships with detailed insights into the nature of collaborative practices, structure of incentives, sustainability ambition, and approaches to verification of compliance. The study has also revealed the dependence of sustainable purchasing relationships on the characteristics of the procurement context, namely the presence of well-established sustainability certification schemes, perceived by purchaser's situation with availability of sustainability certified supply and purchaser's interpretation of the state of power dependence in relationships with suppliers.

But despite this rhetoric, corporations regularly fall short in their conduct. This is especially true in supply chains where a number of human rights abuses frequently occur. One solution is for corporations to engage in meaningful human rights due diligence that involves monitoring human rights, reporting on social and environmental performance, undertaking impact assessments, and consulting with groups whose human rights they can harm. The challenge is how to encourage corporations to make these changes. We often rely on two types of tools to improve corporate compliance: legal institutions and reputational mechanisms. However, each of these faces significant limitations when it comes to human rights compliance in the supply chain. This Article develops a strategy based on complementarity between the two so that each compensates for the limitations of the other. Specifically, reputational mechanisms can help create incentives for compliance with international legal institutions with weak or absent enforcement mechanisms. Alternatively, legal institutions can create focal points regarding corporate best practices that can improve reputational markets for corporate social responsibility. The reputational typology developed in this Article offers three important contributions to policy and academic discussions concerning corporate misconduct. First, it allows us to create better human rights institutions by revealing the types of carrots and sticks that we should include to encourage corporate cooperation; this lesson is particularly timely because an international treaty on business and human rights is in development. Second, this typology illustrates how corporations may voluntarily undertake organizational change in response to a reputational crisis. Finally, this typology identifies drivers of cross-border compliance for transnational corporations.","[Parella, Kishanthi] Washington & Lee Univ, Sch Law, Lexington, VA 24450 USA",Washington & Lee University,"Parella, K (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Sch Law, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",,,,,,,,188,12,12,0,13,,,,0745-3515,,,,,,2020,95,2,,,,,727,793,,,,,,,Law,,Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To answer this problem, the Indonesian government implemented a strategy through certification which ensured the achievement of sustainability standards, especially on the upstream side of the palm oil supply chain. The implementation of Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) was an ultimate instrument that applied in particular to smallholders oriented towards managing land legal issues, plantation business licenses, plant seeds, and environmental management and to farmer organizations at the local level. However, this process faced quite complex challenges in the form of structural barriers that are very constraining. This study revealed the occurrence of the phenomenon of hollow governance when regulations are absent or collide with each other. The study also revealed institutional power and multi-level governance that made the governance process ineffective or counterproductive. With a qualitative approach to research conducted in three important palm oil provinces of Indonesia, this article aims to look at the issues of oil palm governance a bit more comprehensively. The study conceptualized what was referred to as low-functioning governance to describe how weak the institutions, organizations, actors, and resources are that support ISPO implementation, especially at the regional and local levels. This paper suggests improving and strengthening the ISPO oil palm governance if Indonesian palm oil companies and smallholders want to gain better credibility on sustainability abroad.","[Putri, Eka Intan Kumala] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Resource & Environm Econ, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Dharmawan, Arya Hadi; Yulian, Bayu Eka; Amalia, Rizka; Kinseng, Rilus A.; Tonny, Fredian] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Commun & Community Dev Sci, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Hospes, Otto] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hospes, Otto] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Human Ecol, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Yulian, Bayu Eka; Mardiyaningsih, Dyah Ita; Rahmadian, Faris] Bogor Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Studies, Bogor 16129, Indonesia; [Tonny, Fredian] Bogor Agr Univ, Tani Ctr, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Pramudya, Eusebius Pantja] Univ Prasetiya Mulya, Sch Business & Econ, Bsd City 15339, Tangerang, Indonesia; [Suradiredja, Diah Y.] Kehati Fdn, Jakarta 12720, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Wageningen University & Research; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University,"Putri, EIK (corresponding author), Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Resource & Environm Econ, Bogor 16680, Indonesia.",ekaintan@apps.ipb.ac.id; adharma@apps.ipb.ac.id; otto.hospes@wur.nl; bayueka@apps.ipb.ac.id; amalrizka@apps.ipb.ac.id; dyahita@apps.ipb.ac.id; rilus@apps.ipb.ac.id; frediantonny@apps.ipb.ac.id; eusebius.pramudya@lecturer.prasetiyamulya.ac.id; faris_rahmadian@apps.ipb.ac.id; diah.y.suradiredja@kehati.or.id,,,Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom Government through Strengthening Palm Oil Sustainability Indonesia Project [300187],Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom Government through Strengthening Palm Oil Sustainability Indonesia Project,This research was funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom Government through Strengthening Palm Oil Sustainability Indonesia Project under the grant number of 300187.,,58,15,16,7,23,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1820,10.3390/su14031820,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031820,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, its environmental, social, and economic sustainability is increasingly called into question. The depletion of soil health, biodiversity loss, high carbon emissions, and the marginalisation of small farmers highlight the unsustainability of this model. A growing movement of farmers, millers, and bakers from across Europe are beginning to find collaborative ways around these problems by creating territorially-situated networks to govern the use of genetically diverse and/or ecologically produced and processed grains. However, these emergent 'alternative grain networks' (AGNs) remain poorly understood, especially in terms of their use of novel governance structures, economic arrangements, and their scaling potential. This article presents and systematically analyses three AGN case studies from across Europe. Using an adapted four-part 'food as a commons' framework, we assess each case to understand the genesis of these initiatives and their constituent elements; namely, who are the actors involved, what motivates them, and how governance is being enacted. Our analysis revealed several important aspects which we believe must be considered in the development of AGNs as collaborative initiatives. We argue that the AGN initiatives' capacity to collaborate is based on a process of creating a 'commons for food', not only including material resources and sector-specific knowledge, but also the tools of governance in territorial supply chains. Beyond material resources and sector-specific knowledge, shared values and governance tools in territorial supply chains must also be recognised and governed as shared resources to ensure AGNs deliver collective benefits, but also a sustainable and equitable grain system in the long term.","[Maughan, Chris] Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience CAWR, Coventry, England; [Belletti, Giovanni; Marescotti, Andrea; Mengoni, Matteo] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Balazs, Balint; Lazanyi, Orsolya] Environm Social Sci Res Grp ESSRG, Budapest, Hungary",Coventry University; University of Florence,"Maughan, C (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience CAWR, Coventry, England.;Mengoni, M (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy.",chris.maughan@coventry.ac.uk; matteo.mengoni@unifi.it,,,European Union [101000918],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant number 101000918, project entitled: 'Collaborative Agri-food Chains: Driving Innovation in Territorial Food Systems and Improving Outcomes for Producers and Consumers' or the'COACH project'.",,68,0,0,3,3,,,,,2193-7532,,,,MAR 5,2025,13,1,,,,,,,9,10.1186/s40100-025-00352-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40100-025-00352-y,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,,Agriculture; Business & Economics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examines how AI contributes to enhancing corporate ESG outcomes, using China's national AI pilot zones as a quasi-natural experiment. By applying a staggered difference-in-differences approach to panel data from 1418 A-share listed firms in China (2011-2022), we find that AI significantly improves ESG performance. The primary mechanism behind this improvement is better corporate information governance, which includes improved information transparency, enhanced information sharing, and reduced information asymmetry. These improvements, in turn, lead to improved environmental information disclosures, optimized supply chain management, and reduced agency costs. Private firms, as well as firms with lower institutional attention and higher equity concentration, experience a greater positive effect. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms through which AI influences corporate ESG performance, emphasizing the potential of AI to strengthen corporate governance and support sustainability efforts.","[Zhou, Xiaoyong; Li, Gaochao] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Business, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaoyong] Guilin Univ Aerosp Technol, Coll Management, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qunwei; Zhou, Dequn] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China; [Li, Yangganxuan] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Guilin University of Electronic Technology; Guilin University of Aerospace Technology; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Wuhan University of Technology,"Wang, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.",wqw0305@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72064005]; Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project [22BGL003]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province [2020GXNSFAA159041]; GUAT Special Research Project on the Strategic Development of Distinctive Interdisciplinary Fields [TS2024311],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province); GUAT Special Research Project on the Strategic Development of Distinctive Interdisciplinary Fields,"We appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72064005) , Guangxi Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project (No. 22BGL003) , Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province (No. 2020GXNSFAA159041) , and GUAT Special Research Project on the Strategic Development of Distinctive Interdisciplinary Fields (No. TS2024311) .

Focusing on the supplier perspective and specifically on the role of psychological mechanisms at the supplier level, the authors adopt the stimulus-organism-response framework from functionalist psychology to investigate the mediating role of environment-related supplier perceived relationship value in the association between ESD, in the form of environmental requirements and audits (indirect development - ID) vs. direct development projects (direct development - DD), and supplier EMC.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used structural equation modeling and regression analysis to test the hypotheses using survey data from 221 supplying organizations in China.FindingsResults reveal that each of the three considered dimensions of the environment-related supplier perceived relationship value (i.e. economic, strategic and co-creation) helps enhance EMC. However, while DD influences positively all three dimensions, ID has a positive effect on only the economic and strategic dimensions. Moreover, the mediation analysis suggests that, while DD affects EMC both directly and via the three dimensions of environment-related supplier perceived relationship value (partial mediation), ID affects EMC only through its impact on environment-related supplier perceived relationship economic and strategic value (full mediation).Originality/valueThe study sheds light on the psychological mechanisms that drive suppliers' involvement in green supplier development activities. By doing so, it contributes to the understanding of ESD practices and processes and their effectiveness.","[Qiao, Jianqi; Li, Suicheng] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Capaldo, Antonio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management, Naples, Italy",Xi'an University of Technology; University of Naples Federico II,"Capaldo, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management, Naples, Italy.",1170510005@stu.xaut.edu.cn; lisc@xaut.edu.cn; antonio.capaldo@unina.it,,,Xi'an University of Technology Faculty Doctoral Research Start-up Project [105-256082426]; National Social Science Fund of China [23BGL073]; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2023R020],Xi'an University of Technology Faculty Doctoral Research Start-up Project; National Social Science Fund of China; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province,"The authors contributed equally to the paper.

The implementation of carbon cap and dual credit regulations has altered the competitive environment and strategy of conventional vehicles (CV) and NEV, and has attracted extensive scholarly attention. However, the collaborative governance of the two regulations is relatively limited. This paper constructs two stylized production models based on Cournot game to examine the impacts of different combinations of two regulations, including no regulatory intervention (NC, ND), consideration of dual credit regulation without carbon cap regulation (NC, D), consideration of carbon cap regulation without dual credit regulation (C, ND), and consideration of both regulations (C, D), on vehicle production decisions, and determine the optimal regulatory scheme and intervention intensity under varying conditions. The Lagrange functions and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimization conditions are employed to solve for the optimal CV and NEV production decisions. The results show that carbon cap regulation not only reduces carbon emissions but also expands the NEV market size. Different regulatory combinations are applicable in different contexts, while collaborative efforts between carbon cap and dual credit regulation can enhance social, economic, and environmental potential within the auto industry under specific conditions. These findings provide important theoretical guidance for expanding NEV market and improving government intervention mechanism.","[Liu, Li] Henan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhe] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi] Henan Univ Technol, Informat Management Ctr, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Henan University of Technology; Nanjing Audit University; Henan University of Technology,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China.",sunshineli@tju.edu.cn; wangzhe@nau.edu.cn; zc@haut.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72102112]; Soft Science Research Project of Henan Province [242400410118]; Henan University of Technology High-level Talents Scientific Research Fund [32400482]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [22GLC020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Soft Science Research Project of Henan Province; Henan University of Technology High-level Talents Scientific Research Fund; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province,"The authors are grateful to the editors and anonymous reviewers who provided valuable comments and suggestions to significantly improve the quality of the paper.

The selection of a suitable supplier is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem based on a number of qualitative, quantitative, and even conflicting criteria. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel MCDM approach dedicated to the supplier evaluation problem using an ordered fuzzy decision making system. This study uses a fuzzy inference system based on IF-THEN rules with ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs). The approach employs the concept of OFNs to account for potential uncertainty and subjectivity in the decision making process, and it also takes into account the trends of changes in assessment values and entropy in the final supplier evaluation. This paper's principal contribution is the development of a knowledge base and the demonstration of its application in an ordered fuzzy expert system for multi-criteria supplier evaluation in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The proposed system takes into account the dynamic changes in the value of assessment parameters in the overall supplier assessment, allowing for the differentiation of suppliers based on current and historical data. The utilization of OFNs in a fuzzy model then allows for a reduction in the complexity of the knowledge base in comparison to a classical fuzzy system and makes it more accessible to users, as it requires only basic arithmetic operations in the inference process. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the assessment of suppliers against a range of criteria, including local hiring, completeness, and defect factors. Furthermore, the potential to integrate sustainability and ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) criteria in the assessment process adds value to the decision making framework by adapting to current trends in supply chain management.","[Rudnik, Katarzyna] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Prod Engn & Logist, PL-45758 Opole, Poland; [Chwastyk, Anna] Opole Univ Technol, Ctr Educ & Applicat Math, PL-45758 Opole, Poland; [Pisz, Iwona] Univ Opole, Fac Econ, PL-45040 Opole, Poland",Opole University of Technology; Opole University of Technology; University of Opole,"Rudnik, K (corresponding author), Opole Univ Technol, Fac Prod Engn & Logist, PL-45758 Opole, Poland.",k.rudnik@po.edu.pl; a.chwastyk@po.edu.pl; ipisz@uni.opole.pl,,,,,,,87,1,1,20,20,,,,,1099-4300,,,,OCT,2024,26,10,,,,,,,860,10.3390/e26100860,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e26100860,,,,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",,Physics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data on subsidiaries were collated through systematic searching for countries' supply chain activities in documents and web pages. Cross-sectional multiple regression analysis was used to assess the association between the number of agricultural and manufacturing TTLCs and the Tobacco Industry Interference score, and the degree to which these were mediated by tobacco control, good governance, and economic importance of tobacco.Results TTLC supply chain activity had global reach. As the number of TTLCs with tobacco growing and manufacturing activities rose, interference increased significantly. Interference was associated with poorer tobacco control. The association with more TTLCs undertaking final product manufacturing was related to higher-value tobacco exports but was not related to tobacco making a bigger contribution to the economy.Conclusions TTLCs continue to control the global tobacco supply chain through their globe-spanning subsidiaries. The presence of TTLCs in a country is associated with political interference. Countries should consider their participation in the tobacco supply chain alongside the understanding that they are likely to cede political power to TTLCs, potentially undermining the health of their populations.Implications Tobacco control research has traditionally concentrated on the demand side of tobacco. Our results lend support to calls for more research on the supply of tobacco. Governments should require tobacco companies to provide detailed, up-to-date information in an easily accessible format on in-country supply chain activities. Policymakers should take the likelihood of political interference in health and environmental policy into account when making decisions about foreign direct investment offered by the tobacco industry.","[Hiscock, Rosemary; Alaouie, Hala; Matthes, Britta K.; Mehegan, John; Bloomfield, Michael J.] Univ Bath, Dept Hlth, Tobacco Control Res Grp, Bath, England; [Alaouie, Hala; Bloomfield, Michael J.] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath, England; [Matthes, Britta K.; Bloomfield, Michael J.] Univ Bath, Ctr Dev Studies, Bath, England",University of Bath; University of Bath; University of Bath,"Hiscock, R (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Hlth, Tobacco Control Res Grp, Bath, England.",r.hiscock@bath.ac.uk,,,Bloomberg Philanthropies as part of STOP,Bloomberg Philanthropies as part of STOP,"This study was supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies as part of STOP.

Amidst intensifying market competition, crafting a sustainable supply chain for overseas expansion has become an indispensable core element for driving corporate internationalization. This study focuses on the sustainability generation mechanism of the overseas supply chain of Chinese pre-cooked meal A-share listed companies, employing the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method. Herein, an in-depth analysis of 388 data points from 17 listed companies has been conducted. The study systematically reveals the key factors affecting the sustainability of overseas supply chains and identifies three critical sustainability generation paths: the technology-driven and norm compliance model (path 1), the market sensitivity and product innovation model (path 2), and the robust operation and risk control model (path 3). The present study not only introduces a novel perspective on the application of a TOE framework within the realms of sustainable supply chain management and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria but also offers clear directions for companies to enhance sustainability in their overseas expansion process. This includes strengthening technological research and development, compliance construction, market adaptability, product diversity, infrastructure construction, and risk management.

The role of international market demand for commodities such as soy in causing those problems is clear, yet they remain mostly unaddressed. Therefore, European countries have led a new global trend on mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence (HREDD), advancing the EU's growing global regulatory ambitions. Here, we analyse the prospects for successful externalisation of Europe's sustainability standards - a 'Brussels Effect' - using Brazilian soy as a case. Our analysis exposes how the practice of supply chain divergence (i.e., the segmentation of exports tailored to different consumer requirements) can easily evade policy impacts and negate their additionality where Europe commands a minor market share. To avoid becoming just a niche market in these cases, the EU would need to expand on its actions, (i) engaging with other major consumer countries to export its standards, (ii) doubling down on HREDD's coverage to include financial actors and companies trading with other markets, or (iii) moving beyond 'do no harm' policies to adopt more strategically targeted 'do good' instruments to counter drivers of deforestation on the landscape level.","[Lima, Mairon G.

Based on data from 508 manufacturing companies from 2013 to 2022, this research utilizes SCIA in the framework of a quasi-natural experiment, employing research methods DID, EM, PSM-DID, and SDID to evaluate the effect of the SCIA on SDP. Through empirical evidence, it concludes that the rollout or enforcement of the SCIA pilot policy significantly promotes SDP. SCIA impacts corporate sustainable development by increasing their intention to invest in innovation, ensuring the sustainability of corporate innovation, and reducing company cost expenditures. There is significant heterogeneity in the effectiveness of establishing pilot cities for the digitization and application of supply chain innovations: the pilot policy can significantly promote the SDP of state-owned enterprises; compared to small-scale companies, the SDP of large companies has been significantly improved due to the pilot policy; SCIA pilot policies have a greater impact on SDP of low agency cost companies than high agency cost companies; and companies located in cities with a high degree of digitalization are more favorable impacts from the pilot policy. Companies with weak monopoly power have a more significant improvement in SDP. The study enriches the research on the effectiveness of SCIA pilot policies and provides insights into how local governments can facilitate the enhancement of the SDP of manufacturing companies.","[Chen, Ming; Tan, Xin] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 99 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266061, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jianhua] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, 2,Wenhua West Rd, Weihai 264209, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Rebecca Kechen] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, Management Discipline, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",Qingdao University of Science & Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Technology Sydney,"Zhu, JH (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, 2,Wenhua West Rd, Weihai 264209, Shandong, Peoples R China.",jianhuamath@163.com,,,,,,,114,0,0,11,11,,,,,2662-9992,,,,MAR 4,2025,12,1,,,,,,,307,10.1057/s41599-025-04601-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-025-04601-9,,,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, governments and non-state actors have responded through various governance initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable commodity production. While the existing literature focuses largely on transnational standards originating in the North, we investigate homegrown approaches in the South by asking: what explains variation in the design and features of sustainable commodity governance led by Southern actors? By comparing sustainable aquaculture governance in Thailand, Vietnam, and China, we derive a novel conceptualization of two distinct types of homegrown governance approaches - certification standards and capability-building programs - and suggest that the choice between the two is contingent on the supply of, and demand for, sustainable commodity governance. We find decisions by Southern governments to supply governance can lock in top-down approaches and exclude potentially more impactful bottom-up approaches. We therefore argue that the material resources and normative concerns of Southern governance entrepreneurs lead to different homegrown approaches. Our findings contribute theoretical insights to the literature on transnational governance interactions and practical observations about the utility of different approaches to sustainability concerns in the Global South.","[Sun, Yixian] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [van der Ven, Hamish] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Leacock Bulletin Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [van der Ven, Hamish] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Leacock Bulletin Room 414,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",Yale University; McGill University; McGill University,"Sun, YX (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",yixian.sun@yale.edu; hamish.vanderven@mcgill.ca,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [162177],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [Doc.CH Grant 162177].,,66,25,25,4,20,,,,0921-8009,1873-6106,,,,JAN,2020,167,,,,,,,,106445,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106445,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106445,,,,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of two cross-industrial studies in Norway and Spain indicate that the TBL's economic element has a direct effect on the environmental element, with the social element mediating this effect.

Network and chain approaches in the emerging field of Environmental Economic Geography are combined with the notion of social metabolism to conceptualize the entanglement of environmental and economic processes as well as socio-environmental inequalities entailed in recycling networks. The analysis reveals the impact that the heterogeneity and fluctuation of plastic waste supply has on the economic organization of recycling networks, giving rise to distinct forms of governance in its intermediate and down-stream segments. Such an integrated perspective also serves to explain why environmental upgrading is hard to achieve under prevailing circumstances by plastic recyclers in Kolkata.

A first draft of the Oiconomy system,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,Article,,,,,,LCA; Externalities; Sustainability measuring standard; Eco social cost units; EcoCosts; Certification,POLLUTION PREVENTION; CLEANER PRODUCTION; SUSTAINABILITY; GOVERNANCE; DIFFUSION; EMA,"A major part of global unsustainability is embedded in consumption and the processes involved in the lifecycle of products, but there is currently no comprehensive and objective method for product sustainability measurement, including both environmental and social issues. This requires a life cycle approach. Current life cycle assessment (LCA) systems, developed to compare environmental performance of products and production alternatives, have many shortcomings if used to comprehensively measure product sustainability. The most important shortcomings are: the lack of a measuring standard, the top-down approach, the weighting of different issues, the very laborious procedures of addressing specific supply chains, limitation to environmental aspects' the very complex nature of impact based data, and difficult database maintenance. This article presents a new type of bottom-up and product-specific LCA for the comprehensive measurement of the hidden environmental and social costs of products. Every supply chain actor collects the upstream supply chain hidden costs, calculates and adds its own contribution and transfers the result to the next link by means of a monetary unit, the Eco Social Cost Unit (ESCU). Every ESCU allocation is the product of a quantitative factor for an issue and a price factor. The uniform measurement of the quantitative factor, their transfer through the supply chain, and the creation of a self learning database of the price factors is achieved by means of a standard. The price factor represents the marginal preventative costs for the relative impact category of sustainability issues. For initial determination of the price factor this article extends the EcoCost/Value ratio system, developed by Vogtlander et al., to social issues, discusses implications of the system, its principles, advantages, research challenges and limitations and proposes system boundaries for application of the system and future research contributions to the project.

However, how the policy affected the air pollutant emissions remains poorly understood. We compared the air pollutant emissions between decommissioned and newly-built CFPPs under the PBQSP by developing a plant-level supply chain emission inventory model, taking Shandong, China's top provincial-level coal power producer, as the case area. The results indicated that compared to a 27.4% increase in electricity produced in Shandong from 2010 to 2014, the NOx, particulate matter (PM), Hg, and SO2 emissions disproportionately increased by 10.3%, 11.7%, 11.8% and 0.5%, respectively. It was found that the PBQSP policy has made great contribution to air pollution mitigation, as the supply chain emission intensities (emissions per kilowatt-hour) of NOX, PM, Hg and SO2 of the newly-built CFPPs are three-quarters, two-fifths, three-fifths, and four-fifths lower, respectively, than those of the decommissioned CFPPs. However, coal transport route changes caused an increase in NOX, PM, and SO2 emissions by 44.0%, 45.5%, and 55.6%, respectively, during the transportation stage, which offset the PBQSP overall mitigation effect. By building a comprehensive assessment framework for air pollutant control policies, our study provides insights for formulating coordinated mitigation measures for the pollutant-intensive industries, such as promoting efficient air pollutant control technologies including the spray dust suppression devices.","[Wang, Wenxin; Zou, Xiaowei; Li, Jiashuo] Shandong Univ, Inst Blue & Green Dev, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fan] Inha Univ, Program Ind Secur Governance, Incheon 402751, South Korea; [Guo, Yaqin; Zhou, Sili] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, State Key Lab Coal Combust, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin] Fudan Univ, Fudan Tyndall Ctr, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Inha University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Fudan University,"Li, JS (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Inst Blue & Green Dev, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China.",lijiashuo@sdu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Fund of China, China [21ZDA065, 72074137, 72074138, 72022009]; Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province, China; ; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [ZR2020MG067, ZR2021YQ27]","National Social Science Fund of China, China; Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province, China; ; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province)","This study is supported by National Social Science Fund of China, China (21ZDA065) ; National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (72074137, 72074138 & 72022009) ; Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province, China; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (ZR2020MG067& ZR2021YQ27) .",,41,13,14,8,61,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,JUL 1,2022,313,,,,,,,,114960,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114960,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114960,,APR 2022,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In global development policy and discourse, the concept of inclusive business has become central in efforts to resolve these tensions, with the idea that integrating smallholders and other disadvantaged actors into partnerships with agribusiness firms can generate benefits for national economies, private investors, and local livelihoods. Scholarly treatment of the topic has tended to be polarized into win/lose narratives, or points to the contingency and social differentiation of localized experiences. This review paper takes a different approach, exploring published evidence on the structural factors shaping agricultural value chains and their implications for social inclusion. We develop a typology of seven agricultural value chains, and use this to select a sample of crops in specific world regions for an analysis of how structural factors in value chain relations - from crop features, to market dynamics and policy drivers - affect social inclusion (and exclusion). Such an approach allows us to ask whether inclusive agribusiness is a realistic goal given the broader structuring of agribusiness and the global economic system. Our study finds that while the characteristics of specific crops and supply chains exert a strong influence on opportunities and constraints to inclusion, the overall trend is towards more exclusive agribusiness as governments scale back support to smallholders, more stringent standards raise barriers to entry, and firms streamline operations to enhance competitiveness. This raises questions about the feasibility of this goal under the current political economic system. Findings point to the need to reconsider the policy choices behind these trends, and how we deploy the fiscal, legislative, and gatekeeper functions of the state to shape agrarian trajectories.

Such uncertainties profoundly affect corporate operations and pose significant challenges to their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Therefore, using data from Chinese A-share listed corporations from 2009 to 2021, we empirically analyze the impact of the EU on ESG performance. The results demonstrate that the EU significantly negatively impacts ESG performance, indicating that corporations frequently find it difficult to implement and maintain high-standard ESG policies and practices effectively. Additionally, they reveal that the EU inhibits the improvement of ESG performance by increasing corporate financing constraints (KZ). Lastly, this study explores the role of government subsidies (GOV), investor attention (IA), and geopolitical risks (GPR) as moderating variables. We discover that GOV can mitigate the negative impact of the EU on KZ because they provide additional resources that help corporations maintain their ESG in uncertain environments. Furthermore, IA can reduce the adverse impact of KZ on ESG. Positive moderating effects result from ESG issues; the capital they provide effectively reduces corporate KZ, thus enabling corporations to maintain good ESG performance despite operating in highly uncertain environments. However, due to the increased asymmetry of information in economic markets caused by geopolitical tensions, GPR exacerbates the negative impact of the EU on ESG performance, thus leading to an increase in KZ.

Managing Social Standards in First- and Second-Tier Suppliers,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,,,,Article,,,,,,Sustainable supply chain management; Textile industry; Agency theory; Stewardship theory; Auditing; Social and environmental standards,CHAIN MANAGEMENT; AGENCY THEORY; ORGANIZATIONAL ECONOMICS; GOVERNANCE; ETHICS; RESPONSIBILITY; COLLABORATION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; LEADERSHIP,"Buyer-supplier relationships are often framed as principal-agent relationships, based on contractual arrangements that temporarily align the goals of both parties. The underlying notion is that the relationship between buyers and suppliers is adversarial in nature and that the supplier, acting in the role of the agent, will take advantage of the principal if not sufficiently controlled. We propose that there is empirically also another type of partnership which reflects the propositions of stewardship theory. According to this theory, suppliers are motivated to work autonomously towards contractually agreed objectives. We analyse how the agency and stewardship theories differ regarding their descriptions of autonomy, motivation, identification, authority, stakeholder orientation and short- versus long-term collaboration. We analyse the case of a first-tier supplier and four second-tier suppliers situated in Turkey in the area of Istanbul which collaborate with the aim of improving their social and environmental performance. The results show that the relationship between the partners in this case has become more collaborative over time and can now be described in terms of stewardship theory rather than in terms of agency theory. We conclude that the distinction between agency and stewardship relationships is empirically meaningful in the context of supplier-buyer relationships and adds a new aspect to our understanding of how to achieve more sustainable supply chains.","[Asslaender, Michael S.] Tech Univ Dresden, Int Grad Sch Zittau, Dept Social Sci, Markt 23, D-02763 Zittau, Germany; [Roloff, Julia] ESC Rennes, Management & Org, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Nayir, Dilek Zamantili] Marmara Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Business Adm German Language, TR-34810 Istanbul, Turkey",Technische Universitat Dresden; Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business; Marmara University,"Roloff, J (corresponding author), ESC Rennes, Management & Org, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel, F-35065 Rennes, France.",masslaender@ihi-zittau.de; julia.roloff@esc-rennes.com; dznayir@marmara.edu.tr,,,,,,,83,42,54,3,61,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,DEC,2016,139,4,,,SI,,661,683,,10.1007/s10551-016-3148-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-016-3148-0,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet leakage-when deforestation is pushed to other regions-may dilute the global effectiveness of regionally successful policies. Here we show that domestic leakage offsets 43-50% of the avoided deforestation induced by existing and proposed zero-deforestation supply chain policies in Brazil's soy sector. However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (< 3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%. Thus, if major tropical commodity importers (e.g., the EU) require traders to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, it could help bend the curve on global forest loss.","[Villoria, Nelson] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Garrett, Rachael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Environm Policy Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrett, Rachael] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Garrett, Rachael] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Conservat Initiat, Cambridge, England; [Gollnow, Florian] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Carlson, Kimberly] NYU, Dept Environm Studies, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Carlson, Kimberly] Univ Hawaii, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Kansas State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Boston University; New York University; University of Hawaii System,"Villoria, N (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nvilloria@ksu.edu,,,"US National Science Foundation [1739253]; US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW01136-H, HAW01146-M]; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - U.S. National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875]; NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program [80NSSC18K0315]; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [S1072, 2020-67023-30970]; Kansas State University Open Access Publishing Fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1739253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - U.S. National Science Foundation; NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Kansas State University Open Access Publishing Fund; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Authors acknowledge funding from US National Science Foundation grant # 1739253 (N.V., R.G., K.C., F.G.), US Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project HAW01136-H (K.C.), McIntire Stennis Project HAW01146-M, managed by the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (K.C.), National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) - U.S. National Science Foundation award DBI-1052875 (N.V., R.G., K.C., F.G.), NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program (Grant # 80NSSC18K0315) (F.G.), U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Multistate Research Project S1072 (N.V.) and Grant # 2020-67023-30970.

The construction industry is considered as one sector most vulnerable to modern slavery. This research aims to identify the policies, systems and processes that will affect an organisation's approach to modern slavery risk and propose a framework for assessing the readiness of entities in the construction industry to address modern slavery in their operations and supply chains. Semi-structured interviews were used as the main research method to glean industry experts' insights and perspectives on key themes and topics. The research finds that a successful modern slavery approach includes governance, risk assessment and ongoing due diligence, risk mitigation, grievance and remediation, performance monitoring and reporting, and education and capability building. This paper details the first academic research examining the implications of modern slavery legislation on construction businesses in Australia. The research contributes to existing body of knowledge by highlighting issues and concerns specific to modern slavery in an organisation's operation and supply chains. Focusing on the construction industry, this research opens up a dialogue on taking sector specific approach in modern slavery risk detection and remediation. The research results offer practical reference for entities in the construction industry to plan, formulate and implement policies, systems, and processes to identify and mitigate modern slavery risk, so as to satisfy legislative requirements and to achieve social sustainability goals.

Instead of imposing wide ranging global standards commonly applied through gold standard certification systems, LV helps domestic governments enforce their own laws. Three processes help explain why Indonesia (as a producer), China (as a manufacturer) and the United States (as a consumer) moved, in the 2000s, from lukewarm interest or opposition to formalized support: how triggers enabled by economic interdependence are pulled; how ceding of instrument/process state sovereignty may reinforce substantive sovereignty; and historical institutional processes that shift organizational interests and problem definitions. Looking backward, the empirical results are consistent with a Delaware effect in which economic globalization is asserted to lead to a ratcheting down of environmental and social standards. Looking forward, we theorize about, and identify the conditions through which, widespread coalitions in support of the institution of LV, may pave the way for a ratcheting up process that is consistent with, but nuances, Vogel's California effect.","[Cashore, Benjamin; Stone, Michael W.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Cashore, B (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Room 225,Kroon Hall,195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",benjamin.cashore@yale.edu,,,,,,,98,68,73,0,22,,,,1748-5983,1748-5991,,,,MAR,2014,8,1,,,,,49,73,,10.1111/rego.12053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rego.12053,,,,Law; Political Science; Public Administration,,Government & Law; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Motivation: Even with government support such as subsidies, the operation of CLSC still requires immense investment, such as purchasing recycling equipment. Nevertheless, the unprecedented economic recession during the post-pandemic era has heightened the risk of insufficient funding for CLSC. This highlights the importance of understanding the complexities involved in CLSC financing strategies, as they are crucial for ensuring the sustainability and resilience of CLSC in the face of challenges. Methods: To investigate the equilibrium decisions and financing strategy selection of CLSCs, we developed and analyzed a series of three-stage Stackelberg models, considering practical scenarios involving capital constraints, environmentally friendly green activities, government subsidies for End-of-Life (EOL) recycling, as well as introducing common trade credit financing and bank financing for generality. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate: (1) Under trade credit financing, it is always beneficial for the collector granting credit. Interest income can motivate the collector to recover more EOL products. (2) In addition to financing interest rates, government subsidies and remanufacturing cost savings can affect the financing strategy selection of the capital-constrained manufacturer. Our study provides guidance for managers in selecting optimal financing strategies under specific conditions. (3) The total profit of CLSC under trade credit financing is always higher and we propose a revenue-sharing contract to realize the win-win status with the optimal profit of CLSC. (4) Furthermore, our results underscore the importance of government recycling subsidies, remanufacturing cost savings, and the positive impact achieved by reducing recycling difficulties and enhancing customer awareness of green consumption.","[Chen, Jianhui; Chan, Felix T.

Data were collected through a survey of 235 upper-level managers in the Brazilian agribusiness sector. A two-step analytical approach was applied, with cluster analysis identifying groups exhibiting distinct patterns regarding sustainability engagement (Very Sustainable and Low-Sustainable), followed by logistic regression, which singled out six key predictors among 28 variables, namely avoiding non-sustainable materials, repurposing by-products, fostering a shared CE vision, adhering to ethical guidelines, ensuring financial transparency, and fair labor practices. The final model achieved 83.4% accuracy, underscoring how an integrated approach to sustainability enhances corporate reputation. Considering its theoretical contributions, this study extends the NRBV and RV theories by demonstrating that CE strategies, CE-oriented collaborative relationships, and ESG performance strengthen pollution prevention initiatives, sustainable product development efforts, and trust among partners, among other achievements, thereby enhancing firms' reputation and sustainable performance. Methodologically, the study integrates cluster analysis and predictive modeling to assess sustainability's impact on reputation. From a managerial perspective, findings emphasize that corporate reputation benefits from circularity, governance integrity, and stakeholder engagement. However, the cross-sectional design, industry-specific sample, and reliance on self-reported data limit generalizability. Future research should adopt longitudinal and cross-industry approaches, examining regulatory shifts, technological advances, and evolving stakeholder demands in the sustainability-reputation nexus while incorporating external data sources to assess variations across institutional and cultural settings.","[Barbosa, Marcelo Werneck] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Bronzo, Marcelo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Adm Sci, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [Torres Junior, Noel] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Prod Engn, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, Brazil; [de Sousa, Paulo Renato] Fundacao Dom Cabral, Campus Belo Horizonte, BR-30140083 Belo Horizonte, Brazil",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Barbosa, MW (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",marcelo.werneck@uc.cl; marcelobronzo@face.ufmg.br; noel@face.ufmg.br; paulorenato@fdc.org.br,,,,,,,89,0,0,0,0,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR 27,2025,17,7,,,,,,,2969,10.3390/su17072969,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17072969,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

By exploring participation factors, sustainable practices, challenges, economic impacts, and social benefits, this study seeks to provide a thorough understanding of SFSCs. Addressing gaps in existing research, the review aims to guide policymakers and practitioners in fostering sustainable, resilient, and inclusive local food systems. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 92 research articles was conducted following a well-defined research protocol. Findings: The review revealed that factors driving the adoption of SFSCs include increasing consumer demand for local and sustainable products, resilience-building in the food system, and environmental concerns. The SFSC supply chain was categorized into four critical stages: food sourcing and production, processing, aggregation, and distribution and review examined the sustainable practices at each stage. However, challenges such as information asymmetry, lack of infrastructure, regulatory barriers, and market dynamics hinder the full potential of SFSCs. Economically, SFSCs contribute to local economic development and empowerment of small-scale producers, while also showing promise in reducing environmental footprints and fostering community engagement. Research implications: The study identifies several research avenues to further advance the understanding of SFSCs. Future research should delve into consumer behavior and attitudes towards SFSCs, analyze the full sustainability impacts of SFSCs using integrated assessment methodologies, and extend the study to different regional contexts. Additionally, investigating policy interventions and governance mechanisms that can support the growth and resilience of SFSCs will be crucial for promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Originality/value: This review contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and systematic overview of SFSCs, addressing gaps left by previous review studies. The study's findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders seeking to enhance the adoption and support of SFSCs in contemporary food systems.","[Jia, Fu; Shahzadi, Gulnaz] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jia, Fu] Univ York, Sch Business & Soc, York YO10 5DD, England; [Bourlakis, Michael] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield, England; [John, Albert] Univ Hradec Kralove, Dept Management, Hradec Kralove 3, Czech Republic; [John, Albert] Univ Lahore, Lahore Business Sch, 1-Km Def Rd, Lahore, Pakistan",Capital University of Economics & Business; University of York - UK; Cranfield University; University of Hradec Kralove; University of Lahore,"Shahzadi, G (corresponding author), Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fu.jia@york.ac.uk; gullnaz140@gmail.com; m.bourlakis@cranfield.ac.uk; dralbertjohn@gmail.com,,,Beijing Social Science Fund Decision Consulting Major Project [23JCA011],Beijing Social Science Fund Decision Consulting Major Project,Research for this paper was supported by Beijing Social Science Fund Decision Consulting Major Project (23JCA011) .,,100,13,13,20,69,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 5,2024,435,,,,,,,,140364,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140364,,JAN 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper takes the first round of Central Environmental Protection Inspection as a natural experiment, reflecting the degree of green transformation through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) level of enterprises. Taking Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2022 as the research object, a dual machine learning model is used to determine whether this system can improve the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Using a dual machine learning model, it is found that the system can enhance the ESG level of enterprises and promote their green transformation. Mechanism analyses show that the system promotes green transformation by enhancing green innovation capability, safeguarding the rights and interests of upstream and downstream supply chain actors, and enhancing governance diligence, thus encouraging enterprises to assume environmental, social, and governance responsibilities. It is also found that at the macro-policy level, with the migration of the inspection area to the west and the strengthening of local environmental governance, and at the micro-firm level, the higher the degree of digitization and the larger the size of assets, the deeper the system effect on the green transformation of heavy-polluting enterprises.

Global food chains are often perceived to be less sustainable than local food chains. Yet, thorough food chain analyses and comparisons of different food chains across sustainability dimensions are rare. In this article we analyze the local Belgian and global Peruvian asparagus value chains and explore their sustainability performance. A range of indicators linked to environmental, economic and social impacts is calculated to analyze the contribution of the supply chains to economic development, resource use, labor relations, distribution of added value and governance issues. Our findings suggest that none of the two supply chains performs invariably better and that there are trade-offs among and between sustainability dimensions. Whereas the global chain uses water and other inputs more intensively and generates more employment per unit of land and higher yields, the local chain generates more revenue per unit of land.","[Schwarz, Jana; Schuster, Monica; Annaert, Bernd; Maertens, Miet; Mathijs, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Bioecon, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Schwarz, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Bioecon, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",jana.schwarz@kuleuven.be; monica.schuster@kuleuven.be; bernd.annaert@kuleuven.be; miet.maertens@kuleuven.be; erik.mathijs@kuleuven.be,,,European Union [311778]; FWO-Research Foundation Flanders; KU Leuven International Office,European Union(European Union (EU)); FWO-Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); KU Leuven International Office,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No. 311778.

Tied to the wide range of sustainability standards is the growth of partnerships between multinationals (MNCs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, these standards may unintentionally impose conditions that may exclude small-scale firms in developing countries from global supply chains, thus negatively affecting the poorest developing country producers, from what is known as the bottom of the pyramid.

However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors.

Keith; Kolcava, Dennis; Bernauer, Thomas",,,Stringent sustainability regulations for global supply chains are supported across middle-income democracies,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,,,,Article,,,,,,,TRADE,"Expanded international trade and globalised production networks are increasing the environmental and social impacts in middle-income countries (GNI per capita $1,136-$13,845). High-income countries (>$13,845) are seeking to mitigate the negative impacts of domestic consumption by imposing new sustainability regulations on global supply chains. Recent evidence suggests that these regulations are broadly supported across high-income countries. However, it remains unclear whether citizens of middle-income countries support aligning domestic sustainability regulations with the measures developed by high-income countries. Concerns about economic competitiveness and foreign imposition could increase public resistance toward such alignment. Alternatively, desires for continued market access in high-income countries and aspirations for strengthening local environmental and labour regulations could foster support for alignment. Based on survey-embedded experiments in the three largest democratic non-OECD economies (Brazil, India, Indonesia), we find surprisingly strong support for domestic-based measures that are aligned with emerging global supply chain sustainability regulations. Our findings suggest that support is largely driven by positive impact expectations, where the future benefits of alignment are perceived as outweighing concerns about increased costs. These results bode well for initiatives to install stricter sustainability regulations for global supply chains that are acceptable not only in high-income economies but also in non-OECD countries.","[Smith, E.

Organizations are compelled to integrate sustainable practices into their supply chains to navigate the complexities of the post-COVID-19 era and mitigate the far-reaching consequences of such disruptions. However, exploring supply chain imperatives from sustainability dimensions still remains underexplored, presenting a significant research gap, particularly in the fashion retail sector. In response, this study aims to pioneer an innovative approach by amalgamating Pareto analysis, Bayes theorem, and the Best-Worst Method to evaluate sustainability imperatives comprehensively. Focusing on emerging economies like Bangladesh and its fashion retail industry, this methodology synthesizes insights from literature reviews, expert feedback, and Pareto analysis to curate a definitive set of influential imperatives. Finally, the Bayesian Best-Worst Method is applied to examine them. The results reveal the availability of government support schemes to promote sustainability, developing strategic supply chain interventions to ameliorate the impact of disruptive events, and digitalizing the supply chain as the most monumental imperatives under economic, social, and environmental perspectives, respectively. The study's innovative methodology and its implications for sustainable supply chain management offer valuable insights for both academic research and practical application, presenting a strategic blueprint for the fashion retail industry to navigate and thrive in the post-COVID-19 era. This work can not only advance the theoretical understanding of supply chain sustainability but also provide actionable guidance for industry leaders in developing robust, resilient, and sustainable supply chain strategies.","[Imran, Md.

The research examines how the interplay of market drivers, public policies, and collective actions favoured farming, technological, and organisational innovations geared to support long-term economic growth and tackle, at the same time, environmental challenges. The tomato supply chain is characterised by a favourable convergence of attitudes, policies, and market conditions that over time allowed for fruitful interactions between private stakeholders and between the supply chain and public players. Decades of key stakeholders' interconnections within the tomato supply chain led to a success story of economic growth and attention to a new balance between agro-industry and environment, for the benefit of producers/processors, consumers, and natural resources. Profitability strategies inevitably imply intensification of farming in order to maximise profit levels per hectare, however, the tomato supply chain found a collective motivation that could grant profitability and concurrently reward producers and processors for attention paid to safeguarding the environment giving evidence that intensification does not necessarily conflict with requirements in support of sustainability.","[Mantino, Francesco; Forcina, Barbara] CREA Council Agr Res & Econ, Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, I-00198 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Mantino, F; Forcina, B (corresponding author), CREA Council Agr Res & Econ, Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",francesco.mantino@crea.gov.it; barbara.forcina@crea.gov.it,,,European Union [633814]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [633814] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This research is funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 633814 for the PEGASUS Project.

Network behavior is explored through policy document review and interviews. The findings revealed a small-world architecture, with system resiliency built-in by diversified marketing practices at central nodes. This robust network design helps to explain the long-term survival of local food systems despite the meteoric rise of global industrial food supply chains. Modern alternative food networks are an example of a movement that seeks to reorient economic power structures in response to a variety of food system-related issues not limited to consumer health but including environmental impacts. Uncovering the underlying network architecture of this sustainability-oriented social movement helps reveal how it weaves systemic change more broadly. The methods used in this study demonstrate how social values, social networks, markets, and governance systems embed to transform both physical landscapes and human bodies. Network actors crafted informal policy reports, which were directly incorporated in state and local official land-use and economic planning documents.

After an extensive literature review, four research questions were formulated and a questionnaire designed. From its distribution, 152 responses were collected from the textile industry. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to determine the most effective factors that could contribute to the evaluation of extensive aspects of sustainability in MtSCs as well as recognize the importance of constructs. The categorized constructs based on their importance included Environmental issues, Economic issues, Policy and governance, Participation, Social issues, Transparency and Leadership and support. A comprehensive rating for evaluating sustainability by indicating a readiness score and linguistic variables for each construct was developed in the form of a fuzzy expert system. The developed fuzzy expert system was applied in an Iranian textile company to assess its readiness status as a case application. The results indicated that the company had the highest and lowest readiness in Transparency and Environmental issues with total readiness scores of 2.65 and 0.17 respectively. The finding recommends that the company should pay more attention to environmental issues such as making a cutback on utility consumption and increasing recycled materials. The framework's validity was measured around 90% based on the satisfaction of experts' judgments, which enables the framework to be applied in different industrial settings. Theoretically, the findings contribute to the Resources-Based View (RBV) theory, with a focus on the sustainability of MtSCs, by unveiling a comprehensive set of factors for assessing sustainability and recognizing external and internal strategic resources that lead firms to sustainable competitive advantages.","[Shayganmehr, Masoud] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Kumar, Anil] London Metropolitan Univ, Guildhall Sch Business & Law, London, England; [Luthra, Sunil] Ch Ranbir Singh State Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Jhajjar, Haryana, India; [Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Kedleston Rd Campus, Derby DE22 1GB, England",Tarbiat Modares University; London Metropolitan University; University of Derby,"Garza-Reyes, JA (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Kedleston Rd Campus, Derby DE22 1GB, England.",shayganmehrmasoud@modares.ac.ir; A.Kumar@londonmet.ac.uk; sunilluthra1977@gmail.com; J.Reyes@derby.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,15,15,3,17,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,OCT 1,2021,317,,,,,,,,128302,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128302,,JUL 2021,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While reporting holds businesses accountable, it is not sufficient on its own without meaningful action. Business management plays a crucial role in implementing sustainability initiatives, and executives, as key decision-makers, must align organizational strategies and resources to achieve sustainability goals. A bibliometric analysis of sustainability-related literature across three business research domains-accounting, management, and governance-has been undertaken. Web of Science has been used as the data source to identify key themes, trends, and relationships. In the analysis, co-authorship, citation patterns, and keyword co-occurrence analysis have been implemented to uncover interconnections between the domains. The findings highlight both commonalities and unique aspects of each literature stream, offering insights into how business practices can more holistically address sustainability challenges.

The current research surrounding sustainability in the industry has witnessed a notable surge in efforts, primarily driven by a growing consciousness of environmental concerns. In this context, it is worth noting that the focus of assessment schemes in developed countries has predominantly gravitated toward economic and environmental factors, with relatively less emphasis placed on social performance (SP). Many researchers have underscored this disparity, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach encompassing all three sustainability dimensions. Hence, the present research examines the effects of green construction practices on economic performance (ECP) while considering the mediating role of environmental performance (EP) and SP. The results showed no direct impact of GCP on ECP. However, the mediating role of SP and EP in the association between GCP and ECP was found to be statistically significant. The present study provides several implications. This study presents empirical evidence that implementing GCP yields several benefits for contractors, including cost reduction in waste management, legal expenses, and energy consumption. These cost savings effectively offset the initial investment required to implement GCP, enabling construction projects to attain ECP thresholds. This study provides a significant contribution to the expanding corpus of knowledge concerning green building site practices and construction management. It offers novel insights into the influence of a project's EP and SP on its economic feasibility. Furthermore, this research study has effectively showcased the positive impact of GCP on construction projects' environmental construction performance, particularly concerning environmental and social considerations.

This results in an intensified pressure on the companies in the forest-based industry to improve their social and environmental management practices. To address this issue, country-specific governance frameworks are used; these frameworks involve a mix of mandatory or voluntary, public or private regulatory systems. A stringent legal system puts a strong emphasis on command and control instruments, a situation common to many of the post-socialist countries in Europe. As a response to insufficient governmental activities, private-market-based instruments, such as certification standards, are employed to demonstrate the sustainability of timber biomass-based supply chains. This trend is also visible in Romania, where despite the stringent legal framework, a large number of owners and companies have opted for voluntary certification. We evaluated how much of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC (R)) standard used for forest management certification is contingent on legal rules, and we concluded that 69% of the standard requirements are de jure addressed. We also evaluated, from a legal perspective, the non conformities identified between 2008 and 2017 in the 108 FSC audit reports. We document that de facto, the implementation of the legal system faces essential enforcement problems since 54% of the identified non-conformities represent a violation of laws. The three main non-compliances with the legal requirements are related to harvesting operations, a key activity to be addressed in supply chain management. Hence, the empirical evidences of this research highlight that the Romanian exhaustive legal frameworks with no flexibility in terms of compliance coupled with the governmental enforcement failures create a risky business environment for the companies operating in the forest industry.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) serves as a tool to measure maximum supplier efficiency based on any set of considered aspects. This study proposes a DEA model by integrating best possible criteria to the coherent framework for social sustainability based supplier selection. To this end, we analyse different Decision Making Units (DMUs) and compare the efficiency of each DMU with only the best one, so as to determine the most efficient one. This will eventually help in identifying the best supplier according to the aspects of social sustainability. A case evaluation of the proposed methodology has been conducted in the fast food supply chains and the best supplier was selected. Managers can use the proposed framework for supplier selection considering social sustainability for enhancing the overall sustainability capabilities of their supply chains. This research also points towards the importance of considering social sustainability and the related issues, right from the upstream of the supply chain. Considerations for the same can improve the capabilities of supply chain and can directly enhance the environmental, social, and governance performances of firms.","[Aashi, Sharma] ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management ABV, Management Div, Gwalior 474015, India; [Rajesh, R.] Indian Inst Management IIM Tiruchirappalli, Operat Management & Decis Sci, Tiruchirappalli 620024, India","ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology & Management, Gwalior","Rajesh, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management IIM Tiruchirappalli, Operat Management & Decis Sci, Tiruchirappalli 620024, India.",aashisharma.adm@gmail.com; rajeshambzha@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,4,4,20,63,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,2023 DEC 16,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10479-023-05767-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-023-05767-8,,DEC 2023,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Zero-deforestation policies by companies may be insufficient to achieve broader impact on their own due to leakage, lack of transparency and traceability, selective adoption and smallholder marginalization.

Ocean accounting is developing to meet this future challenge. Since the Law of the Sea Convention (1984), valuations of ocean economies have gradually adopted the System of National Accounts to measure productive activity, while recognising it's deficiencies in valuing environmental capital and flows. The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts has been accessed to capture the contributions of the environment via ecosystem goods and services. Recently ocean accounting has developed into an integrated monetary and physical environmental accounting framework for the oceans. Ocean accounts also have the potential to include contextual social and cultural information, though like the inclusion of environment, this may take time to achieve. However we observe that critical accounting, now accepted in mainstream accounting, has not previously been applied to this emerging field. Critical accounting asks fundamental questions of 'accounting for what?' and 'accounting for whom?' It is proposed that this alternative perspective can contribute to the development and emergence of a more accountable and inclusive ocean accounting framework contributing to areas that ocean governance has found problematic, such as sustainability, subsidies, transnational crime, including illegal fishing and slave labour in supply chains. A future for ocean accounting that is relevant to effective ocean governance, will need more than just numbers.","[Perkiss, Stephanie] Univ Wollongong, Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [McIlgorm, Alistair; Nichols, Rachel; Lewis, Anna R.; Lal, Kirti K.; Voyer, Michelle] Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur ANCOR, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Lal, Kirti K.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Voyer, Michelle] Nippon Fdn Ocean Nexus Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Lewis, Anna R.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong,"Perkiss, S (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",sperkiss@uow.edu.au; amcilgor@uow.edu.au; rnichols@uow.edu.au; lewisa@uow.edu.au; klal@uow.edu.au; mvoyer@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,86,9,9,2,18,,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,FEB,2022,136,,,,,,,,104901,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104901,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104901,,DEC 2021,,Environmental Studies; International Relations,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on an original dataset from a comparative survey of US and Dutch importers, this paper investigates factors that shape the construction of certification markets for citrus, focusing on the construction of markets for different kinds of certification schemes including Fair Trade, Organic, and GlobalGAP certification. The paper investigates from a comparative perspective whether the construction of markets differs across the US and Dutch political economies. The results show both the enduring effects of national political economies and the importance of global value chain dynamics.

GLOBALG.A.P. standards, in particular, have extended the traditional focus of retailer-led standards beyond food safety to include compliance points addressing environmental protection and labour welfare. This has stimulated considerable research on the implications of standards compliance for small producers. However, little attention has been paid either to the relationships between so-called private standards and state-based regulatory regimes or to the implications of standards compliance for corporate farms, their employees and neighbouring communities. This paper examines these relationships and implications in the context of plantation banana production in the Philippines, focussing, in particular, on gaps that emerge between the ideals of social and environmental responsibility embodied in private standards and actual practices of regulation. It finds that while compliance with private standards is associated with comparatively favourable treatment of labour, deference to poorly enforced national legislation conceals ongoing human rights and environmental concerns.

Secondly, a systematic evidence review synthesis methodology was used to synthesise the identified sustainability challenges from 18 qualitative studies focusing on the crop agri-food sector. A complex adaptive system, triple-bottom-line approach, and environmental, social, and governance sustainability models were applied to understand the nature of multi-tier supply chain structures and then identify sustainability challenges. Four major dimensions of sustainability challenges (social, economic, environmental and governance) for the lower-tier suppliers and buying firms were identified. Disintegration between buying firms and the lower-tier suppliers, predominantly due to their different locations, was found to be the primary reason for sustainability challenges in the crop agri-food sector.

Governance of such socio-economic-ecological networks plays a strong role in determining their resilience. Social processes of governance, such as collaboration between communities, can be systematically assessed through the existence and strength of connections between actors and their embeddedness in the broader socio-economic network by social network analysis (SNA). This paper examines how network governance of the tourism industry-dependent Swiss Gotthard region relates to resilience to climate change by SNA. The paper argues that economic diversification and a network structure supporting stability, flexibility, and innovation increase regional resilience to climate change. The Gotthard network has a high diversification capability due to high cohesion and close collaboration, limited innovative capacity by the existence of only two subgroups, and considerable flexibility through the centralized structure. Main weaknesses are a low density, uneven distribution of power, and a lack of integration of some supply chain sectors into the overall network.","[Luthe, Tobias; Wyss, Romano] Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland; [Schuckert, Markus] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci HTW Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure Res, Comercialstr 22, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland.",tobias.luthe@htwchur.ch,,,EU Interreg ClimAlpTour; Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS),EU Interreg ClimAlpTour(Interreg Europe); Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS),"We woud like to acknowledge the project funding by EU Interreg ClimAlpTour and by Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS), as well as to support by Ulrik Brandes and Bobo Nick, University of Konstanz.",,68,110,118,2,168,,,,1436-3798,1436-378X,,,,DEC,2012,12,4,,,,,839,854,,10.1007/s10113-012-0294-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-012-0294-5,,,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Where and how products are produced and consumed shape the environmental and social conditions of regions, far and wide. Distance, fluidity, and complexity in supply chains mask their uneven impacts. Researchers have prioritized the study of 'sectors' (e.g. automobile manufacturing, garment production) over specific corporations (e.g. Toyota, Nike), even though these corporations 'move and shape' the global economy. Research by NGOs reveals the importance of focusing on individual corporations to highlight unsustainable production practices and to foster transparency and accountability. This paper introduces a methodological framework, TRAcking Corporations Across Space and Time (TRACAST), to tell the 'story' behind a product by systematically linking companies across a supply chain and identifying environmental and social hotspots and key nodes of governance. TRACAST combines in-situ (e.g. interviews, surveys, fieldwork) and ex-situ (e.g. document analysis, mining of trade data) approaches. To illustrate its utility, we link Walmart, Lowe's, and The Home Depot in the United States to Russian logging companies via Chinese flooring manufacturers. TRACAST enables scholars studying the global flows of goods to engage deeply with questions related to specific corporations and how they affect people and the planet.","[Goldstein, Benjamin; Newell, Joshua P.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Goldstein, B (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",benjgo@umich.edu; jpnewell@umich.edu,,,Erb Institute at the University of Michigan,Erb Institute at the University of Michigan,The authors are grateful for the help of Greg Higgs in understanding the 'nuts and bolts' of bilateral trade data.

Using a timeline of events over more than a decade and other indicators of growth, we identified key points during its six developmental stages, and evidence of entrance into the final (Normative) phase. After distilling and evaluating the main criticisms and claims attributed to sustainable seafood initiatives globally, we concur that the movement has successfully cultivated a demand for solutions to the challenges of seafood sustainability by creating novel interactions along the value chain - even with the modest investment of our South African example. The global movement is best considered as a dynamic process with interplay at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and asynchronous phases of maturation. We recommend future investment in compliance, governance, credibility, and trust-building as key interventions to reduce risks of problem displacement, in support of a stable Normative phase across the seafood supply chain.

Local dynamics of norm contestation generate dilemmas for global regulators who aspire to be responsive to varied contexts in producing countries without watering down global regulatory agendas. Drawing on a range of empirical illustrations from Southeast Asia and Latin America, this paper develops a typology of domestication strategies currently being used by global private regulators and examines the effects of these strategies on supporting or undermining the overall values and purposes of global regulatory agendas. In the presence of pervasive local contestation surrounding global regulatory norms, norm domestication strategies are shown to offer important means of countering challenges to the power and legitimacy of global regulators. Nonetheless, the effects of such strategies remain highly contingent on path-dependent contests between competing regulatory coalitions at both local and global levels.","[Macdonald, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Macdonald, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",kmac@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,80,4,4,1,6,,,,1756-932X,1756-9338,,,,SEP,2020,30,5,,,SI,,276,290,,10.1002/eet.1908,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eet.1908,,SEP 2020,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, sustainable management of TSW is challenging as it contains hazardous chemicals. Implementing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices can support managing TSW towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is not easy to implement ESG practices for TSW management since numerous challenges exist in the system. To assist TSW management through ESG implementation, it is imperative to investigate the interactions among challenges and mitigation strategies. However, the existing decision-making models cannot deal with the uncertainty and vagueness on a border scale during interaction evaluation and alternatives ranking. Additionally, there is a shortage of scientific works on ESG practices in emerging economies. Therefore, this study, for the first time, offers an integrated novel Dombi t-norm and Dombi t-conorm grounded interval valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) Delphi, an extended IVFFSs-weighted influence non-liner Gause system (WINGS), and novel IVFFSs-TODIM approach which is utterly lacking in the present literature. Also, the study offers a strategic roadmap to understand the interlinkage of findings with SDGs. The results of the IVFFSs-WINGS analysis confirmed that the Lack of solid waste management policy is the most critical challenge for ESG implementation. Further, IVFFSs-TODIM analysis confirmed that the Policy development for TSW management complying with ESG and SDGs is the top ESG challenges mitigation strategy for TSW management. The study's findings will provide guidance for government agencies, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders of the emerging economies tannery industry for successful implementation of ESG practices, thus helping to achieve SDGs.","[Moktadir, Md.

However, scientific evidence on the socio-economic and environmental effects of governing value chains and origin landscapes through this voluntary, market-based arrangement is scarce. Honey appears ideal for GI labeling: having unique, physically identifiable and geographically localizable properties dependent upon the local ecosystem and beekeeping practices. White honey from the Kilum-Ijim forest in the Cameroon Highlands was GI registered in 2013 aiming to guarantee product quality, increase beekeeper selling prices and protect the forest. Long-term panel data from stakeholder interviews, market surveys and participatory action research show the extent to which the GI actually benefited beekeepers, and how the honey value chain and landscape developed since registration. Although honey production and productivity remained steady, profits augmented as prices increased and sales became more nationwide, improving beekeeper's living standards, and appear attributable to the GI. Deforestation continued and imposter brands abounded, signaling potential supply shortages, increased input costs and competition which could affect future profits and the GI reputation and changing the distribution of benefits to suppliers rather than beekeepers. These findings suggest that whilst the Oku white honey GI contributed to short-term positive livelihood effects, longer-term positive impacts which support conservation of the landscape have been ineffective, and the durability of the positive economic impacts is questionable. Although multiple arrangements govern the value chain and landscape, even together with the GI these are insufficient to balance the many demands on this productive landscape, suggesting the limits of weak institutions and non-state governance to protect vulnerable landscapes and ecosystems, and producer's livelihoods. This reality check of the benefits from the Oku white honey GI highlights the importance of coherent, effective governance of the nexus of both landscapes and markets for products from these landscapes.","[Ingram, Verina] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hansen, Maria Ellemann; Bosselmann, Aske Skovmand] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",Wageningen University & Research; University of Copenhagen,"Ingram, V (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",verina.ingram@wur.nl,,,,,,,102,9,10,2,28,,,,,2624-893X,,,,SEP 10,2020,3,,,,,,,,102,10.3389/ffgc.2020.00102,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00102,,,,Ecology; Forestry,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among these, transnational efforts-such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and corporate commitments to zero deforestation have been highly influential but often tend to overvalue environmental over socio-economic outcomes. This article discusses to what extent domestic governance models of palm oil producing countries can be better equipped to reconcile domestic demands such as economic development and poverty alleviation, and transnational concerns about forest conservation. We do so by looking into the Brazilian case, where the government intended to drive oil palm expansion in the Amazon through a program launched in 2010 that simultaneously only allowed expansion into already deforested areas and offered companies incentives to engage smallholder farmers in their supply chains. Our findings, drawn from primary research activities and existing literature, indicate that Brazil has managed to avoid deforestation typically associated with oil palm expansion elsewhere. Oil palm establishment involved the conversion of 0.8% and 1.3% of primary forests for corporate and smallholder plantations, respectively. However, the Brazilian government did not manage to optimally enhance smallholder participation in the sector, as significant differences in performance were observed between farmers, ranging from very successful (17%) to highly unsuccessful (12%); and failed to achieve sectoral development and competitiveness targets. While some failings can be attributed to external factors such as context, broader domestic governance frameworks and alignments, and private supply chain initiatives, the program itself did not manage to reconcile social, environmental and economic objectives into a single coherent sectoral governance model. Yet, this case study suggests that domestic governance strategies can enable commodity production in a way that is more coherent with national priorities, at the same time as preventing deforestation and minimizing social risks more effectively.

However, the ways that local elite narratives and power networks influence the design and implementation of policies is poorly understood. We examine the role that local agribusiness narratives have on producers' resistance to supply chain policies through the concept of the sacrifice frontier. We theorize sacrifice frontiers are regions where reinforcing perceptions that conversion of native vegetation has high economic potential and low conservation importance combine with rapid processes of wealth and power consolidation by agribusiness interests. We posit that these dimensions of a sacrifice frontier make rapid land use change and ongoing social and ecological harm especially probable as they reinforce constraints on sustainability governance. Here, we build on existing theories of environmental sacrifice through the case of the Cerrado biome, Brazil's most active deforestation frontier. We argue that in the Cerrado, and other sacrifice frontiers like it, interventions that seek to reduce native vegetation loss cannot rely on supply-chain led policies, but instead need to foster more territorial multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder discussions to alter the narrative of sociocultural and biodiversity sacrifice locally. We suggest this can be achieved by paying attention to local needs in a manner that is inclusive to all land users present within a targeted landscape.","[Levy, Samuel A.; Garrett, Rachael D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci & Humanities Social &Polit, Zurich, Switzerland; [Levy, Samuel A.] New York Univ, Dept Environm Studies, New York, NY USA; [Garik, Anna Victoria Nogueira] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA USA; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; New York University; Boston University; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Levy, SA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci & Humanities Social &Polit, Zurich, Switzerland.",sam.levy@nyu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1739253]; European Research Council [949932]; BU Global Development Policy Center; ETH Zurich; European Research Council (ERC) [949932] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); BU Global Development Policy Center; ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number 1739253] , European Research Council [grant number 949932] , the BU Global Development Policy Center, and startup funding from ETH Zurich.",,170,4,4,9,13,,,,0016-7185,1872-9398,,,,MAR,2024,150,,,,,,,,103972,10.1016/j.geoforum.2024.103972,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2024.103972,,FEB 2024,,Geography,,Geography,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Central to these challenges is the issue of climate change, which threatens social, environmental, and economic stability, potentially leading to an unprecedented global catastrophe if left unchecked. In developing economies, these problems are further exacerbated by poverty, poor-quality institutions, and unemployment rates. Recent global efforts to combat climate change and other environmental damages include the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite their strengths, one of the major weaknesses of the SDGs is the conflictual nature of SDG 1 (No Poverty) and the environmental SDGs (SDG 12, 14, 15 and 17). This paper aims to demonstrate that for small-scale miners in sub-Saharan Africa, these conflicting SDGs coupled with fragile socio-political environments, exacerbate the issue. Using a qualitative lens and Zambia and Ghana as case studies, the paper first argues that the 'informal spaces,' in which these artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) operators function are a result of their socio-political context. Within such contexts, survival transcends all else and the environment unwittingly suffers due to poor policies and inadequate health and safety education. Secondly, drawing on multistakeholder platform collaborative governance theory, the paper underscores the need for formalisation and argues that a collaborative governance approach, modelled on existing Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) schemes, is crucial for achieving the goals of reconciling conflicts between the environmental, social and economic SDGs.","[Hilson, Abigail Efua] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, England",University of Kent,"Hilson, AE (corresponding author), Kent Business Sch, Parkwood Rd, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, England.",a.hilson@kent.ac.uk,,,British Academy Small Grant [SG171460]; British Academy [SG171460] Funding Source: British Academy,British Academy Small Grant(British Academy); British Academy(British Academy),This study was supported by the British Academy Small Grant [no.

This contribution includes a thorough analysis of several institutional frameworks and guiding principles that have been purposely developed to foster corporate citizenship behaviours. Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology involved a broad analysis of US regulatory policies, voluntary instruments and soft laws that have stimulated organisations to implement and report their responsible behaviours. Findings - This contribution ties the corporate citizenship behaviours with the institutional and stakeholder theories. The case study evaluated the US's federal government, bureaus and its agencies' policies on human rights, health and social welfare, responsible supply chain and procurement of resources, anticorruption, bribery and fraudulent behaviours, energy and water conservation practices as well as environmental protection, among other issues. Research limitations/implications - Past research may have not sufficiently linked corporate citizenship with the corporate social responsibility (CSR) paradigm. This research reports how different US regulatory institutions and non-governmental organisations are pushing forward the social responsibility, environmental sustainability as well as the responsible corporate governance agenda. Originality/value - This research critically analyses US policy and regulatory instruments including relevant legislation and executive orders that are primarily intended to unlock corporate citizenship practices from business and industry. It has also provided a conceptual framework for the corporate citizenship notion.

Yet, little research demonstrates how food policies are integrated with food systems and across governance to achieve urban sustainability. This paper presents the Trans-Governance and Food Systems (Tr-GaF) framework for food policy integration developed to evaluate the Australian food policy landscape. The analysis of 102 food-relevant policy documents sourced from multiple government institutions in Queensland, Western Australia, and Victoria identifies limited food policy integration in Australia, with little attention paid to foodrelated urban planning. Policy misalignments arise in the agrifood economy, health and well-being, and environment and ecology domains, with horizontal and vertical fragmentation across governance levels and sectors. Inadequate integration with food systems further jeopardises the efficiency of urban food supply chains and consumption activities. These three prominent issues collectively stifle urban sustainability by economically restraining food supply chain actors' ability to innovate and compete. While environmental imbalance worsens, urbanites inevitably face barriers to maintaining health and social well-being. Tr-GaF provides an evidencedbased framework for policymakers to evaluate and integrate food policies anchored in food systems governed by collaborative multi-scalar government agencies, institutions, food industries, and civil society. In doing so, urban development can sustainably evolve economically, socially, and environmentally.","[Summerhayes, Lijun] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Fac Engn, Sch Architecture & Built Environm ABE, Gardens Point Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Baker, Douglas] QUT, Fac Engn, Sch ABE, Gardens Point Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Summerhayes, L (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Fac Engn, Sch Architecture & Built Environm ABE, Gardens Point Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",l.summerhayes@qut.edu.au; d2.baker@qut.edu.au,,,"Future Food Systems Cooperative Research Centre (FFS CRC) , established under the Australian Government's CRC Program","Future Food Systems Cooperative Research Centre (FFS CRC) , established under the Australian Government's CRC Program","We acknowledge the financial and other support of the Future Food Systems Cooperative Research Centre (FFS CRC) , established under the Australian Government's CRC Program.

For this reason, the implementation of SSCM often does not result in noticeable benefits. So far, research has failed to offer any explanations for this discrepancy. In view of this fact, our study aims at identifying and analyzing the factors that underlie successful SSCM. Success factors are identified by means of a systematic literature review and are then integrated into an explanatory model. Consequently, the proposed success factor model is tested on the basis of an empirical study focusing on recycling networks of the electrics and electronics industry. We found that signaling, information provision and the adoption of standards are crucial preconditions for strategy commitment, mutual learning, the establishment of ecological cycles and hence for the overall success of SSCM.

The Northern model of city-region food localization has recently been taken up by governments, and promoted by international agencies such as the FAO and embedded in the New Urban Agenda (NUA) of Habitat III and the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. This paper focuses on an alternative conceptualization and practice of food system governance developed in Chinese cities since the late 1980s. This case study of Nanjing focuses on the similarities and differences between the Chinese model of comprehensive food system planning and localization and the Northern model of localization now being exported to the Global South. The Nanjing case offers an alternative model of food system governance could be more appropriate for other countries undergoing rapid urbanization and dealing with growing urban food insecurity.","[Zhong, Taiyang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Crush, Jonathan; Si, Zhenzhong] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Crush, Jonathan] Univ Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa; [Scott, Steffanie] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Nanjing University; University of Waterloo; University of the Western Cape; University of Waterloo,"Crush, J (corresponding author), Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",taiyangzhong@163.com; jcrush@wlu.ca; zsi@wlu.ca; sdscott@uwaterloo.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; International Development Research Centre; Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences","We acknowledge the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the International Development Research Centre as well as the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn) for providing the data used for Fig. 1.",,69,11,11,20,76,,,,2211-9124,,,,,SEP,2023,38,,,,,,,,100709,10.1016/j.gfs.2023.100709,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2023.100709,,JUL 2023,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The creation of voluntary certification programs is an effort aimed at finding new ways to influence corporate conduct along supply chains. This article contributes novelty and insight on cotton certification in SSA by exploring the most relevant programs in detail with regard to the demands of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We selected the five most central NGOs dedicated to environmental sustainability in agriculture: Friends of the Earth (FoE), Greenpeace, Oxfam, Pesticide Action Network (PAN), and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). After identifying these NGOs' demands regarding pesticides, fertilizers and genetically modified (GM) cotton, we analyzed the requirements of the four most dominant programs certifying SSA cotton cultivation: the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), Cotton made in Africa (CmiA), the EU Organic Regulation and Fairtrade Labelling Organization (FLO). The results of our document analysis are bolstered by semi-structured interviews with stakeholders on NGOs' stances and roles in standard setting and implementation. We find that the EU Organic Regulation scores best in terms of environmental sustainability. Those programs in which NGOs actively participate are less ambitious compared to the public standard. Therefore, we conclude that, if NGOs maintain their commitment to multi-stakeholder initiatives, they risk contributing to `greenwashing' corporate conduct by mobilizing consumer support for labelling programs that actually fall behind existing public regulation on organic certification.","[Partzsch, Lena; Zander, Macy; Robinson, Hannah] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Partzsch, L (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",lena.partzsch@ifp.uni-freiburg.de; macyzander@gmail.com; herobinson91@gmail.com,,,German Federal Ministry of Research and Education [031B0235A],German Federal Ministry of Research and Education,This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education (project no. 031B0235A).

Like other standard-setters, the MSC's 'theory of change' presumes that markets use this information to select for sustainable products, providing an incentive for producers to improve their practices and become certified. However, the underlying mechanisms which actually work to link market behavior and participation in the program in different contexts have not been systematically identified. We draw on broad MSC field experience to identify processes that have supported the theory of change in individual fisheries. Then, we develop a broadly applicable rapid assessment protocol, relying on a semi-structured interviews of key informants, to gather systematic evidence for key dynamics within the theory of change: the effects of going through MSC certification on market processes, partnerships in the fishery, and governance. In a pilot test of the protocol, we identify important common and idiosyncratic processes in three canned product fisheries: United States west coast albacore tuna, Brittany sardines, and Portuguese sardines. We find that the harvesters and buyers/processors in these fisheries sought certification primarily to expand or maintain their market share, and that certification was synergistic with stakeholder cooperation. The cases demonstrate how our rapid assessment interviews allow program participants to relate their experience in their own words yet facilitate systematic comparison to identify common mechanisms within the theory of change. We propose its wider application to systematically advance our understanding of social and economic processes that drive of eco-label interventions in different geographies and supply chains around the world.","[Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Ctr Sustaining Seafood, Sch Aqut & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Himes-Cornell, Amber] Food & Agr Org United Nat, Fisheries & Aquaculture Dept, Rome, Italy; [Pita, Cristina] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dept Environm & Planning, Aveiro, Portugal; [Arton, Ashleigh; Favret, Margaux; Averill, Dan; Longo, Catherine Sarah] Sci & Stand Marine Stewardship Council, London, England; [Stohs, Stephen] Southwest Fishery Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, La Jolla, CA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Universidade de Aveiro; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Longo, CS (corresponding author), Sci & Stand Marine Stewardship Council, London, England.",katie.longo@msc.org,,,Walton Family Foundation; Marine Stewardship Council; [2020.02510]; [UIDP/50017/2020 + UIDB50017/2020],Walton Family Foundation; Marine Stewardship Council; ;,This research was conducted with support from the Marine Stewardship Council and the Walton Family Foundation.,,31,8,9,0,16,,,,,2296-7745,,,,DEC 13,2021,8,,,,,,,,791085,10.3389/fmars.2021.791085,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.791085,,,,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the editorial we outline a new umbrella term, Values-based Territorial Food Networks (VTFNs), which synthesises the key commonalities that characterise alternatives to the mainstream food system. VTFNs are defined as networks that connect agro-food and related stakeholders within a defined territory that operate according to a coherent set of ethical values centred on social justice and wellbeing, environmental integrity, participatory governance and economic fairness. We discuss how VTFNs relate to earlier concepts, showing the evolution from 'alternative' to 'values based', from 'local' to 'territorial' and from 'supply chains' to 'networks'. The editorial also gives an overview of the empirical case studies in the special issue, which explore 10 place-based food initiatives (from Austria, France, Greece, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Hungary, Australia, Brazil and Japan) and address benefits, challenges, social learning and controversies associated with VTFNs. The cases are grouped into three thematic areas. 'Social learning and resilience' focuses on collaboration through diverse partnerships as a necessary condition for social innovation and for understanding new socio-technical practices. 'Agency, negotiations and food governance' explores the socioeconomic struggles, interrelations and negotiated values associated with VTFNs. 'Sociocultural environments, social capital and reflexive localism' discusses the interplay between the economic and sociocultural dimensions related to VTFNs. The transversality of VTFN allows us to think about these dimensions from a systemic perspective, thus advancing debates on the diverse sites and modes of agro-food sustainability.","[Nemes, Gusztav] Ctr Econ & Reg Stud KRTK ELKH, Inst Econ, Toth Kalman U 4, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary; [Reckinger, Rachel] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Humanities Educ & Social Sci, Dept Humanities, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Lajos, Veronika] Univ Miskolc, Dept Cultural & Visual Anthropol, Miskolc, Hungary; [Zollet, Simona] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Acad Govt Ind Collaborat, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan",University of Luxembourg; University of Miskolc; Hiroshima University,"Nemes, G (corresponding author), Ctr Econ & Reg Stud KRTK ELKH, Inst Econ, Toth Kalman U 4, H-1097 Budapest, Hungary.",nemes.gusztav@krtk.hu,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21K20068] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,81,9,9,5,27,,,,0038-0199,1467-9523,,,,JAN,2023,63,1,,,SI,,3,19,,10.1111/soru.12419,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soru.12419,,,,Geography; Sociology,,Geography; Sociology,,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional evolutionary game models cannot describe this effect. In this study, Gaussian white noise is introduced into the stochastic evolutionary game model of PPP supply chain knowledge sharing. The numerical simulation of the model is carried out to analyze the influence of parameter changes on the strategy selection of enterprise groups. The result shows that the strong knowledge power enterprise group is more sensitive with the variation of parameters than that of the weak knowledge power enterprise group. However, the weak enterprise group has a more vital willingness to share knowledge. Incentive measures can increase the knowledge-sharing benefits and promote the strong knowledge powerful enterprise group toward the sharing strategy. Increasing the mutual trust coefficient, reducing the sharing cost, and improving the enterprise's transformation ability will help both sides to evolve into the sharing strategy more quickly.

We discuss a new direction for developing corporate environmental performance (CEP) ratings and propose a solution to the limited validity problem by anchoring such ratings in environmental controversies. The study uses a novel machine learning approach to make the ratings more comprehensive and transparent, based on a set of algorithmic approaches that handle nonlinearity when aggregating ESG indicators. This approach minimizes the rater subjectivity and preferences inherent in traditional ESG indicators. The findings indicate that controversies as proxies for non-compliance with environmental responsibilities can be predicted well.

In particular the transport industry is still considered as a large polluter. Therefore, stakeholders put pressure on the industry to work on their environmental footprint. Shippers assess whether their supply chain as a whole can be increasingly 'greened', given increasing environmental awareness from both customers (in B2B settings) and consumers (in B2C settings). Ports, as important nodes in transport networks, seek to respond to these pressures. However, their variety of geographical location, economic situation, governance structures and administrative heritage would suggest different preferences towards environmental initiatives. This paper discusses the results of a multiple case study analysis, based on desk research and in-depth interviews with seven port authorities within the Hamburg-Le Havre range. The main goal was to investigate how port authorities respond towards the challenge of greening the shipping industry, in particular on the motives and rationale behind the set-up of pricing schemes, and what kind of institutional arrangements are installed. From an institutional theory perspective, a high degree of isomorphism is observed in the Hamburg-Le Havre range as these ports are focusing mainly on Environmental Shipping Index (ESI) based bonus schemes for environmental differentiated port infrastructure pricing. Managerial and policy implications/recommendations, based on the empirical results of the cross-case study, are formulated in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of environmental differentiated charging schemes.","[Geerts, Magali; Langenus, Mychal; Dooms, Michael] VUB, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Geerts, M (corresponding author), VUB, Brussels, Belgium.",Magali.Geerts@vub.be,,,,,,,61,4,4,0,23,,,,0391-8440,,,,,DEC,2017,44,4,,,SI,,517,544,,10.19272/201706704002,http://dx.doi.org/10.19272/201706704002,,,,Economics; Transportation,,Business & Economics; Transportation,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach The authors adopt a theory-building approach using a multiple case study design, including four SMEs operating in SCs from two developing economies (i.e. Republic of North Macedonia and People's Republic of China), in which the authors conduct both within-case and cross-case analyses. Findings Social bonds (known as vrski in Macedonian and guanxi in Chinese) were found to govern buyer-supplier exchanges by supporting the establishment of personal trust and the reduction of distrust. These social bonds compensate for the institutional deficiencies in developing economies and thus encourage ICT-enabled information sharing by SMEs in their SCs. Research limitations/implications - By applying the theoretical perspectives of TCE and SET to the cross-case analysis, the authors develop nine propositions to explain ICT-enabled information sharing and its interdependencies with external environment, governance structures and interpersonal relationships in developing economies. Further research is recommended to refine and test the generalizability of the theoretical model. Practical implications - Firms have to develop and nurture social bonds with their suppliers from developing economies to reduce risks related to the environmental uncertainty and institutional voids. This can increase trust and decrease distrust associated with ICT-enabled information sharing. Originality/value The study examines why and how external environment (environmental uncertainty and institutional environment), social bonds (vrski and guanxi) and interpersonal mechanisms (trust and distrust) influence ICT-enabled information sharing of SMEs operating in developing economies.","[Mirkovski, Kristijan] Deakin Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Business Analyt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Davison, Robert M.] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Syst, Coll Business, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Martinsons, Maris G.] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Dept Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Deakin University; City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong,"Mirkovski, K (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Business Analyt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",k.mirkovski@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,63,25,25,5,58,,,,0957-4093,1758-6550,,,,AUG 12,2019,30,3,,,,,892,926,,10.1108/IJLM-06-2017-0155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-06-2017-0155,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of meso-institutions also offers theoretical support when evaluating a wide variety of voluntary standards that have been introduced within value chains in recent decades. Such tools can be considered meso-institutions because of their features, and because of their role in translating general normative rules into specific mechanisms that delineate the domain of activities of supply chain agents. While various aspects of meso-institutions have been investigated, little is known about their relationship with micro-level structures and the determinants of firm's voluntary participation. The present paper investigates the association between a private standard, different forms of transaction governance in the supply chain, and the role that internal and external risks play in voluntary participation in the standard. The analysis draws upon secondary data taken from a representative sample of firms that form part of the European soybean supply chain. Our findings show that firms that participate in this standard have fewer hybrid forms and higher levels of spot markets. This suggests that some of the functions of hybrid forms are fulfilled by the meso-institution. The results also show that risks associated with firm's behavioral uncertainty are more conducive to the participation in the standard than environmental-related risks.","[Soregaroli, Claudio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Agr & Food Econ, Piacenza, Italy; [Varacca, Alessandro; Platoni, Silvia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piacenza, Italy; [Ricci, Elena Claire] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy; [Tillie, Pascal] European Commiss, Directorate Sustainable Resources, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain; [Stranieri, Stefanella] Univ Milan, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Verona; University of Milan,"Varacca, A (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piacenza, Italy.",alessandro.varacca@unicatt.it,,,,,,,57,3,3,3,19,,,,2040-5790,2040-5804,,,,DEC,2022,44,4,,,,,1660,1681,,10.1002/aepp.13252,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aepp.13252,,MAR 2022,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,,Agriculture; Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

They exert strong lock-in effects that hinder transitions towards more sustainable agri-food systems. Indeed, their marketing practices generally result in excluding the most sustainable food products, such as local, low-input, small-scale farmers' products. Recently in Belgium, several initiatives have been created to enable the introduction of local products on supermarket shelves. In this article, we study three of those initiatives to analyse if the development of local sourcing in supermarkets opens up an opportunity for a transition towards more sustainable agri-food systems. We conceptualise transitions as a shift in governance and ethical values and adopt a pragmatist approach of ethics combined with the systemic perspective of transition studies, to evaluate the impact of these initiatives. Our analysis shows that they mainly contribute to the reproduction of the incumbent agri-food system. It also highlights that first, to be a driver for sustainability transitions, food ethics need to be systemic i.e. relate to a systemic understanding of problems and perspective of sustainability, including social justice. And second, it highlights that governance arrangements involving not only representative organisations of the various agri-food and non-agricultural actors, but also actors upholding ethical values that are currently missing in conventional supply chains and representing excluded and marginalised interests, favour the uptake of such systemic ethics by incumbent actors. Hence, systemic ethics and inclusive governance are key features for initiatives to contribute to a sustainability transition.","[Bui, Sibylle; Costa, Ionara; De Schutter, Olivier; Dedeurwaerdere, Tom] Univ Louvain, Ctr Philosophy Law, Pl Montesquieu 2, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Hudon, Marek] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Ave FD Roosevelt 42, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Feyereisen, Marlene] Univ Liege, SEED, Dept Sci & Gest Environm, Ave Longwy 185, B-6700 Arlon, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; University of Liege,"Bui, S (corresponding author), Univ Louvain, Ctr Philosophy Law, Pl Montesquieu 2, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",sibylle.bui@uclouvain.be; ionara.dacosta@uclouvain.be; olivier.deschutter@uclouvain.be; tom.dedeurwaerdere@uclouvain.be; mhudon@ulb.ac.be; marlene.feyereisen@ulg.ac.be,,,"Belgian Science Policy Office, under the project FOOD4SUSTAINABILITY [BR/121/A5]; European Commission, under the project GENCOMMONS (ERC Grant) [284]","Belgian Science Policy Office, under the project FOOD4SUSTAINABILITY; European Commission, under the project GENCOMMONS (ERC Grant)","We acknowledge co-funding of this research from the Belgian Science Policy Office, under the project FOOD4SUSTAINABILITY (contract BR/121/A5) and from the European Commission, under the project GENCOMMONS (ERC Grant Agreement 284).We also wish to thank the editors of this special issue for giving very useful comments on an earlier version of this paper.",,51,49,54,10,67,,,,0889-048X,1572-8366,,,,JUN,2019,36,2,,,,,277,288,,10.1007/s10460-019-09917-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-019-09917-2,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; History & Philosophy Of Science; Sociology",,Agriculture; History & Philosophy of Science; Sociology,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper explores the relationship between business models, value chains and business ecosystems, and demonstrates a meta-model for transport-related services that involve profound incorporation of new technologies. The meta-model consists of four elements: end customer value (value proposition to the end user), business value (shareholder value), collaborative value (business value to the supply chain) and societal value (value creation in the supply chain and control of negative externalities).

The study focuses on critical indicators such as the green patent application to measure green innovation outcomes. Leveraging a panel dataset of paired Chinese listed firms from 2009 to 2022, we examine the impact of customers' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on suppliers' green innovation activities. Our model is integrated with fixed effects for both industry and year. Our analysis reveals that customers with firm ESG commitments significantly enhance their suppliers' green innovation outcomes, particularly when they possess greater bargaining power and advanced green innovation capabilities. Additionally, we identify pressure and collaboration as critical mechanisms through which these effects are realized. These findings extend the discourse on sustainable supply chain management by highlighting the crucial role of customer-driven ESG initiatives in fostering upstream innovation, offering valuable insights for scholars and practitioners.","[Sun, Weizheng; Kou, Meixin] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizheng] Capital Univ Econ & Business, China ESG Inst, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoyue] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Stat, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Cui, Yin] Tianjin Acad Social Sci, Inst Urban Econ, Tianjin 300191, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuning] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; Capital University of Economics & Business; Capital University of Economics & Business; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Sun, WZ (corresponding author), Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.;Sun, WZ (corresponding author), Capital Univ Econ & Business, China ESG Inst, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",sunweizheng@cueb.edu.cn; 22022020028@cueb.edu.cn; zhangxiaoyue@cueb.edu.cn; cuiyin86@126.com; shuning.chen@zuel.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Young Academic Innovative Team of the Capital University of Economics and Business [QNTD202203]; [72102154],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Academic Innovative Team of the Capital University of Economics and Business;,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 72102154, and the Young Academic Innovative Team of the Capital University of Economics and Business, grant number QNTD202203.",,82,2,2,53,58,,,,,2071-1050,,,,SEP,2024,16,17,,,,,,,7770,10.3390/su16177770,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16177770,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review provides a broad theoretical exploration of the main features of urban sprawl but also of sustainable urban policies in Western Europe and North America. Urban sprawl can be observed in both continents, as the search for higher standards of economic, social, and environmental sustainability is also an essential feature of urban governance in the last years. Urban sprawl has been slightly weaker in Western Europe, as its are cities generally more compact. Moreover, in Western Europe, urban sprawl has sometimes been confronted with ex-ante preventive policies. However, in North America, urban sprawl from the 1950s has been an essential element of the social ordering and, thus, of the American way of life. In both cases, urban sprawl has generated successive rounds of accumulation of built capital, which is currently managed in sustainable ways essentially through ex-post and palliative measures, that is, trying to sustain what is unsustainable. In other words, the idea is to make urban sprawl more sustainable but without altering its main morphological elements.","[Bueno-Suarez, Carlos; Coq-Huelva, Daniel] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 2, Avda Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain; [Coq-Huelva, Daniel] Univ Seville, Inst Estudios Amer Latina, Ave Ciudad Jardin 20-22, Seville 41005, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Bueno-Suárez, C (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 2, Avda Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",cbsuarez@us.es; dcoq@us.es,,,,,,,261,39,41,8,96,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUN,2020,12,11,,,,,,,4445,10.3390/su12114445,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12114445,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then use case studies of three electronic product manufacturers to illustrate the framework, yielding empirically testable propositions regarding when multi -sourcing may enable cost management controls, performance management controls, and both types of control. The evidence demonstrates the importance of simultaneously considering mul-tiple interorganizational design choices when studying management controls in supply chains.

Examining value chains through a gender lens can help design and implement interventions that enhance opportunities for women in the fisheries and address gender inequalities in the sector. We conducted a VCA in 2015 of the wild-caught mud crab (Scylla serrata) fishery in Bua Province, Fiji. We found five main players involved in the selling of mud crabs - fishers, traders, retail shops, restaurants and exporters. The value chain was dominated by Indigenous (iTaukei) women fishers (88.1% of fishers) and characterised by low technological input, targeted largely for domestic markets or consumption, and with limited value-adding activities. Although most women harvested mud crabs on a part-time basis, it was an important source of income for most with 30% relying on it as their main livelihood. Despite being a lucrative commodity, there are several bottlenecks in the fishery - the relative informality of relationships amongst players in the value chain, the independent livelihood-driven harvest behaviours of fishers, and opportunistic sale of products. As a result, the fishery did not meet the demands of the domestic market. Our study concluded the gendered-skewness in the fishery increases the vulnerability of the chain to declines in economic productivity because of its reliance on irregular suppliers, and gender-based constraints. However, the low frequency and intensity of harvesting and use of low technological harvesting methods meant the fishery was not over-exploited and likely sustainable.","[Mangubhai, Sangeeta] Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Soc & Environm Res Ctr, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Mangubhai, Sangeeta; Fox, Margaret; Nand, Yashika] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Fiji Country Program, Suva, Fiji; [Fox, Margaret] Pacific Community, Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Nand, Yashika] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Mason, Natalie] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Australian Institute of Marine Science; University of Melbourne,"Mangubhai, S (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Climate Soc & Environm Res Ctr, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",smangubhai@gmail.com,,,"David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Ministry of Fisheries - Flora Family Foundation [2015-2694]; University of Technology Sydney, as part of the Wiley - University of Technology Sydney agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians; [2015-41007]","David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Ministry of Fisheries - Flora Family Foundation; University of Technology Sydney, as part of the Wiley - University of Technology Sydney agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians;","We thank all the communities, traders, exporters, market sellers, shop retailers, restaurant employees and consumers for participating in this study.

As most of the environmental and social burden is caused in lower tiers, the authors use the iceberg analogy. Design/methodology/approach Findings from 12 case studies and 53 interviews, publicly available and internal firm data are presented. In an abductive research approach, transaction cost economics (TCE) conceptually guides the analytical iteration processes between theory and data. Findings This study provides eight LTSM approaches grouped into three categories: direct (holistic, product-, region-, and event-specific) indirect (multiplier-, alliance- and compliance-based) and neglect (tier-1-based). Focal firms choose between these approaches depending on the strength of observed contextual factors (stakeholder salience, structural supply network complexity, product and industry salience, past supply network incidents, socio-economic and cultural distance and lower tier supplier dependency), leading to perceived sustainability risk (PSR). Research limitations/implications By depicting TCE's theoretical boundaries in predicting LTSM governance modes, the theory is elevated to the supply network level of analysis. Future research should investigate LTSM at the purchasing category level of analysis to compare and contrast PSR profiles for different purchase tasks and to validate and extend the framework. Practical implications This study serves as a blueprint for the development of firms' LTSM capabilities that suit their unique PSR profiles.

This however has been accompanied by unexpected burden shifting of resource extractions and environmental emissions to less developed countries. Given that little attention has been paid to the trade-embodied resources and emissions throughout the BRI, this paper, for the first time, accounts for the water, land, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus footprints of 65 BRI nations and traces the flows embodied in international trade between the BRI and remaining 124 economies by employing a global multiregional input-output model. Overall, distribution of the BRI's environmental footprints shows strong spatial heterogeneity, amongst China, India and Russia have the highest total environmental footprints. Furthermore, reverse patterns of spatial distribution can be observed between the total and per capita footprints of BRI nations. When it comes to the global scale, the BRI as a whole is found to be a net exporter of trade-embodied flows except for virtual water. Remarkably, 29% of the BRI nations experience a role transition in supply chains across scales, either from net exporters on the BRI level to net importers on the global level, or in reverse. Our findings provide a holistic picture of environmental footprints at scales ranging from single nations, regions, BRI, and even globe, highlighting the significance of a global view in finding ways to tackle environmental challenges and fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals throughout the BRI countries by 2030.","[Fang, Kai; Wang, Siqi; He, Jianjian] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Fang, Kai] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Social Welf & Governance, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Song, Junnian] Jilin Univ, Coll New Energy & Environm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Fang, Chuanglin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xiaoping] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Jilin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Qingdao University of Science & Technology","Fang, K (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.;Fang, K (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Social Welf & Governance, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.;Jia, XP (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China.",fangk@zju.edu.cn; jiaxp@qust.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074193, 71704157, 41771575]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province for Distinguished Young Scholars [LR19G030001]; Top Young Talent of Ten-Thousand Talents Program of Zhejiang Province; National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFE0201400]; Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE) [XDA20040400]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province for Distinguished Young Scholars; Top Young Talent of Ten-Thousand Talents Program of Zhejiang Province; National Key R&D Program of China; Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE),"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72074193, 71704157, 41771575), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE) (XDA20040400), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province for Distinguished Young Scholars (LR19G030001), the Top Young Talent of Ten-Thousand Talents Program of Zhejiang Province, and the National Key R&D Program of China (2020YFE0201400).",,60,77,81,15,258,,,,0921-3449,1879-0658,,,,JAN,2021,164,,,,,,,,105068,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105068,,,,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aspect of coordination is rarely included in the assessment of sustainability and current assessment methodologies do not allow conclusions about the linkage between coordination and sustainability. This paper analyzes the state of the art in the assessment of agri-food supply chain sustainability based on a structured literature review. Following the structured review that includes category analysis and content analysis, we develop a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for agri-food chains across multiple stages. The novelty of the framework is to incorporate the dimension of coordination across chain stages as a critical sustainability dimension. The study contributes to research on the assessment of agrifood supply chain sustainability by incorporating the role of coordination across chain stages and its relationship with economic, environmental, and social performance. This essential relationship between coordination and sustainability offers several areas of interest for future research. The study also contributes to practice by providing scholars, chain actors, and policymakers with directions for improving sustainable strategies.","[Moreno-Miranda, Carlos; Dries, Liesbeth] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Moreno-Miranda, Carlos] Tech Univ Ambato, Fac Food Engn & Biotechnol, Av Chasquis & Rio Payamino, Ambato 180104, Ecuador",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Tecnica de Ambato,"Moreno-Miranda, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",carlos.morenomiranda@wur.nl; liesbeth.dries@wur.nl,,,Technical University of Ambato-Ecuador [UTA-1887CU-P-2018]; European Union [678024],Technical University of Ambato-Ecuador; European Union(European Union (EU)),"This research was financially supported by the Technical University of Ambato-Ecuador, throughout the agreement UTA-1887CU-P-2018, and by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 678024.",,121,37,39,4,88,,,,0921-8009,1873-6106,,,,FEB,2022,192,,,,,,,,107265,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107265,,NOV 2021,,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The interplay between downstream interfaces (consumers-retailers; consumers-food service businesses; consumers-households) of food supply chain and areas of food waste accumulation is discussed in the article. The findings are based on a two-step method: first, a systematic literature review of the published studies on food waste between 2008 and 2020, and second, theme development to understand food waste at the three interfaces and to develop propositions for future research. The propositions are strategic interventions to provide managerial recommendations for food waste reduction involving downstream food supply chain stakeholders. The findings highlight the conundrum of balancing conflicting stakeholder perspectives within triple bottom line dimensions to tackle food waste: economic and social dimensions of triple bottom line take priority over the environmental dimension. Testing the propositions as part of future research will help to further streamline the policy recommendations to reduce food waste at the downstream part of the supply chain.","[Bhattacharya, Ananya; Prajogo, Daniel] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zutshi, Ambika] Deakin Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Deakin University,"Bhattacharya, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ananya.bhattacharya@monash.edu,,,,,,,123,4,4,1,16,,,,1448-6563,2159-5356,,,,OCT 2,2022,29,4,,,,,314,343,,10.1080/14486563.2022.2139768,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14486563.2022.2139768,,NOV 2022,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The government also actively applies technologies to traditional fields to promote social progress. In agriculture, the agricultural supply chain has a low information level and low degree of digitization. The application of blockchain technology in agriculture offers exceptional advantages because of its decentralization, openness, and transparency. Based on the application of blockchain in an agricultural scenario, an evolutionary game model made up of governments, telecom operators, and agricultural enterprises was established to analyze the model's equilibrium stability and evolutionary stable strategy. Then, numerical simulation was carried out to study the influence of the initial green level, equipment deployment cost, technology operation cost, and other core factors on the tripartite evolution behaviour. The results show that each factor influences the behaviour of a third party in different ways. Finally, according to the simulation results, this paper puts forward practical suggestions, explores the long-term impact of the application cost and sustainable income of blockchain technology on cooperation, and provides new ideas for the governance of China's traditional fields from the perspective of new technology application.","[Song, Luona; Jin, Chunhua] Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100192, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yiqing] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Elect Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Chang, Zixi] Hebei Univ Sci & Technol, FedUni Informat Engn Inst, Shijiazhuang 050018, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Nicolas, Merveille] Univ Quebec Montreal, Strategy & Social & Environm Responsibil Dept, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Beijing Information Science & Technology University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Hebei University of Science & Technology; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Song, LA (corresponding author), Beijing Informat Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100192, Peoples R China.",songlona@bistu.edu.cn; luoyiqing@bupt.edu.cn; changzixi@stu.hebust.edu.cn; chhking@bistu.edu.cn; merveille.nicolas@uqam.ca,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB1405005],National Key R&D Program of China,FundingThis research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2019YFB1405005).,,39,33,34,24,222,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB,2022,14,3,,,,,,,1470,10.3390/su14031470,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031470,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Until recently, fisheries managers and researchers have struggled to develop effective methods and data for social and economic analysis that can integrate with the predominantly biological approaches to fisheries management. The field is now growing fast, however, and globally, researchers are developing and testing new methods. This paper uses three divergent case studies to demonstrate the value of using qualitative social science approaches to complement more conventional quantitative methods to improve the knowledge base for fisheries management. In all three cases, qualitative interview and document review methods enabled broad surveying to explore the research questions in particular contexts and identified where quantitative tools could be most usefully applied. In the first case (the contribution of commercial fisheries to coastal communities in eastern Australia), a wellbeing analysis identified the social benefits from particular fisheries, which can be used to identify the social impacts of different fisheries management policies. In the second case (a gender analysis of fisheries of small islands in the Pacific), analysis outlined opportunities and constraints along fisheries supply chains, illuminated factors inhibiting community development and identified ecological factors that are typically overlooked in conventional fisheries management. In the third case (sea cucumber fisheries in Papua New Guinea), an interactive governance analysis assessed how well fisheries management tools fit the ecological, social and economic reality of the fishery and the trade in its products, including market influences and stakeholder values. The qualitative approach adopted in these three case studies adds a new dimension to understanding fisheries that is not possible with a focus solely on quantitative data. With the development of new policies on release programs (stock enhancement, restocking) and artificial reefs, and the momentum to use these interventions from recreational fishing groups, the qualitative approach will provide an important contribution to understanding their wider costs and benefits.

The sustainable development goals (SDGs), though seeing trade as a means to support their achievement, recognise the need to address potential negative social and environmental impacts. It is therefore important to assess the contribution of international trade to the SDGs in commodity production areas. The environmental impacts of commodity production are widely acknowledged, but much less is known about its social impacts, and how this affects poverty reduction objectives across different dimensions. Impacts on human wellbeing and equity depend on a multitude of factors, including resources, systemic conditions and outputs of production. Through a broad literature review on soy, coffee, cocoa and palm oil, we show how studies have addressed different aspects of these factors and their impacts. The paper demonstrates how efforts by actors in global supply chains are related to a large number of SDGs and their targets. We link the social impacts and factors to the SDGs and a list of potential indicators and variables to guide operationalisation of assessments in new empirical studies.","[Schaafsma, Marije; Dreoni, Ilda] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton, England; [Schaafsma, Marije] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dreoni, Ilda; Matthews, Zoe] Univ Southampton, Dept Social Stat & Demog, Southampton, England; [Ayompe, Lacour Mody; Egoh, Benis N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Ekayana, Dewa Putu; Mumbunan, Sonny] Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Ctr Climate & Sustainable Finance, Depok, Indonesia; [Ekayana, Dewa Putu] Minist Finance Republ Indonesia, Ctr Climate Finance & Multilateral Policy, Fiscal Policy Agcy, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Favareto, Arilson] Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modeling & Appl Social Sci, Santo Andre, Brazil; [Favareto, Arilson; Nakagawa, Louise] Brazilian Ctr Anal & Planning, Cebrap Sustainabil, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mumbunan, Sonny] World Resources Inst WRI Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Ngouhouo-poufoun, Jonas] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA Cameroon, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Ngouhouo-poufoun, Jonas] Congo Basin Inst CBI, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Sassen, Marieke] UN Environm Programme World Conservat Monitoring, Cambridge, England; [Sassen, Marieke] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Uehara, Thiago Kanashiro] Royal Inst Int Affairs, Environm & Soc Programme, London, England; [Uehara, Thiago Kanashiro] Sao Paulo Sch Business Adm EAESP, Fdn Getulio Vargas, Ctr Eth Transparency Integricy & Compliance Studi, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of Southampton; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Southampton; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Indonesia; Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia; Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC); Wageningen University & Research,"Schaafsma, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Boelelaan 1111, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.schaafsma@vu.nl,,,"UK Research and Innovation's Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI GCRF) through the Trade, Development and the Environment Hub project [ES/S008160/1]; GCRF [ES/S008160/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research and Innovation's Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI GCRF) through the Trade, Development and the Environment Hub project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI))","We acknowledge funding from the UK Research and Innovation's Global Challenges Research Fund (UKRI GCRF) through the Trade, Development and the Environment Hub project (project number ES/S008160/1).",,309,9,9,13,49,,,,0968-0802,1099-1719,,,,AUG,2023,31,4,,,,,2363,2385,,10.1002/sd.2515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sd.2515,,FEB 2023,,Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning,,Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Public Administration,,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Calls for conceptual and practical approaches on how to address climate change have been taken up in the literature. The resilience concept as a comprehensive theory-driven approach to address climate change has only recently increased in importance. Limited research has been undertaken concerning tourism and resilience from a network governance point of view. We analyze tourism supply chain networks with regard to resilience to climate change at the municipal governance scale of three Alpine villages. We compare these with a planned destination management organization (DMO) as a governance entity of the same three municipalities on the regional scale. Network measures are analyzed via a quantitative social network analysis (SNA) focusing on resilience from a tourism governance point of view. Results indicate higher resilience of the regional DMO because of a more flexible and diverse governance structure, more centralized steering of fast collective action, and improved innovative capacity, because of higher modularity and better core- periphery integration. Interpretations of quantitative results have been qualitatively validated by interviews and a workshop. We conclude that adaptation of tourism-dependent municipalities to gradual climate change should be dealt with at a regional governance scale and adaptation to sudden changes at a municipal scale. Overall, DMO building at a regional scale may enhance the resilience of tourism destinations, if the municipalities are well integrated.","[Luthe, Tobias] Univ Appl Sci Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland; [Luthe, Tobias] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Key Qualificat, Freiburg, Germany; [Wyss, Romano] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Human Environm Relat Urban Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Wyss, Romano] Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Freiburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Munich,"Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Chur, Inst Tourism & Leisure, Chur, Switzerland.;Luthe, T (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Ctr Key Qualificat, Freiburg, Germany.",,,,Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS); Interreg Alpine Space program,Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS); Interreg Alpine Space program,"We acknowledge funding from the Swiss Network of International Studies (SNIS) and from the Interreg Alpine Space program.

We hand-collect data on the geographical distance of 29,111 pairs of Chinese A-share listed companies and their top-five customers from 2009 to 2022. First, we find that CGP promotes firms' ESG performance. The results still hold after considering the exogenous influence of the introduction of high-speed rail on CGP. Second, cross-sectional analysis shows that CGP exerts a more pronounced influence on firms with severe information asymmetry. Third, impact channel tests indicate that CGP promotes firms' ESG performance by increasing firms' cash flows. Fourth, the impact of CGP is more obvious when customers have stronger risk management motivation.

To understand the social implications of the implementation of the CE, a semi-systematic literature review was completed evalu-ating the variables of equity, diversity, collaboration, quality of life, maturity, and governance as derived from a capabilities approach. At a societal level, this article explores the main demands and contributions of the CE to society and identifies the inconsistencies in the literature in assessing the CE as a strategy for development, counterposing views of the CE's contribution to the socioeconomic system. Furthermore, the analysis proposes a set of socioeconomic strategies that can aid a CE implementation.

A comprehensive review of the sustainability impacts of extractions of these minerals at a global level, however, is lacking. Using coverage as a proxy of concerns and attention, this study analyzed news media stories over the 2015-2021 period to identify specific issues concerning the social and environmental impacts of eight EVs minerals. Based on keywords per news story as an indicator of media attention, impact hotspots are mapped across multiple indicators for the scope and intensity of issues. Our analysis indicates that the impacts that received the most attention were related to indigenous rights, access to material and immaterial resources, social benefits, and conflicts. In particular, the extraction of copper, aluminum, cobalt, and manganese received relatively high coverage on most social impacts, whereas cobalt and graphite received the most intensive media attention. Given the global nature of the EV mineral supply chain and new proposed mining projects, the insights on impact hotpots indicate where to focus policy efforts to mitigate negative impacts. We conclude by discussing pressing issues about supply shortage, international governance, and opportunities regarding alternative models for more sustainable mineral extractions of these minerals.","[Agusdinata, Datu Buyung; Liu, Wenjuan] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Agusdinata, Datu Buyung] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 777 E Univ Dr, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Agusdinata, DB (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, 777 E Univ Dr, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",bagusdin@asu.edu,,,,,,,171,28,28,15,44,,,,2214-790X,2214-7918,,,,MAR,2023,13,,,,,,,,101231,10.1016/j.exis.2023.101231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2023.101231,,FEB 2023,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To achieve this, 16 indicators, including general publication characteristics, the chain participants, the allocation of activities, their effect on the ecosystem, and mode of governance and coordination were identified. Besides pointing out the potential impacts of Asian timber VCs on the environment and livelihoods, this review demonstrates that wood-based firms insert themselves into an interlinked network and consider their geographical scope, governance, cooperation and overall performance. Our findings clearly expose notable knowledge gaps and call for a broader geographic coverage, as well as more transparent and quantitative assessments.

In addition to this direct link, whether corporate governance moderates this relation or not is tested. The analysis of data collected for 117 countries covers the period from 2007 to 2016. Primarily, the study provides robust evidence that green logistics performance has a significant and positive association with the existence and the number of sustainability reports within the logistics sector. This association is validated for the composite Logistics Performance Index (LPI) as well as all six individual logistics performance indicators. Furthermore, moderation analysis indicated that in weak corporate governance environments characterized by ineffective boards of directors, the logistics performance and sustainability reporting link is stronger. This means that sustainability reporting fills the gap arising from poor corporate governance. This study extends existing green supply chain management literature by testing, for the first time, the association between green logistics practices and sustainability reporting. It is hoped that it helps to align the logistics sector with more eco-friendly practices and alleviate growing concerns of environmental degradation it is assumed to cause. In the end, the study provides implications for sector representatives, supply-chain managers, and developing countries in particular. It suggests guidelines about how to improve each dimension of six LPI to contribute to the sustainable development of the sector. Moreover, as one of the dimensions of this study is sustainability reporting, communication of sustainable supply chain practices to customers and other stakeholders may help supply chain managers augment the competitive posture of companies in the market. The sector can benefit from the Global Reporting Initiative's individual metrics including materials usage, energy efficiency, recycling, and waste management metrics in developing environmentally friendly supply chains. The findings are particularly relevant for developing countries which are quite low scorers in terms of LPI than developed countries. Engaging in green logistics practices and developing policies accordingly may help them attenuate growing international environmental concerns and overcome trade barriers in international trade. The highlighted dimensions of green logistics performance may foster the circular economy while promoting the overall economic development of the countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze the large spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute, or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments, NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more effective interventions.","[Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Thorlakson, Tannis] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Universite Catholique Louvain; Stanford University,"Lambin, EF (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Lambin, EF (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Lambin, EF (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Earth & Climate Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",elambin@stanford.edu; thorlaks@stanford.edu,,,,,,,132,148,159,10,113,,,,1543-5938,,978-0-8243-2343-1,,,,2018,43,,,,,,369,393,,10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025931,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025931,,,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we an agent-based model to assess effectiveness, equity, and transaction costs of four archetypal governance interventions (weak regulation to natural resource access, command and control, supply chain sustainability, and multi-stakeholder coalitions) under different environmental and social conditions. We find that all ventions are effective in reducing deforestation, albeit to varying degrees, and not all are equitable. Intervention performance varies significantly across conditions, and on average, multi-stakeholder coalitions provide the best balance between effectiveness and equity.

Various areas of management such as purchasing, logistics and strategy have critically evaluated theories to move these fields of management forward. However, no such work exists in the area of voluntary standards. Voluntary standards, such as standards for quality, environmental management and social responsibility have been covered extensively in research studies and substantial knowledge exists in terms of their diffusion, adoption, impact and governance. The studies adopt different theoretical perspectives. A number of literature reviews on voluntary standards exist; however, none of the papers so far has critically scrutinized the theoretical underpinnings of these studies. This paper, therefore, fills an important gap in the literature by providing a critical review of theories that contribute to understanding the issues pertinent to voluntary standards. Inductive and deductive search methods are applied considering the ten most prominent voluntary standards (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS, 18001, ISO 26000, EMAS, AA1000, SA8000, FSC, MSC, and FairTrade). Nine theories (clustered as Corporate Nature Theories, External (Stakeholder) Perspective Theories and Process and Attitude Perspective Theories) that have been previously employed are scrutinized. The paper analyses the evolution of theoretical underpinnings of 62 papers published in high ranked journals between 2001 and 2016. The analysis demonstrates a dominant use of Corporate Nature Theories and External (Stakeholder) Perspective Theories and shows the evolution of the field. The paper concludes by linking the theories to key research areas in voluntary standards and aids researchers by identifying theories that are promising in terms of their applicability to explore future research paths in this field of study.

Using dynamic capability theory, this study investigated the mechanism by which interorganizational governance influences project resilience. According to the literature and theoretical analysis, resource reconfiguration is identified as a mediator between interorganizational governance and project resilience. It was conducted by a quantitative analysis of a survey of the engineering industry in China using structural equation modeling. The findings show that both contractual governance and relational governance are enablers of project resilience. This unpacks how this relationship can be achieved through resource reconfiguration as the mediator and contract governance partially function through relational elements.

The findings are expected to inform policies and practices on smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil supply chains and identify evidence gaps where future primary studies and evidence syntheses can contribute. Methods We will develop a guiding framework of interventions through other works on supply chain instruments. We will then construct a test library of 39 items through field expert consultations and snowballing using literature search algorithms. The search will cover four publication databases, five bibliographic databases, and 13 topical and organizational websites. We will search for existing evidence syntheses and primary research studies in Southeast Asia countries published between 2008 and 2021. This systematic map will only include English language articles due to our limited capacity. We will screen the search results at the title/abstract and the full-text levels. Numbers of included/excluded items and reasons for exclusion will be noted and visualized via a ROSES flow diagram. We will develop a data extraction form for assessing data useful for reporting current trends of smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil initiatives. A random sample of 20% of the included articles will be assessed for validity using Joanne Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist. We will then organize and summarize the data according to the defined PICO.","[Lai, Jia Yen; Hamzah, Nurfatin] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Mardiyaningsih, Dyah Ita] Bogor Agr Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev Studies CARDS, Bogor, Indonesia; [Rahmadian, Faris] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hamzah, Nurfatin] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Sci & Marine Environm, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Malaysia; Bogor Agricultural University; Wageningen University & Research; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu,"Lai, JY (corresponding author), Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",jiayen.lai@monash.edu,,,"School of Arts and Social Science, Monash University Malaysia [IRG-2021-17]","School of Arts and Social Science, Monash University Malaysia","This study is funded by the Seed Grants 2021 of the School of Arts and Social Science, Monash University Malaysia (Grant Reference ID: IRG-2021-17).",,45,2,2,4,12,,,,,2047-2382,,,,SEP 1,2022,11,1,,,,,,,28,10.1186/s13750-022-00283-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-022-00283-x,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These networks fill the regulatory gaps created when global trade increases the exploitation of global commons resources and shifts production to exporting countries with lax environmental standards. As critics of trade liberalization have noted, public responses often are inadequate to address the attendant environmental harms. This Article uses empirical data to examine how private contracting regulates firm behavior, focusing on supply-chain contracting. The Article shows that more than half of the largest firms in eight retail and industrial sectors impose environmental requirements on their domestic and foreign suppliers. This contracting, which the Article terms '' the new Wal-Mart effect,'' reduces externalities by translating a complex mix Of social, economic, and legal incentives for environmental protection into private contractual requirements. After demonstrating that private environmental contracting is an important part of global environmental governance, the Article examines the efficacy and accountability of this regime. The Article concludes that the private contracting regime often is preferable to the alternatives: lax national and international regulation of firms in many exporting countries, and markets that lack private environmental contracting. Finding much promise in the private contracting regime, the Article concludes by suggesting new strategies for governments, nongovernmental organizations, and firms.","Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Regulatory Program, Nashville, TN 37240 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Vandenbergh, MP (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Regulatory Program, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.",,,,,,,,115,110,115,0,14,,,,0041-5650,,,,,APR,2007,54,4,,,,,913,970,,,,,,,Law,,Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, studies have focused only on unilateral governance. Given the inherent limitations and research gaps, how to empower firms' green total factor productivity through multi-factors resonance has become an urgent issue. For this purpose, using the micro-data of Chinese listed enterprises from 2009 to 2018, a framework from digital and institutional governance for analyzing synergies was defined through the SBM, entropy weight TOPSIS, and system coupling models that measured green total factor productivity and co-evolution of data and environmental governance factors. Their causal linkages were further explored through the fixed-effects model, which not only applies digital governance inclusion as an emerging research touchpoint to theoretical research on green development, but also provides China's micro-empirical references for global digitally-empowered environmental governance. The study found that: (1) The synergy between multi-factors stimulated green total factor productivity, but did not significantly drive a dramatic increase in its rise. (2) Influence mechanisms confirmed that endowments matching unlock human and innovation dividends, optimizing skill structure and expanding innovation boundary, thus promoting green efficiency. (3) The spillover paths indicated that the multi-endowments effect creates secondary diffusion upstream and downstream along the supply chain, which is not only constrained by a significant single threshold, but also exhibits industry heterogeneity. This study provides coping strategies for global policymakers to build a digital green development engine in all fields and multiple dimensions.","[She, Yanan; Wang, Huan; Zhen, Shangsong; Peng, Yue; Wang, Wei; Liu, Yunqiang] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, 211 Huimin Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University,"Liu, YQ (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Management, 211 Huimin Rd, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",liuyunqiang@sicau.edu.cn,,,Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [24BGL177]; Sichuan Philosophy and Social Science Planning Fund [SCJJ24ND056]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72103152]; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program [2022JDTD0022],Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences; Sichuan Philosophy and Social Science Planning Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program,This work was supported by the Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences [grant number 24BGL177] ; the Sichuan Philosophy and Social Science Planning Fund [grant number SCJJ24ND056] ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 72103152] ; and the Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program [grant number 2022JDTD0022] .,,226,0,0,27,27,,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,FEB,2025,208,,,,,,,,115053,10.1016/j.rser.2024.115053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2024.115053,,NOV 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Indeed, many sectors including forest-risk commodities (FRCs) like soy and beef from Brazil remain largely unregulated. This article analyzes ongoing policy-making processes at European Union level to adopt new regulations for reducing accountability gaps: one regulation of FRCs and one general, cross-sectoral directive on human rights and environmental due diligence. This article draws on and aims to contribute to previous research into foreign corporate accountability, therein analytically distinguishing between input, output, and surrogate accountability. This study shows that new policies will likely be more comprehensive than previous supply chain regulations, while their specific institutional design and stringency are highly contested. More in general, we argue that for hardening corporate accountability, due diligence politics will need to confront important governance challenges that have limited the potential of previous regulations, such as a lack of consequentiality of reporting obligations, weak state monitoring, limited stakeholder involvement, and difficulties to establish legal liability.","[Schilling-Vacaflor, Almut; Lenschow, Andrea] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Social Sci, Seminarstr 33, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Schilling-Vacaflor, A (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Inst Social Sci, Seminarstr 33, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany.",aschillingva@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [LE 2396/4-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under Grant No. LE 2396/4-1 through the project GOVERNECT - Governance of Environmental Sustainability in Telecoupled Systems of Global Interregional Connectedness (see https://www.researchgate.net/project/Governance-of-Environmental-Sustainability-inTelecoupled-Systems-of-Global-Inter-Regional-Connectedness-GOVERNECT).,,76,45,48,6,44,,,,1748-5983,1748-5991,,,,JUL,2023,17,3,,,,,677,693,,10.1111/rego.12402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rego.12402,,MAY 2021,,Law; Political Science; Public Administration,,Government & Law; Public Administration,,,Green Published,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We trace these environmental and social impacts across the EU's trading partners to identify sectoral and regional hotspots of international spillovers embodied in the EU's consumer demand. We estimate that the EU's consumption is associated with significant spillover impacts primarily in Central Asia, Asia Pacific, and Africa. We contextualise these results within a three-pillar framework to highlight the importance of a comprehensive and partnershipbased approach to curbing environmental and social spillovers embodied in the EU's consumption of raw materials. Specifically, we highlight three potential practical policy strategies: leveraging EU domestic instruments and regulations, strengthening the Green Deal and SDG diplomacy and financing, and promoting responsible consumption, recycling and innovation.

Moreover, we find that customer firms with better sustainability performance, those operating in competitive industries, and state-owned customer firms are more inclined to opt for sustainable suppliers. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that the positive influence of vendors' sustainability performance on the likelihood of being selected is more significant for vendors who hold non-leading industrial positions or face high uncertainty. In addition, by focusing on actual customer-supplier relationships, we find that customer firms benefit from collaborating with more sustainable suppliers.

Although prevalent in developed countries, the phenomenon is emerging in developing countries. Using certification schemes, actors behind these governance arrangements exercise responsibilities over the food system through the enforcement of best practices, the promotion and sale of certified products, and the communication of diverse value-laden product attributes to consumers through labels. In Ghana, a new food safety governance arrangement - the Ghana Green Label Foundation - has emerged through the collaboration of multiple state and non-state actors. The arrangement represents the first successful introduction of a co-regulation regime in Ghana, achieving local market adoption and consumer patronage. This article examines the evolution of the Foundation, highlighting its trajectory towards market entry, for possible transfer of lessons into other geographic contexts. The location of this study, with a large informal food market sector, as well as the interdependence on peripheral areas and other farther regions for food supply, provide a unique context for adding to the international food governance literature.

Moreover, this paper aims to deepen the understanding of environmental uncertainty's moderating effect on the association between the trust relationship with suppliers (TRS) and reciprocity.Design/methodology/approachStructural equation modeling has been used to test the hypotheses on 361 Chinese manufacturing firms' managers and independent directors during the COVID-19 crisis.FindingsThe results reveal that reciprocity positively enhances three dimensions of manufacturer resilience, namely, preparedness, responsiveness and recovery capability. Reciprocity positively mediates the relationships between TRS and preparedness, responsiveness and recovery capability. Moreover, environmental uncertainty moderates the association between TRS and reciprocity.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the critical role of reciprocity, the relational governance approach, in enhancing manufacturer resilience in practice. This paper suggests that during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, managers should adopt trust and reciprocity in supplier relationship governance to strengthen the resilience of manufacturing companies and adapt effective strategies according to the environment.Originality/valueThis study is unique in developing new scales of manufacturer resilience through interviews and surveys with Chinese manufacturers and theoretical research. Based on the social capital theory and social exchange theory, this study shed light on the role of trust and reciprocity. It also bridges relational governance theory with the literature on manufacturing firm resilience literature to help manufacturers better understand the transdisciplinary links between relationship management and resilient operations in emergencies.","[Yang, Jianhua; Liu, Yuying; Kholaif, Moustafa Mohamed Nazief Haggag Kotb] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kholaif, Moustafa Mohamed Nazief Haggag Kotb] Tanta Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Accounting, Tanta, Egypt",University of Science & Technology Beijing; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University,"Liu, YY (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",B20190409@xs.ustb.edu.cn; liuyuying_ustb@163.com; moustafahaggag87@163.com,,,"Social Science Fund Base Project of Beijing, China; [19JDGLA001]","Social Science Fund Base Project of Beijing, China;","Funding: This paper has been funded by the Social Science Fund Base Project of Beijing, China (19JDGLA001).",,121,4,4,7,50,,,,0368-492X,1758-7883,,,,FEB 13,2024,53,3,,,,,960,989,,10.1108/K-08-2022-1198,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-08-2022-1198,,DEC 2022,,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",,Computer Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our paper answers this question by studying how corporate environmental responsibility is affected when a firm's major customer is the government. Using a two-way fixed effects model with a sample of 5672 Chinese manufacturing firms, we show that having a government customer is associated with a 15% higher corporate environmental responsibility score. Moreover, a 10% increase in the share of government purchase in the supplier's sales revenue is associated with up to a 6% increase in the suppliers' corporate environmental responsibility score. The relative bargaining advantage in the supply chain plays a moderating role in the association between a major government customer and suppliers' corporate environmental responsibility efforts, where the positive impact is more pronounced in firms operating in competitive industries, at a small scale, and with high trade credit. Our paper thus highlights visible business relationship as a new driving force for corporate environmental responsibility. Our results also suggest that when transacting business with their suppliers, local governments should reconsider how to utilize their advantageous positions to encourage firms to take more environmental responsibility.","[Yu, Xiaojun] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiang; Zhang, Lin] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",orlandoyu@cueb.edu.cn; qli365@cityu.edu.hk; l.zhang@cityu.edu.hk,,,"Research Grants from the Capital University of Economics and Business [01592354413006]; Beijing International Finance Society [BIFS242004]; City University of Hong Kong [7005726, 7020099]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [CityU146/23]",Research Grants from the Capital University of Economics and Business; Beijing International Finance Society; City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"The work described in this paper was supported by Research Grants from the Capital University of Economics and Business (Project No. 01592354413006) , Beijing International Finance Society (Project No. BIFS242004) , the City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7005726 & 7020099) , and the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (N_CityU146/23) .",,125,2,2,22,36,,,,0148-2963,1873-7978,,,,OCT,2024,183,,,,,,,,114853,10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.114853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.114853,,JUL 2024,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This new style of inquiry is seen as adding to the repertoire of political strategies and potential geographies of responsibility and extending notions of ethical behaviours. Issues relating to the assemblage of PSPE as a distinctive approach to knowledge production are considered and situated in the Australasian context. Discussion focuses especially on insight about the use of PSPE derived from three illustrative research case studies (a project on learning challenges in sheep meat and dairy supply chain realignment, tensions around fisheries management in New Zealand and an international workshop series on the topic of governmentality). The case studies provide a lens on the socio-spatial relationships between globalisation and governance and interrogate the value of PSPE for understanding the connections between individual choices, governing practices and the construction of the globalising economy. The PSPE approach if actively incorporated into research processes may have important implications for future relationships between social responsibility, national economic development and globalisation.","Univ Auckland, Sch Geog Geol & Environm Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Le Heron, R (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Geog Geol & Environm Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",r.leheron@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,34,30,30,0,10,,,,1360-7456,1467-8373,,,,APR,2007,48,1,,,,,26,40,,10.1111/j.1467-8373.2007.00327.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8373.2007.00327.x,,,,Area Studies; Geography,,Area Studies; Geography,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

One reason for this is the de-localization of modern food systems, which is correlating with processes of globalization and differentiation (horizontally by different food groups, vertically by value creation stages). This is leading to an increasing complexity and declining transparency of production-, process-and value chains within food markets. Moreover, there is evidence for strong concentration processes especially within the German food retail sector, where a few large competitors divide the market among themselves. Because of that, food markets are perceived to be hardly accessible for governance approaches and possibilities of coordination on municipal levels, such as strengthening ecological sustainability or regional identity. But at the same time, there is a variety of companies or 'market actors' producing, processing and retailing food, located within municipalities and embedded in and connected to each other via food markets on municipal, regional, national and international levels. The existence of these food supply market networks within municipalities are opening up the possibility of capturing and describing them as well as analyzing their structures with methods of social network analysis (SNA). While analyzing the horizontal market networks of food supply within two South-German municipalities, the present study intends to develop a systematic approach for capturing market structures of food supply on municipal levels and - building on this - deriving related governance approaches and coordination possibilities.","[Sipple, David; Schanz, Heiner] Univ Freiburg, Environm Governance, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Sipple, D (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Environm Governance, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,112,4,4,3,28,,,,0044-3751,2365-7693,,,,MAR,2019,63,1,,,,,1,22,,10.1515/zfw-2018-0024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zfw-2018-0024,,,,Economics; Geography,,Business & Economics; Geography,,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the existing literature fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of these partnerships. The present research contributes to understanding the nature and structure of the buyers' partnerships for enhancing sustainable sourcing. A structured review methodology is adopted to collect information about supply chain partnerships from the literature on sustainable sourcing. Then, a content analysis is conducted on the collected information using a comprehensive partnership framework, i.e., the McNamara framework. The framework suggests ten interconnected facets to characterize the structure of a partnership and classifies the nature of partnerships into three categories called cooperation, coordination, and collaboration. The findings indicate that cooperative partnerships are not effective for promoting sustainable sourcing as they lack the exchange of resources between the participating organizations. In contrast, coordinative partnerships are mainly effective for tactical and operational initiatives to address reactive, end-of-pipe solutions for sustainable sourcing. Finally, collaborative partnerships should be mainly initiated at the strategic level to design proactive solutions for sustainable sourcing. Some practical implications are provided to facilitate the transition of supply chains to sustainability. Some open questions for future research are also provided.","[Zarei, Hamid; Rasti-Barzoki, Morteza] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 84156-83111, Esfahan, Iran; [Zarei, Hamid] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Transportat Engn, 84156-83111, Esfahan, Iran; [Rasti-Barzoki, Morteza; Altmann, Joern] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Coll Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Rasti-Barzoki, Morteza; Altmann, Joern] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Grad Sch Engn Practice, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Egger, Bernhard] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Altmann, Joern] Seoul Natl Univ, Integrated Major Smart City Global Convergence, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Isfahan University of Technology; Isfahan University of Technology; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Rasti-Barzoki, M (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 84156-83111, Esfahan, Iran.;Rasti-Barzoki, M (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Coll Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Rasti-Barzoki, M (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Grad Sch Engn Practice, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",rasti@cc.iut.ac.ir,,,,,,,92,1,1,5,30,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,JUL,2023,30,31,,,,,76491,76514,,10.1007/s11356-023-27541-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27541-w,,JUN 2023,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As this prevents them from coherently turning sustainability into action, this paper focuses on how companies can align logistics environmental sustainability with corporate strategies. We conducted multiple embedded case research involving logistics service providers (LSPs) and shippers operating in the Italian context. We selected 13 companies (6 LSPs and 7 shippers) and conducted semi-structured interviews to contextualise and elaborate the extant theory. Results highlight that companies seem more motivated by the need to comply with regulations or to protect their environmental reputation than by a genuine understanding of the actual need for sustainability. A framework is proposed to foster the alignment of logistics environmental sustainability with corporate strategy, underpinned by five main dimensions: degree of awareness, degree of formalisation, measurement systems, governance and accountability, and budget allocation.","[Prataviera, Lorenzo Bruno] Cranfield Sch Management, Ctr Logist Procurement & Supply Chain Management, Bedford, England; [Creazza, Alessandro] LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Ind Engn, Castellanza, Italy; [Perotti, Sara] Dept Management, Econ, Ind Engn, Politecn Milano, Milan, Italy; [Rodrigues, Vasco Sanchez] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, Wales; [Prataviera, Lorenzo Bruno] Coll Rd,Wharley End, Bedford MK43 0AL, England",Cranfield University; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc; Polytechnic University of Milan; Cardiff University,"Prataviera, LB (corresponding author), Coll Rd,Wharley End, Bedford MK43 0AL, England.",lorenzo.prataviera@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,75,6,6,8,34,,,,1367-5567,1469-848X,,,,2023 JUL 4,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13675567.2023.2230916,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13675567.2023.2230916,,JUL 2023,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes economic growth in producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on economic and political power to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching). In the multiple networks that compose global palm oil provision today, different programmers and switchers play critical roles. This is briefly illustrated in this paper on the basis of different cases of active steering in global palm oil provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The conventional logic is that ecolabels meet consumer demand for certified sustainable seafood, with good players rewarded with price premiums or market share and bad players punished by reduced sales. Empirically, however, in the markets where ecolabeling has taken hold, retailers and brandsrather than consumersare demanding sustainable sourcing, to build and protect their reputation. The aim of this paper is to devise a more accurate logic for understanding the sustainable seafood movement, using a qualitative literature review and reflection on our previous research. We find that replacing the consumer-driven logic with a retailer/brand-driven logic does not go far enough in making research into the sustainable seafood movement more useful. Governance is a concert and cannot be adequately explained through individual actor groups. We propose a new logic going beyond consumer- or retailer/brand-driven models, and call on researchers to build on the partial pictures given by studies on prices and willingness-to-pay, investigating more fully the motivations of actors in the sustainable seafood movement, and considering audience beyond the direct consumption of the product in question.","[Barclay, Kate] UTS, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sch Int Studies, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Miller, Alice] Wageningen Univ WUR, Environm Policy Grp, BESTTuna Project, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Technology Sydney; Wageningen University & Research,"Barclay, K (corresponding author), UTS, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sch Int Studies, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Kate.Barclay@uts.edu.au; ammmiller@gmail.com,,,"WWF; United Nations Development Programme, Greenpeace; Japan Foundation; BESTTuna project at Wageningen University in the Netherlands","WWF; United Nations Development Programme, Greenpeace; Japan Foundation; BESTTuna project at Wageningen University in the Netherlands","Research projects that led to the thinking behind this paper have been supported by a number of organizations: WWF, the United Nations Development Programme, Greenpeace and the Japan Foundation (KB) and the BESTTuna project at Wageningen University in the Netherlands (AM).

This study delves into how corporate governance and its various dimensions influence carbon neutrality within organizations, with a specific focus on the Iron-Ore sector in China - a notable contributor to carbon emissions in the context of digital economic growth. The research also investigates the role of policy robustness in enhancing carbon neutrality, both as a direct influence and as a potential moderator in the relationship between corporate governance and carbon neutrality. Utilizing a panel data methodology, the study analyzes data from 103 organizations across a threeyear span, from 2017 to 2019. The findings, derived from stepwise regression analysis, underscore the importance of factors such as environmental disclosure, policy robustness, the presence of institutional investors, corporate governance practices, and organizational size in steering towards carbon neutrality. These insights are crucial in understanding the intricate interplay between these variables and carbon neutrality in the Iron Ore sector, particularly under the umbrella of the expanding digital economy. The study concludes that organizations can significantly enhance their carbon neutrality - thereby positioning themselves as frontrunners in sustainable practices - through improved environmental disclosure, strengthened policy robustness, and a focus on robust corporate governance. This, in turn, contributes to global efforts in mitigating climate change, an imperative in the rapidly evolving digital economic landscape.","[He, Qiao] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenjuan; Zhang, Panpan] Tomsk State Univ, Inst Econ & Management, Tomsk, Russia; [Guo, Cheng] Univ Colorado, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Xi'an University of Technology; Tomsk State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Zhang, PP (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Inst Econ & Management, Tomsk, Russia.",heqiao202212@163.com; lwjhappy8868618@163.com; 15042706112@126.com; Cheng.Guo@Colorado.edu,,,Social Science Foundation Project of Shaanxi Province [2023D017]; Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Natural Science Project [22JK0481]; Xi'an Social Science Foundation Project [23JX96],Social Science Foundation Project of Shaanxi Province; Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Natural Science Project; Xi'an Social Science Foundation Project,This research was supported by the following projects: [1] Social Science Foundation Project of Shaanxi Province Evaluation and promotion strategy of 'four chains' integrated development level of high-end equipment manusfactures in Shaanxi Province (2023D017) .

A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply to be eligible for fiscal support such as tax exemptions. Flexibility in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 - a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains input output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustain ability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong 'sustainability performance' and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel 'sustainability'.

This article assesses the contribution of such food networks to territorial development in the provinces of Salamanca and Zamora (Spain), severely constrained by depopulation and the dispersion of production and consumption centres. After compiling an inventory of active networks, a sample of initiatives across all the stages in the value chain was interviewed in depth. The information recorded sheds light onto three key topics. First, the values and objectives aimed at by their stakeholders. Second, their embeddedness in this weak territory, key to assessing their contribution to economic, social, environmental and governance development. Third, the limitations raised by the territorial context and the institutional and governance framework to the strengthening of these initiatives. It is concluded that the social capital underlying these food networks is the fundamental resource that sustains their ability to leverage the natural capital of the territory, despite the limited economic capacities of these networks and the unequal support they receive from public administrations.","[Hernandez, Jose Luis Sanchez; Gomez, Teresa Sierra] Univ Salamanca, Dept Geog, Salamanca, Spain; [Gutierrez, Lourdes Moro] Univ Salamanca, Dept Psicol Social & Antropol, Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca; University of Salamanca,"Hernández, JLS (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Geog, Salamanca, Spain.",jlsh@usal.es; moro@usal.es; teresgz@usal.es,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,1,,,,0212-9426,2605-3322,,,,,2025,,103,,,,,,,3586,10.21138/bage.3586,http://dx.doi.org/10.21138/bage.3586,,,,Geography,,Geography,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Second, firms have increasingly aligned themselves with, as opposed to fighting off, environmental, fair trade, and other NGOs. Third, firms have embraced supply chain management as a strategy for increasing profits and market share. Together, these trends are part and parcel of the neoliberal blurring of the older liberal distinction between state and civil society. In this paper I ask what the implications of these changes are from the vantage point of the three major approaches to ethics: consequentialism, virtue theory, and rights theory. What are the consequences of these changes for food safety, for suppliers, for consumers? What virtues (e.g., trust, fairness) are these changes likely to embrace and what vices may accompany them?

The analysis focuses on food narratives, responsible consumption, battles for the food emancipation of subaltern and low-income subjects, and attention to the quality, fairness, and traceability of food products as an expression of individual agency, as well as an expression of public engagement with food democracy/citizenship conflicts and frictions. Preliminarily, the paper moves from a discussion of collective agency on food strategies and representations to a critical approach to food democracy and sustainable society. This public arena for food debates is then confronted with personal behaviors embodying food citizenship in the contemporary scenario of socio-economic and environmental transition. The paper addresses the following sustainable development goals: responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), ending hunger, food security, improved nutrition, sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and health and well-being (SDG 3). Starting from the democratic/neoliberal dichotomy, the paper will consider food governmentality as a positive alternative to food emancipation and democracy, as well as a personal need and a neo-communitarian political approach opposed to agroindustry and food consumerism and dispossession. Three case studies, all situated in the central-southern Italian region of Molise, will discuss different models of food citizenship and governmentality, as well as the relationship between individual responsibility and desires and collective commitment and perspectives. These issues will be framed within a rural economy paradigm and articulated through an ethnographic methodology: local data collection, emic/ethic representations, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. This long-term observation has been realized in the framework of several projects that were coordinated and developed by the authors, who worked for several years in the regional territory, especially on projects focusing on local/regional/national policies of sustainable rural development and bio-cultural heritage conservation and valorization according to the mission of the research center, which they founded and coordinated over the last seven years. The case studies and discussion allow for some final consideration of the impact of individual and community agencies on the achievement of SDGs, the presence of not exclusively consumeristic and hedonistic behaviors, and the growing attention to ecological concerns being paid food producers and distributors, as well as new forms of rural-urban circularity and entanglements aiming toward greater awareness and democratization of food access, security, and sustainable agriculture.","[Bindi, Letizia] Univ Molise, Ctr Res BIOCULT, Dept Social Human & Learning Sci, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy; [Belliggiano, Angelo] Univ Molise, Ctr Res BIOCULT, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy",University of Molise; University of Molise,"Bindi, L (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Ctr Res BIOCULT, Dept Social Human & Learning Sci, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy.",letizia.bindi@unimol.it,,,,,,,128,6,6,3,15,,,,,2071-1050,,,,APR,2023,15,8,,,,,,,6881,10.3390/su15086881,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15086881,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

At present, REDD+ is underfunded, due in part to a lack of private funding caused by the absence of a compliance market for REDD+ credits. One of the obstacles in creating a compliance market is a concern that private funders will capture profits for themselves at the expense of local welfare. To date, however, little research has been done to assess this risk. This study helps to fill this gap by investigating the motives of current and potential future private REDD+ funders. Interview results indicate that most current funders have sought positive local social impacts, both to mitigate the risk of deforestation and to demonstrate social benefits for marketing purposes. The risk mitigation motive could exist in a compliance market, depending on how contractual arrangements distribute risk along the supply chain. However, respondents suggested that the social marketing motive would be diminished in a compliance market, because compliance buyers would prioritize credit price and volume over reputational benefits. There is a need for further research that examines whether these reported motives correlate with actual firm behaviour and how this might inform future REDD+ governance.","[Barron, D.

This article addresses political CSR of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs represent a major share of economic value creation worldwide and are increasingly exposed to regulatory gaps. Although SMEs differ substantially from MNCs in terms of organizational characteristics, behavioral guiding principles, and financial and human resources, they should still tackle such regulatory gaps by accepting a political role.

Amidst the pivotal trend of moderately scaled agricultural operations, rural e-commerce holds promise as a catalyst and driving force for enhancing long-term environmental governance of transferred lands. The effectiveness and mechanisms of this potential, however, remain to be empirically examined. This study gathers panel data on environmental positive and negative externalities from six provinces in China, spanning the period from 2013 to 2022, encompassing 6372 farmers. A quasi-natural experiment of farmers' e-commerce participation is designed using difference-in-differences methodology (DID), propensity score matching (PSM), and moderating models. The primary findings are as follows: E-commerce participation increases farmers' positive environmental inputs on transferred lands, such as water-saving irrigation, adoption of social services, and preservation of traditional varieties. Simultaneously, it decreases negative environmental inputs, such as the consumption of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films. The environmental sustainability effects of e-commerce vary across the eastern, central, and western regions of China. E-commerce has a more pronounced impact on agricultural social services and chemical pollutants in the eastern and central regions, while its influence is more significant on water-saving irrigation and variety preservation in the western region. Land transfer forms and supply order contracts do not directly promote farmers' environmentally friendly cultivation practices. Instead, they catalyze the environmental effects of e-commerce through a significant positive interaction term. These conclusions hold after matching for e-commerce participation propensity, while passing sensitivity tests, parallel trend tests, and placebo tests. Consequently, rural e-commerce, without compromising farmers' income, enhances the proactiveness of farmers in environmental conservation, transforms agricultural management practices, and effectively reduces rural non-point source pollution. Policy recommendations include reducing institutional barriers to rural e-commerce participation at the national level, encouraging the establishment of region-specific agricultural environmental sustainability goals, and leveraging the rural e-commerce industry chain to establish a nationwide environmental credit database and incentive mechanism.","[Cheng, Xinwei; Wang, Zimin] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Lv, Haozhe] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Cheng, XW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",chengxw@njupt.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China,National Social Science Fund of China,No Statement Available,,55,0,0,7,29,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,2024 MAR 12,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11356-024-32699-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-024-32699-y,,MAR 2024,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assess information flows around Best Management Practices (BMPs) undertaken by dairy farmers in central Pennsylvania, a subregion of the watershed. We apply a mixed-method approach, combining Social Network Analysis, the analysis of BMP-messaging (i.e. information source, flow, and their influences), and qualitative content analysis of stakeholders' interviews. Key strategic actors were identified through network centrality measures such as degree of node, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient. The perceived influence/credibility (by farmers) of BMP-messages and their source, allowed for the identification of strategic entry points for BMP-messages diffusion. Finally, the inductive coding process of stakeholders' interviews revealed major hindrances and opportunities for BMPs adoption. We demonstrate how improved targeting of policy interventions for BMPs uptake may be achieved, by better distributing entry-points across stakeholders. Our results reveal governance gaps and opportunities, on which we draw to provide insights for better tailored policy interventions. We propose strategies to optimize the coverage of policy mixes and the dissemination of BMP-messages by building on network diversity and actors' complementarities, and by targeting intervention towards specific BMPs and actors. We suggest that (i) conservation incentives could target supply chain actors as conservation intermediaries; (ii) compliance-control of manure management planning could be conducted by accredited private certifiers; (iii) policy should focus on incentivizing inter-farmers interaction (e.g. farmers' mobility, training, knowledge-exchange, and engagement in multi-stakeholders collaboration) via financial or non-pecuniary compensation; (iv) collective incentives could help better coordinate conservation efforts at the landscape or (sub-)watershed scale; (v) all relevant stakeholders (including farmers) should be concerted and included in the discussion, proposition, co-design and decision process of policy, in order to take their respective interests and responsibilities into account.","[Dingkuhn, Elsa L.; Schulte, Rogier P.

This review paper examines the classification and applications of dyes, highlighting the challenges posed by synthetic dyes and the growing interest in natural dyes. The impact of textile dyes on human health, ecosystems, water, soil, and air emissions is explored. The focus then shifts to sustainable dyeing practices in the denim industry, which can significantly reduce its environmental footprint and enhance product sustainability. The adoption of sustainable dyes aligns with circular economy principles, leading to energy and water savings. Collaboration, consumer awareness, and the integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are essential for driving sustainable dye adoption and promoting circular economy principles. The role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in sustainable denim dyeing is emphasized, encompassing environmental, social, and governance considerations throughout the supply chain. The need to address greenwashing and validate sustainability claims is discussed, highlighting the importance of certifications and transparency. Chemical dyes are recognized as key contributors to achieving sustainability targets in the denim industry, aligning with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and reducing carbon emissions. The review concludes by stressing the importance of sustainable dyeing practices, considering water and energy usage, waste generation, and emissions, to minimize the denim industry's environmental impact and achieve sustainability objectives.","[Yousaf, M.

Previous studies focused more on emission inventories and abatement technologies, however, final demand also plays a significant role in driving China's industrial process-related GHG emissions. Based on the environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis, this study explores detailed industrial process-related GHG emissions inventory and investigates critical supply chain paths of 17 products and 16 types of GHG emissions. The results show that industrial process-related GHG emissions reached 1887.1 Mt CO2-eq in 2018, of which more than three-fifths was induced by fixed capital formation. The entirety of the Construction sector amounted to 54.6% of the total embodied industrial process-related GHG emissions. After examining the embodied industrial processrelated GHG emissions paths, critical economic sectors such as Construction, Nonmetallic Mineral, Chemical, and the paths of Nonmetallic Mineral -* Construction -* Fixed capital formation and Nonmetallic Mineral -* Nonmetallic Mineral -* Construction -* Fixed capital formation were identified as the main contributor. In considering of the enormous challenges during mitigating GHG emissions from process-related industries, it is essential to identify and optimize critical supply chains, which provides new insights into China's industrial process transition towards a low-carbon economy.","[Peng, Yunan] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yunan] Xiangjiang Lab, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo; Yan, Kejia] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Han, Mengyao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Han, Mengyao] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Environm Energy & Nat Resource Governance C EE, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England","China University of Mining & Technology; Xiamen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Cambridge","Zhang, B (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Han, MY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangbo@xmu.edu.cn; hanmy@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"Major Program of Xiangjiang Laboratory [22XJ01008]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72394405, 72374175]; National Key Research and Development Program [2022YFE0127500]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720231063]; National Social Science Fund of China [22CJY020]",Major Program of Xiangjiang Laboratory; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Social Science Fund of China,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Major Program of Xiangjiang Laboratory (Grant No. 22XJ01008), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72394405 and 72374175), the National Key Research and Development Program (No. 2022YFE0127500), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 20720231063), and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grand no. 22CJY020) .",,41,0,0,28,28,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,NOV 15,2024,480,,,,,,,,144060,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144060,,OCT 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this reason, it is essential to be informed about its performance, problems and innovations. This paper presents the progress done in the transition towards sustainable production and consumption patterns. A literature review of the life cycle stages of textile products was carried out to identify initiatives and actions improving the performance. The findings show that transparency and traceability along the supply chain have been a fundamental piece in the transition. Besides, the creation of multi-stakeholders' clusters, seeking to improve social and environmental issues has been one of the most successful paths in this transition. However, a lack of training and skills along the life cycle stages and disconnection between products' design and strategies of recycling was found. For this reason, it is recommendable to generate an in-depth diagnosis of the textile industry at a global and regional level. As well, it is necessary to generate strategies and tools that facilitate this transition, mainly supporting SMEs (small- and medium-sized companies).","[Lujan-Ornelas, Cristina; Franco-Garcia, Maria-Laura; Heldeweg, Michiel] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Patricia Guereca, Leonor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Circuito Escolar S-N,Ciudad Univ, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, Mexico",University of Twente; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Luján-Ornelas, C (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.",c.c.lujanornelas@utwente.nl; LGuerecaH@iingen.unam.mx; m.l.francogarcia@utwente.nl; m.a.heldeweg@utwente.nl,,,Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT); University of Twente,Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); University of Twente,This research is funded by the Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) and the University of Twente.,,97,26,29,14,77,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2020,12,23,,,,,,,10193,10.3390/su122310193,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122310193,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Often, there is a spatial disconnect between consumers and the natural systems where the commodities are produced. Traded agricultural products are therefore dependent on nature and NCP in their region of origin. The dependencies of agricultural products on NCP are, however, insufficiently recognised by consumers and are rarely considered in global environmental governance and trade policies along value chains. Here, we synthesise studies highlighting dependencies of agricultural products on NCP in their origin locations to identify opportunities and challenges in quantifying their contribution in sustaining trade flows. We suggest three methodological steps for quantifying NCP dependencies in international agricultural trade: spatial mapping of NCP supply and demand, linking NCP to agricultural trade flows, and tracing trade flows. Each methodological step requires further development and harmonisation to enable a complete accounting of how international agricultural trade depends on NCP. Given the lack of knowledge and data on how NCP support agricultural trade, social and environmental trade-offs of natural resource management are currently hard to quantify. Quantifying the role of NCP dependencies of traded agricultural products can support their sustainable management, contribute to supply chain accountability and serve as input to sustainable natural resource governance and foster responsibility and equity in supply chains.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

While previous research has attempted to assess progress against such initiatives, little is known about how the characteristics of sourcing patterns may influence the adoption and potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments. Supply chain stickiness - here defined as the geographic persistence in trade relationships between traders and sourcing regions over time - may reflect lock-in effects and the level of trust between the parties involved. Here, we use a metric of supply chain stickiness, calculated from temporal network analyses on the Brazilian soy export supply chain, as a proxy for these underlying dynamics to explore their effect on the adoption and effectiveness of zero deforestation commitments (ZDCs). Using data for 2004-2017, we find that although stickier traders are more likely to adopt ZDCs, they also appear to have less effective ZDCs than other traders (as indicated by the level of soy and territorial deforestation in their sourcing regions). This finding suggests that additional strategies are needed to increase the effectiveness of ZDCs.","[Leijten, Floris; Sim, Sarah] Unilever R&D, Safety & Environm Assurance Ctr, Colworth Sci Pk, Sharnbrook, Beds, England; [dos Reis, Tiago N.

First, KSR can be seen as a response to vertical deconstruction, the erosion of intra-firm and social orders that historically generated and transmitted non-commercial social norms. Second, as such, KSR terms will be legally un(der)-enforceable: Like better-studied relational contracts, KSR will blend enforceable and unenforceable terms to achieve governance, risk-sharing, and educative goals. Third, although KSR may be more effective than more popular mechanisms, in particular corporate social responsibility, KSR is not a panacea, and presents risks of cooptation and fragmentation often associated with soft-law regimes.","[Lipson, Jonathan C.] Temple Univ, Beasley Sch Law, Law, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Lipson, JC (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Beasley Sch Law, Law, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",,,,,,,,194,6,6,0,3,,,,0043-650X,1943-1120,,,,,2019,,5,,,,,1109,1160,,,,,,,Law,,Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - Correlation, regression and cluster analyses of data gathered in 2005 in the Dutch food and drink (F&D) industry were carried out. Findings - The deployment of managerial capabilities that support ecological modernization (such as supply chain cooperation and network information exchange, or product-redesign) in the Dutch F&D industry is low. The results show that different company profiles are connected with specific drivers and barriers for environmental pro-activeness. Prospector companies (a minority) are more pro-active with respect to environmental capability building than defenders. Research limitations/implications - Comparative longitudinal studies of environmental management drivers in subsectors could improve the understanding of the factors that stimulate environmental performance. Practical implications - Optimism that industry will enhance EM-performance through radical market-induced innovation is misplaced. Instead, a contingency approach is in place. Public environmental policy with respect to the F&D industry should be adjusted to discernable managerial patterns and categories of companies. Voluntary cooperation, self-governance, and market-induced environmental innovation are only effective with respect to a minority of the companies. Originality/value - The research opposes the existing foundation of public environmental policy on generic attributes assigned to the whole F&D-industry and, consequently, of generic policies to improve environmental management performance. A differentiation of public policy should be based on the understanding of the drivers of managerial behavior.","[Bremmers, Harry] Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Business Adm Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Haverkamp, Derk-Jan; Omta, Onno] Environ Netherlands, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Bremmers, H (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Business Adm Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",harry.bremmers@wur.nl,,,,,,,68,11,13,1,19,,,,0007-070X,1758-4108,,,,,2010,112,10-11,,,,,1237,1251,,10.1108/00070701011088223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00070701011088223,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the emergence of multiple perspectives has challenged its implementation. As the industry that is the biggest contributor to the negative impacts on the environment, the construction industry stakeholders are paving the way for more sustainable as well as circular and regenerative construction by considering all actors in the system. Yet, the construction industry has a complex supply chain that requires clear strategies and stakeholder engagement across materials, buildings, and cities for efficient flows in the supply chain. Nonetheless, there is a need for improvement in the engagement of construction stakeholders for circular transformation. Therefore, this study aims to develop a multi-stakeholder engagement framework through circular transformation to guide the decision-makers for circular city governance. It has identified critical success factors by considering the construction stakeholders. The framework includes strategies at the micro (material), meso (building), and macro (city) scales to strengthen the material-building-city synergy. It's a significant step toward advancing circular city governance by bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation and establishing a robust engagement for material-building-city synergy. The study employs a systematic literature review to extract strategies and natural language processing to analyze the strategies by topic modeling and defines critical success factors for multi-stakeholder engagement at multiscale. The outcome introduces the REVERT framework, bridging resource, envisagement, validation, entity, regulation, and technology, to facilitate a seamless transition by material-building-city synergy advancing circular city governance.","[Bostanc, Hafize Busra; Tanyer, Ali Murat] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Architecture, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkiye; [Tanyer, Ali Murat] Res Ctr Built Environm MATPUM, Ankara, Turkiye; [Bostanc, Hafize Busra; Habert, Guillaume] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Sustainable Construct, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Construct & Infrastruct Management, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bostanc, Hafize Busra] Hitit Univ, Dept Architecture, TR-19030 Corum, Turkiye",Middle East Technical University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Hitit University,"Bostanc, HB (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Architecture, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Cankaya, Ankara, Turkiye.",busra.bostanci@metu.edu.tr; tanyer@metu.edu.tr; habert@ibi.baug.ethz.ch,,,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Tuerkiye; Social ComQuant Twinning Action - Koc University,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Tuerkiye; Social ComQuant Twinning Action - Koc University(Koc University),"This work was partially supported by doctoral research fellowship grant from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Tuerkiye (TUEBITAK) .

One of the most relevant elements therein corresponds to the way in which these assets participate in value chains, whether short or long, which has important implications for governance, benefit distribution, geographic organization of value accumulation processes, among others. With that in mind, we identify the two most relevant Mexican GIs-namely Designation of Origin Tequila (DOT) and Designation of Origin Mezcal (DOM)-to analyze how their value chains have been constructed and their impact on territorial development. We conclude that GIs tend to adopt large value chains to satisfy long-distance demand, but they can have negative territorial effects if institutions are not strong enough to appropriately incorporate territorial stakeholders' demands.","[Perez-Akaki, Pablo] Univ Anahuac Mexico, Fac Responsabilidad Social, Huixquilucan 52786, Mexico; [Viridiana Vega-Vera, Nadia; Paola Enriquez-Caballero, Yuritzi] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Super Studies Acatlan, Naucalpan De Juarez 53150, Mexico; [Velazquez-Salazar, Marisol] Univ Panamer, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Augusto Rodin 498, Ciudad De Mexico 03920, Mexico",Universidad Anahuac; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Pérez-Akaki, P (corresponding author), Univ Anahuac Mexico, Fac Responsabilidad Social, Huixquilucan 52786, Mexico.;Velázquez-Salazar, M (corresponding author), Univ Panamer, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Augusto Rodin 498, Ciudad De Mexico 03920, Mexico.",pablo.pereza@anahuac.mx; nadiavvv@hotmail.com; pafec_2633@hotmail.com; mvelazquez@up.edu.mx,,,,,,,76,9,10,1,15,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAY,2021,13,10,,,,,,,5496,10.3390/su13105496,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105496,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a pivotal criterion for measuring green development, green total factor productivity (GTFP) refers to maximizing output while minimizing the environmental pollution for the required input production factors. Existing research neglects the impact of ESG ratings on GTFP that indicates the balance between economic growth and ecological protection. This study examines the impact of ESG ratings and mechanisms on GTFP using a sample of Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms between 2010 and 2021. The findings indicate that ESG ratings promote corporate GTFP, a result which remains robust after a series of robustness tests. The mechanism analysis reveals that ESG ratings improve corporate GTFP by alleviating financial constraints, mitigating managerial myopia, and enhancing supply chain efficiency. A moderating analysis verified that managerial power weakens the positive impact of ESG ratings on corporate GTFP. The positive effect of ESG ratings on GTFP is more pronounced among non-state-owned firms and firms in non-heavily polluting and highly competitive industries. This study confirms that ESG ratings can achieve the benefits of productivity growth, energy conservation, and pollution reduction at the micro-enterprise level, offering a policy foundation for promoting ESG disclosure and achieving green development.","[Wu, Si; Fan, Minhao; Liu, Zaiqi; Xiang, Yuchen] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Wu, Lei] Wuhan Coll, Sch Law, Wuhan 430212, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan College,"Wu, S; Liu, ZQ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",2021101050008@whu.edu.cn; 2022201050134@whu.edu.cn; 21206010432@mail.whxy.edu.cn; 00006793@whu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China; [20ZD229],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences);,This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (20&ZD229).,,70,2,2,20,20,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2024,16,23,,,,,,,10653,10.3390/su162310653,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162310653,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While firms may be able to accumulate the environmental expertise needed to achieve this goal internally, doing so may require significant time and resource commitments. Alternatively, buyer firms can leverage their suppliers' existing environmental expertise and gain access to such expertise when they purchase products and services from these suppliers. The purpose of this study was to develop and test theory regarding under what conditions suppliers' environmental expertise influences a buying firms' procurement spend with these suppliers. We ground our study in transaction cost economics and agency theories and empirically test our hypotheses using a unique buyer-supplier dyadic data set. We find that buyer firms are willing to increase their overall business spend with suppliers that have strong environmental expertise, particularly when the buyer firms are more profitable and have higher levels of absorptive capacity. However, we find the opposite effect when the buyer firm's executive compensation is linked to the firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Likewise, we also find that the buyer firm's environmental concern ratings negatively moderate the relationship between the supplier's environmental expertise and the buyer's procurement spend with the supplier.","[Mukandwal, Prabhjot S.] Michigan Technol Univ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Cantor, David E.] Iowa State Univ, Debbie & Jerry Ivy Coll Business, Supply Chain Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Cantor, David E.] Iowa State Univ, Debbie & Jerry Ivy Coll Business, Logist & Supply Chain Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Grimm, Curtis M.] Univ Maryland Coll Pk, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Econ & Strategy, College Pk, MD USA; [Elking, Isaac] Univ Houston Downtown, Marilyn Davies Coll Business, Supply Chain Management, Houston, TX USA; [Hofer, Christian] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Michigan Technological University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Houston System; University of Houston Downtown; University of Houston; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Cantor, DE (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Debbie & Jerry Ivy Coll Business, Dept Supply Chain Management, 2340 Gerdin Business Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dcantor@iastate.edu,,,,,,,145,24,26,10,81,,,,0735-3766,2158-1592,,,,JUN,2020,41,2,,,,,129,148,,10.1111/jbl.12248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbl.12248,,JUN 2020,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relying on social systems engineering principles, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework considering four port governance models and five major GPM practice indicators. We validate the MCDM framework using survey data collected from top management executives of three ports in the Indian Ocean Rim - Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. We compare the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method with more recently developed Best-Worst Method (BWM) in analysis of the MCDM problem of finding the right port governance model for GPM. We collect data using the ANP and BWM survey in January 2019 and August 2019, respectively, from the same respondents. While participating in the study in January 2019, the respondents did not know that they would respond to the same MCDM problem using a different model, which corresponds to a repeated measures experimental design. In both analyses, we find that increasing privatization in port governance would enhance the implementation of GPM practices. Our study furthermore suggests that BWM is a reliable MCDM method with greater applicability than ANP, as it requires significantly lower number of judgement comparisons. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, social sustainability issues and pandemic problems from COVID-19 have affected corporations and interrupted plans for sustainable development. To date, corporate sustainability frameworks have taken a relatively narrow view of this paradigm. This study highlights serious challenges to corporate sustainability while providing a framework in an attempt to enable more sustainable business practices. To fill the gap in the literature, we have developed a framework to organize and prioritize important sustainability indicators. The first phase of the study involves the classification of 45 sub-criteria of corporate sustainability under nine main categories by using a literature review and novel Fuzzy Delphi method. The resulting categories are Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption along with Energy Saving, and includes Pandemic COVID-19 as a new aspect of social sustainability. Next, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to help determine the weights and prioritizing the criteria and sub-criteria. The results revealed that the Pandemic, along with the Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, ranked higher among the main criteria category. Whereas, emergency response planning, social distances, modification of working hours, and just-in-time delivery are the most influencing sub-attributes among the 45 sub-barriers of different categories. Contributions of this study include new insights regarding corporate sustainability criteria and subcriteria, application of novel methods, and integrated framework for dimensions of corporate sustainability. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential category and social sustainability attribute of corporate sustainable business practices. Outcomes of this study can help assist scholars, corporations, and decision-makers in understanding sustainable development initiatives while simultaneously improving social sustainability practices.","[Ikram, Muhammad; Zhang, Qingyu] Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Business Analyt & Supply Chain Managemen, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Sroufe, Robert] Duquesne Univ, Donahue Grad Sch Business, 820 Rockwell Hall,600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Ferasso, Marcos] Community Univ Chapeco Region, Appl Social Sci Dept, BR-89809900 Chapeco, SC, Brazil",Shenzhen University; Duquesne University,"Zhang, QY (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Business Analyt & Supply Chain Managemen, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.;Sroufe, R (corresponding author), Duquesne Univ, Donahue Grad Sch Business, 820 Rockwell Hall,600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",mikram@szu.edu.cn; q.yu.zhang@gmail.com; sroufer@duq.edu; admmarcosferasso@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71572115]; Major Program of Social Science Foundation of Guangdong [2016WZDXM005]; 2020 Guangdong 13th-Five-Year-Plan Philosophical and Social Science Fund [GD20CGL28]; Natural Science Foundation of SZU [836],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Program of Social Science Foundation of Guangdong; 2020 Guangdong 13th-Five-Year-Plan Philosophical and Social Science Fund; Natural Science Foundation of SZU,"This research was funded by, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71572115; Major Program of Social Science Foundation of Guangdong, Grant/Award Number: 2016WZDXM005; 2020 Guangdong 13th-Five-Year-Plan Philosophical and Social Science Fund (#GD20CGL28); and Natural Science Foundation of SZU, Grant/Award Number: 836.",,108,77,80,4,88,,,,,2071-1050,,,,OCT,2020,12,20,,,,,,,8747,10.3390/su12208747,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208747,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Kraljic proposed that supply management professionals needed to engage in a new approach, embracing globalization, technology and risk. This article marked a critical juncture for supply chain management. Almost three decades later, it is evident that the purchasing portfolio concept has been widely adopted as an effective practitioner tool and a well-accepted tenet in the supply chain management literature. However, a recently completed study yielded interesting evidence of a potential shift in supply chain management, specifically, in sustainable sourcing. We recently observed that a number of leaders in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) were not organizing purchasing portfolios in the manner suggested by Kraljic. We found organizations buying what would traditionally be leveraged commodities in a manner more appropriate for strategic suppliers. This unexpected observation suggests that the supply chain field may face another critical juncture, this time related to SSCM. This manuscript describes the observed phenomena and then, using an inductive approach, enhances the existing theory to explain what was observed. The end result is a modified sustainable purchasing portfolio model that should provide a strategic tool to help both academics and practitioners adapt to the new realities of SSCM.","[Pagell, Mark] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Wu, Zhaohui] Oregon State Univ, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Wasserman, Michael E.] Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Potsdam, NY USA",York University - Canada; Oregon State University; Clarkson University,"Pagell, M (corresponding author), York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",,,,,,,,49,267,299,3,176,,,,1523-2409,1745-493X,,,,,2010,46,1,,,,,57,73,,10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03186.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03186.x,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is necessary to evaluate the security of China's indium industrial chain and determine the reasons that affect security. The past substance flow analysis (SFA) of indium and mineral industrial chain security evaluation has problems such as a lack of timeliness, a single dimension mainly focusing on the upstream, and simple evaluation methods. In this paper, based on the SFA, an integrated evaluation system for the whole life cycle is constructed from 2000 to 2022 according to mineral industrial chain security characteristics. The results show that since introducing liquid crystal in 2003, China's indium industrial chain security level has been low despite a slight increase. Although China has gradually broken through the production technology of highpurity indium and indium tin oxide (ITO) targets, the large consumption and export of refined indium has reduced China's indium metal stock to 2214 t, while the resource reserves advantage is also diminishing. Mass consumption has also led China to import more ores, while China still imports high-end products from other countries with high import source concentrations. The pollutants emitted by the large production and the declining environmental governance level pose a significant environmental threat.

The 3Rs for a sustainable use of natural resources in Ulaanbaatar (3R4UB) project aims at transferring a sustainable approach to urban solid waste management, especially focusing on providing effective opportunities for developing circular supply chains locally. In this framework, an integrated approach has been developed in order to adapt the communication/exploitation plan of sustainable waste management within a SWITCH-Asia Country (EU Program) by combining engagement tools and participatory processes for the collaborative design of a waste management masterplan. This paper explores the spatialization of resources/waste flows in the formal and informal settlements, while also considering cultural traditions, social structures, and community habits, in terms of a purposely designed combination of spatial planning, governance modeling, and capacity building activities. Starting from a preliminary communication plan, this paper sets the frame for discussing the role of community engagement tools and protocols in producing an effective and generalizable collaborative waste management masterplan.","[De Vita, Gabriella Esposito] Inst Res Innovat & Serv Dev IRISS, Natl Res Council CNR, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Visconti, Cristina; Rigillo, Marina] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Architecture, I-80134 Naples, Italy; [Ganbat, Gantuya] German Mongolian Inst Resources & Technol GMIT, Ulaanbaatar 12790, Mongolia",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca su Innovazione e Servizi per lo Sviluppo (IRISS-CNR); University of Naples Federico II,"Visconti, C (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Architecture, I-80134 Naples, Italy.",g.esposito@iriss.cnr.it; cristina.visconti@unina.it; gantuya@gmit.edu.mn; marina.rigillo@unina.it,,,"The authors would like to thank the 3R4UB project manager Fabrizio Canonico (CNR IRISS), the communication manager Igor Scognamiglio, and the Mongolian liaison officers Ing Batzul Khayankhyarvaa and Ing Lucio Trifiletti for their administrative and technic; Italian Ambassy in Mongolia; Mongolian Ambassy in Italy; Municipality of Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia; Mongolian Government Agency Fresh Water Resources and Nature Conservation Centre (FWRNCC)","The authors would like to thank the 3R4UB project manager Fabrizio Canonico (CNR IRISS), the communication manager Igor Scognamiglio, and the Mongolian liaison officers Ing Batzul Khayankhyarvaa and Ing Lucio Trifiletti for their administrative and technic; Italian Ambassy in Mongolia; Mongolian Ambassy in Italy; Municipality of Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia; Mongolian Government Agency Fresh Water Resources and Nature Conservation Centre (FWRNCC)","The authors would like to thank the 3R4UB project manager Fabrizio Canonico (CNR IRISS), the communication manager Igor Scognamiglio, and the Mongolian liaison officers Ing Batzul Khayankhyarvaa and Ing Lucio Trifiletti for their administrative and technical support.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, institutional theory, and the specific context of emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs), we propose that supplier ESG performance positively influences the degree of internationalization of focal firms from emerging economies. Specifically, ESG voids in the home country incentivize firms to leverage supplier ESG strengths to overcome legitimacy challenges and then enhance their internationalization. We conceptualize this motivation as the gain of supply chain-specific advantages (SCSAs). Furthermore, supplier ESG performance generates productivity spillovers that improve focal firm productivity, formulating firm-specific advantages (FSAs) that further support internationalization. We also argue that the impact of SCSAs is more pronounced for state-owned firms and those investing in host countries with stronger institutional development. Using data from 401 Chinese MNEs and their supplier-customer linkages, we empirically validate our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the strategic importance of supply chain ESG management for advancing internationalization and provide managerial insights for EMNEs, which aim to mitigate home-country ESG voids and enhance their global competitiveness.","[Yu, Pei; Chen, Yilan; Zhao, Yumiao] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Chen, YL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",cherry_chen@whut.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [19BJY107]; National Social Science Fund of China,National Social Science Fund of China; National Social Science Fund of China,We would like to express our gratitude to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.

The study examines how corporate ESG performance influences green technology innovation (GTI) using data from 2011 to 2020 Chinese A-share listed industrial corporations. Improving corporate ESG performance significantly promotes GTI; these findings remain stable after the treatment of endogenous problems and various robust checks. Corporate life cycle stage, industry features, and patent types have different impacts on the benchmark results. Three channels, including reducing external debt financing costs, mitigating managerial myopia, and optimizing supply chain financing, are the main mechanisms. The moderating effect shows that the external attention augments the positive effect of enterprise ESG performance on GTI, while the top 10 shareholder ownership ratio diminishes the influence. Further studies reveal that corporate ESG performance negatively affects the quality of GTI, while it continuously promotes corporate productivity and operating performance. Better ESG performance helps generate a greater knowledge spillover effect among firms. We add to the existing research on linking enterprise ESG performance and GTI, and additionally give information for businesses in developing countries on how to approach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","[Gao, Xiang; He, Xixi; Wu, Dongmei; Zhang, Jie] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Business, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of International Business & Economics; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Sun, CW (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Sun, CW (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",cw_sun@foxmail.com,,,"National Social Science Fund of China [23BJL059, 22 ZD160]; Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China [21 ZD109]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72074186, 71673230]; Basic Scientific Center Project of National Science Foundation of China [71988101]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities concerned Chinese modernization [20720231061]",National Social Science Fund of China; Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Center Project of National Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities concerned Chinese modernization,"This project is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (No.23BJL059, 22 & ZD160) , the Major Program of the National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China (No.21 & ZD109) , National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.72074186, 71673230) , Basic Scientific Center Project of National Science Foundation of China (No.71988101) , the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities concerned Chinese modernization (No.20720231061) .",,94,5,5,59,59,,,,0140-9883,1873-6181,,,,FEB,2025,142,,,,,,,,108197,10.1016/j.eneco.2025.108197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2025.108197,,JAN 2025,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that Ukraine's agency is developed in the context of the battlefield, and therefore becomes a heavy loaded security concept with a strong normative background.

Voluntary certification schemes, or eco-labels, have emerged as the primary mechanism to improve production practices in complex commodity supply chains. However promising, these programs are difficult to assess in practice, and evidence of their effectiveness is mixed. In the oil palm sector, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has become the standard for sustainable production but there has been no evaluation of whether certification actually improves social and environmental practices on farms. To our knowledge, this study provides the first farm-level assessment of certification programs in the oil palm sector by focusing on RSPO and Organic (IFOAM) certified smallholders in Magdalena, Colombia. We conducted field surveys to evaluate management practices using a case-control pair-wise matching approach and non-parametric tests to assess outcome variables between certified and non-certified groups. We found evidence for better environmental practices among certified producers including the substitution of synthetic fertilizers with organics, less agrochemical use, and larger areas of farms being set-aside for conservation. Socio-economic outcomes were mixed, with certified producers paying higher wages, but employing fewer workers due to lower yields. Price premiums were an important motivation for smallholders to both join and remain in certification schemes. In the degraded oil palm landscapes of Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America, certification standards could be improved by including provisions for increased habitat restoration on plantations and smallholder plots. We find that certification is making progress but is not a panacea for transforming the industry. Going forward, new strategies should be sought in tandem with certification to overcome smallholder informality, enhance inclusion, and capture more value in sustainable supply chains.

The impacts of mineral extraction are usually invisible to consumers who are at the relative end of EV-minerals' life cycle, posing a challenge for the governance of minerals. Due to their increasingly important role in motivating corporate response, understanding consumers' perceptions is crucial to inform efforts towards sustainable mineral extraction (SME), which encompasses the actions, policies, and practices to minimize environmental and social impacts of minerals extractions. In this study, we applied the telecoupling framework and combined a survey and Q-method to examine how EV consumers perceive the life-cycle developments of EV, impacts of minerals extraction, and potential governance schemes. Our analysis identified and discussed the nuanced categories of perceptions and their implications. Overall, there is a general lack of awareness of impacts among respondents, but most respondents recognized the complexity in the supply chain of EVs and the role of consumers in influencing its governance. Contradictory opinions are widely found, reflecting the tensions and conflicts between the imperative of energy transitions and the reality of adverse mining impacts. Improved SME governance should consider the differences in consumers' purchase motivations when mobilizing for changes, and not detract from the positive roles of EVs. We also highlight the need for a telecoupling view in mineral governance and suggest a shift in the EV supply chain to include broader sustainable development goals and a global community of consumers, affected communities, and the general public.","[Liu, Wenjuan; Agusdinata, Datu B.; Eakin, Hallie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Wrigley Hall 352,800 Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Romero, Hugo] Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Santiago, Chile",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Universidad de Chile,"Agusdinata, DB (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Wrigley Hall 352,800 Cady Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",bagusdin@asu.edu,,,,,,,88,20,20,2,23,,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,MAR,2022,75,,,,,,,,102523,10.1016/j.resourpol.2021.102523,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2021.102523,,DEC 2021,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This risk can range from minor disruptions to major conflicts that can significantly affect the global economy and may affect countries in various ways, including disruptions to supply chains, demographic shifts, cultural differences, social and climate change, natural disasters, and resource depletion. This study examines the impact of geopolitical risk, political globalization and military expenses on environmental deterioration concerning natural resource abundance in countries from 1985 to 2020. The results based on Pooled Mean Group Autoregressive Distributive Lag (PMG-ARDL) econometric estimation indicate a direct effect of geopolitical risk and military expenses on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) emissions in the long-as well as the short-run, whilst political globalization and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) preserve ecological quality. These findings, confirmed by panel estimations including fully modified ordinary least squares (FM-OLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (D-OLS), indicate that good governance in a country mitigates the geopolitical risk that can protect the environment quality.

Policymakers, management professionals, and scholars of the FWE nexus call for new approaches that address ranges of social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated sectoral planning. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological systems (SES) science offers a balanced approach for improved FWE nexus through consolidating knowledge from a wide range of disciplines and providing the opportunity to adapt to the changing environment. However, although increasingly employed, it has been complicated to empirically monitor and evaluate the dynamic social ecological nexus systems. A framework for translating SES theory into FWE nexus practice is needed. This paper develops an integrated assessment framework of the social-ecological nexus systems governance and presents results from its application to a Dutch smart-eco city. An integrative multi-level analysis scheme is used to analyze intra-and inter-relationships, quantify social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated FWE management, and visualize FWE supply-chain risks posed to cities by the dynamic humans and nature interactions.

These industries are critical for promoting regional sustainable development. Considering the multiple challenges posed by the development of energy-intensive industries in China, such as environmental governance and energy supply issues, this study aims to explore how local governments can use environmental regulation to address these challenges. Using evolutionary game theory, this paper constructs an evolutionary game model between local governments and energy-intensive enterprises in China. The model examines the equilibrium points and their stability in their strategic interactions. MATLAB simulations are employed to illustrate how non-ideal equilibrium states can evolve into ideal equilibrium states. The findings reveal four equilibrium states in the game between local governments and energy-intensive enterprises: undesirable, worst, suboptimal, and ideal. The initial intentions of participants do not affect the equilibrium state of the system. However, selectively adjusting other cost-benefit variables in the model can guide the system from undesirable, worst, or suboptimal equilibrium states toward the ideal equilibrium state. This study not only deepens the understanding of industrial transfer research but also provides novel insights for local governments to leverage environmental regulation in designing policies that promote regional sustainable development.","[Hu, Liming; Wang, Huilin; Cai, Xinyi] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Xiangtan, Peoples R China",Hunan University of Science & Technology,"Wang, HL (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",1150141@hnust.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [24BGL294],National Social Science Fund of China,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant number: 24BGL294).",,52,0,0,3,3,,,,2158-2440,,,,,JAN,2025,15,1,,,,,,,2.15824E+16,10.1177/21582440251328118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440251328118,,,,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The capacity of wild fisheries is limited and therefore aquaculture is fast becoming the most stable source of seafood to meet increasing demand. Subsequently, the perceived environmental risk of fin-fish aquaculture has been the focus of substantial environmental campaigning, media and public scrutiny around the world. This paper places localised tensions regarding the environmental impacts of salmon aquaculture within transnational environmental sustainability debates concerning seafood production and vice-versa, with a focus on the Australia-Asia region. The results contribute to understanding the interpretation and communication of environmental sustainability of seafood through international supply chains and to audiences at different spatial scales. The paper draws particularly on the case of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania, Australia's southern island state. It highlights mechanisms, such as certification, for which information flows transnationally regarding the environmental sustainability of seafood production, the resultant transnational and local public sphere and the implications for local discourse, market access, governance and certification of seafood production.","[Cullen-knox, Coco; Flaming, Aysha; Lester, Libby; Ogier, Emily] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Cullen-knox, Coco; Lester, Libby] Univ Tasmania, Media Sch, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Flaming, Aysha] CSIRO Land & Water, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lester, Libby] Univ Tasmania, Inst Social Change, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Ogier, Emily] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Cullen-knox, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Cullen-knox, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Media Sch, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",cullenc@utas.edu.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [DP150103454]; Centre for Marine Socioecology,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Centre for Marine Socioecology","The authors of this paper would like to acknowledge the support of The Centre for Marine Socioecology and the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

This study employs a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework on quarterly data from Q1-1996 to Q4-2019. The results reveal that positive shocks in human capital (HCI) instigate GI by 1.05%, while negative shock undermines GI by 0.93%. Similarly, positive shocks in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increase GI by 0.63%, while any negative shock undermines GI by 0.01%. On the other hand, positive shock in ICT leads to 0.55% advanced GI; however, this effect turned stronger in negative shocks, which leads to reduced GI by 0.78% in the long-run. These results confirm the asymmetricity because positive and negative shocks in HCI, CO2 emissions, and ICT instigated GI differently. Finally, INST and GDP contribute to enhancing GI by 0.12% and 1.69%, respectively.

Thus, the REG development in any country can be attributed to its crucial drivers as well as crucial barriers. This work aims to identify crucial influence factors of REG development by conducting multi-facet content analysis as well as partial least square-based structural equation modeling analysis on data collected through a questionnaire survey. It has been conducted based on academicians from four Pakistani universities as well as professionals from Islamabad Electric Supply Company. The key outcomes are as follows: First, through multi-facet content analysis, ten crucial influence factors are identified. Among those factors, lack of good governance, renewable energy adaptation, and governmental energy policies are revealed to be the crucial barriers to REG development, whereas endowed resources, power production approach, renewable energy demand, investment environment for renewable energy projects, economic returns of renewable energy projects, environmental effects, and public acceptance are found to be the crucial drivers of REG development. Based on relative significance, the lack of good governance is unveiled to be the most significant factor, while environmental effects is found to be the least significant one. Moreover, among the drivers of REG development, public acceptance is found to be the prime contributor. At the same time, among crucial barriers, lack of good governance has shown the largest contribution to REG development.","[Fatima, Nousheen; Li, Yanbin; Jabeen, Gul; Li, Xiaoyu] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Munir] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Jabeen, Gul] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Res Inst Business Analyt & Supply Chain Managemen, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; Zhejiang University; Shenzhen University,"Li, YB (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.;Ahmad, M (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",liyb@ncepu.edu.cn; munirahmad@zju.edu.cn,,,"Beijing Social Science Foundation Research-based Project; North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","Beijing Social Science Foundation Research-based Project; North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","Beijing Social Science Foundation Research-based Project and North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China.",,94,92,93,3,55,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,OCT,2021,28,37,,,,,51714,51732,,10.1007/s11356-021-14256-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14256-z,,MAY 2021,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - As theory-building research, the paper explores the environmental conditions and managerial processes that promote or hinder supply chain collaboration from a variety of theoretical lenses including contingency theory, the resource-based view of the firm, the relational view of the firm, force field analysis, constituency based theory, social dilemma theory, and resource-advantage theory. Findings - To demonstrate how an integrated theoretical framework can help us understand the dynamics of supply chain collaboration, the paper uses the framework to explicate the evolution and state of collaborative inventory management. Practical implications - The framework can accurately depict and explain highly publicized collaborative failures and successes. It is also possible to draw from the model's core propositions to design prescriptive remedies for the challenges managers encounter as they seek to build collaborative inventory management capabilities. Originality/value - Supply chain collaboration is a complex and dynamic phenomenon; however, existing management theories only describe locally observed phenomenon. As a result, it is a struggle to both explain existing collaborative behavior and provide prescriptions for leveraging collaboration to achieve differential supply chain performance.

Some FIPs are industry-led, others are championed by NGOs. They range across many different fishery types, in both high- and low-income settings. Their diversity is notable, and their proliferation remarkable. This rapid growth suggests FIPs are becoming a key feature of the fisheries governance landscape globally. Based on a global sample of 107 FIPs, we systematically examined their reported actions, the actors involved, and their achievements in terms of policy and practice outputs. The most common actions were dialogues with policy stakeholders, data collection, and educational efforts directed at fishers. Common policy outputs included development of management plans and/or a management body, and rules for limiting entry and increasing compliance. Practice related outputs were dominated by gear changes, and observer and traceability programs. Only crab and lobster FIPs engaged in sustained policy conversations as one of the most common actions. Shrimp and tuna fisheries report more engagement in testing and implementing changes to fishery practices. While supply chain actors are involved in all FIPs, retailers and 1st tier suppliers are relatively absent from FIP activities, and are primarily involved in rallying financial support or some policy engagement. Based on our analysis we discuss the opportunities and challenges FIPs will likely need to engage with to contribute to a global transition to more socially and environmentally sustainable fisheries. We outline key areas where further work is needed to understand how FIPs can improve their contribution to global fisheries governance in the future.","[Crona, Beatrice; Kall, Sofia; Van Holt, Tracy] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden; [Crona, Beatrice; Kall, Sofia] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Van Holt, Tracy] NYU, NYU Stern Ctr Sustainable Business, New York, NY USA",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program; Stockholm University; New York University,"Crona, B; Käll, S (corresponding author), Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden.;Crona, B; Käll, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",beatrice.crona@kva.se; sofia.kall@kva.se,,,Swedish Research Council Formas [2016-00375]; Swedish Research Council MISTRA; Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere Program of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences - Family Erling-Persson Foundation; NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business; Formas [2016-00375] Funding Source: Formas,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council MISTRA(Swedish Research Council); Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere Program of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences - Family Erling-Persson Foundation; NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Support for this work was provided by the Swedish Research Council Formas through project 2016-00375, the Swedish Research Council MISTRA (through a core grant to the Stockholm Resilience Centre), and the Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere Program of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, funded by the Family Erling-Persson Foundation.

A range of transnational and European Union (EU) regulatory trade policy instruments and market governance mechanisms have been established to achieve these goals. However, illegal timber and forest-risk agricultural commodities continue to be traded internationally. Both the EU and Brazil are part of the problem but can also offer solutions to mitigate the risks of trading illegal timber and forest-risk agricultural commodities. In this paper, we review the main transnational issues at stake and assess under which conditions EU forest-related trade instruments coupled with domestic actions in Brazil can effectively curb illegal and unsustainable commodity production and associated international trade. Shortcomings in the mechanisms for identifying illegality in production, trade, and consumption are identified and possible solutions suggested. Heated political disputes, insufficient political will for transformative changes to tackle negative socio-environmental externalities associated with global commodity trade, and the still non-effective use of available regulatory policies and market mechanisms contribute to international trade practices still far from achieving desired and internationally recognized legality and sustainability standards.

Over decades, despite challenges associated with health and hygiene, street foods have been informally accepted as part of the urban food supply system, particularly among the urban poor. Despite the importance of street foods to food security and employment needs in urban Nigeria and elsewhere, very little is known about the governance arrangements (whether formal or informal) revolving around their food provisioning practices. The paper explores governance arrangements that steer and shape food provisioning practices in Ibadan, Nigeria. Taking a social practice approach, the paper analyses the interconnections between governance and ready-to-eat food vending practices. It doing so, it draws on insights generated through a qualitative study incorporating in-depth interviews and participant observation methods to understand different governance arrangements revolving around food vending practices. The findings reveal that formal and informal governance structures are jointly steering and shaping practices of informal ready-to-eat food vending. They furthermore highlight the crucial role informal middlemen fulfill in informal food governance chains. These insights provide new avenues for thinking about food governance of urban food supply systems in terms of co-governance between formal and informal actors. They also provide empirical evidence that can aid policy application and implementation on urban food supply systems going forward. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of a co-governance informal food sector framework that recognizes and encompasses the formal-informal nature of the food sector. Such an approach recognizes and involves informal middlemen in the governance of informal ready-to-eat street food vending embedded in a larger framework of food system governance.","[Adeosun, Kehinde Paul; Oosterveer, Peter; Greene, Mary] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Adeosun, Kehinde Paul] Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria",Wageningen University & Research; University of Nigeria,"Adeosun, KP (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Adeosun, KP (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Agr Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",kehinde.adeosun@wur.nl,,,"Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) project under the interdisciplinary project: Food Systems for Healthier Diets (FSHD)","Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) project under the interdisciplinary project: Food Systems for Healthier Diets (FSHD)","The research was funded by Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) as part of Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) project under the interdisciplinary project: Food Systems for Healthier Diets (FSHD).

Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates cross-level network effects using survey data from theList of Taiwanese Central Satellite Production Systems. A total of 34 buyers (hub firms) and 106 suppliers (satellite firms) from 34 supply chains responded to the survey. Findings Findings confirm that individual firms' TSIs can foster co-specificity at the supply chain level, thereby improving supply chain integration (SCI). SCI can have a positive cross-level moderating effect on the TSI-performance relationship. Research limitations/implications These two key concepts, value co-creation and co-specificity, extend the theoretical application of transaction cost theory and the resource-based view to cross-level study by contributing to the research on the TSI-performance relationship. Practical implications This study's framework is a counter to the buyer-supplier-supplier relationships in which each actor who may have different goals can create value jointly and share benefits from their TSIs. Social implications Owing to high co-specificity, being embedded in a well-integrated supply chain can be a threat when the environment is turbulent; for losing strategic flexibility, co-specificity and embeddedness may result in a collective adaptation concern. High degrees of SCI may slow the reaction to environmental turbulence for both buyers and suppliers. Originality/value Individual firms' TSIs can foster co-specificity at the supply chain level, subsequently enhancing SCI. An integrated supply chain can be a collective asset that facilitates value co-creation. Individual firms can benefit from the sharing of collective value. SCI can also increase switching costs, thus reducing the likelihood of individual firm engaging in opportunistic behavior and cost safeguarding.","[Huang, Ming-Chang] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Bachelor Program Int Management, Touliu, Taiwan; [Kang, Min-Ping] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Global Business & Strategy, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiang, Jui-Kun] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Doctoral Program Ind Management, Touliu, Taiwan",National Yunlin University Science & Technology; National Taiwan Normal University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Kang, MP (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Global Business & Strategy, Taipei, Taiwan.",huangmc@yuntech.edu.tw; mpkang@ntnu.edu.tw; 0317@twelite.com.tw,,,,,,,101,27,27,11,103,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,AUG 21,2020,25,6,,,,,773,787,,10.1108/SCM-09-2019-0347,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-09-2019-0347,,JUN 2020,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, forests are disappearing due to agricultural expansion. In West Africa, cocoa production is a major driver of deforestation. This study examines the design and implementation of forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs) in cocoa supply chains in C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world's two leading cocoa producers. FSPs are voluntary policies of companies to combat deforestation, restore forests, and improve farmers' livelihoods. Drawing on 91 stakeholder interviews, we developed a conceptual framework to examine FSPs' theory of change, implementation and potential effectiveness and equity. Our findings reveal shortcomings in FSPs' design and implementation. FSPs are mostly narrowly focused on preventing illegal deforestation and only target farmers in companies' 'direct' supply chains, neglecting important landscape-scale approaches and processes. Companies also fail to include smallholder farmers sufficiently in policy design and implementation. Lastly, FSPs prioritise productivity enhancement but overlook the importance of addressing farmers' social norms and values. We provide recommendations on how to address the shortcomings to achieve sustainable cocoa production.","[Addoah, Thomas; Lyons-White, Joss; Kouakou, Keessy Maria-Prisca; Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Addoah, Thomas; Lyons-White, Joss; Kouakou, Keessy Maria-Prisca; Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England; [Cammelli, Federico] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Sustainable Agroecosystem Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Carodenuto, Sophia] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Thompson, William J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biol, Nat Based Solut Initiat, Oxford, England; [Renier, Cecile] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Victoria; University of Oxford; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Addoah, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England.;Addoah, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England.",addoahthomas@gmail.com,,,"European Research Council [949932]; European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union [degreesPINT MULTI/BEJ, R.8002.20]; Biodiversa+FNRS [NE/V018590/1]; UKRI Natural Environment Research Council; European Research Council (ERC) [949932] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Biodiversa+FNRS; UKRI Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","TA, JLW, FC and RDG were supported by the European Research Council (ERC), under the European Union's [Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-2007-2013)] or [Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme] (Grant agreement No. [949932]); KMK, CR were supported by the Biodiversa+FNRS Grant n degrees PINT MULTI/BEJ, Grant/Award Number: R.8002.20.

For tourism management, assessing and planning resilience is of growing importance since change processes and their interrelations have become more complex in a globalized, accelerated world, placing tourism under pressure to respond and adapt to various factors. Adaptation and transformation processes to changing environmental, social and economic conditions require initiatives by various tourism actors with different functions in the tourism supply chain, and on different scales of governance, to be able to assess, plan and manage resilience over time. Resilience as a concept has much explanatory power that requires more attention in tourism research, both from a quantitative network governance and a more qualitatively informed research perspective.

A systematic literature review on inter- and transnational collaborative governance of the textile and clothing industry,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,Review,,,,,,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; LABOR; SUSTAINABILITY; STATE; BUSINESS; FASHION; MARKET; LEGITIMACY; IMPACTS; LESSONS,"Since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, partnerships between actors from different sectors and countries have been joining forces to tackle major sustainability challenges. Within the textile and clothing industry, inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships have worked to address labor rights violations and environmentally harmful modes of production. Although research on these networks and partnerships has been increasing, it has remained heterogeneous. It derives from many different disciplines and research communities, leaving behind an opaque field of literature. This article provides a critical overview and a comprehensive understanding of research on inter-organizational networks and governance partnerships of the textile and clothing industry through a systematic literature review. It analyzes 301 academic peer-reviewed articles published between 1992 and 2018. It uses quantitative full-text bibliometric word analysis, followed by coding around the meta-framework of modes of governance, which provides an integrative framework for this field of study. Firstly, this analysis revealed four discourses referred to as Economic and Industrial Development, Ecology and Environment, Private Labor Governance and Workers' Rights, and Critical Ethnographies. Secondly, these four discourses were found to differ in their thematic sustainability challenges as well as in their variety of governance modes and partnerships. Research on economic sustainability tends to focus on modes of central and public-private governance; research on environmental challenges focus more on private governance of supply networks and; research on social sustainability tends to focus on more participatory, interactive and self-governing modes between multiple actors. The analysis provides a unique classification of scientific articles through modes of governance, which is helpful in positioning research in the debate, analyzing and comparing approaches and thus highlighting current gaps and opportunities for future research. The results indicate that both inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration is needed to address the identified dialectical and practical challenges, including increased involvement of research as a key actor in knowledge creation for governance and sustainability transformation within the textile and clothing industry.

Under these circumstances, the stakeholders rapidly required companies to adopt green-friendly practices. This study investigates how green-friendly practices and environmental disclosure supported technological capability, and then further discusses the moderating effect of environmental disclosure on the relationship among green-friendly practices and technological capability. From 2008 to 2017, using a dataset of 1487 observations from Pakistan's listed manufacturing firms, the findings found that green-friendly practices and environmental disclosure had a positive effect on technological capability and also that the interaction of green-friendly practices and environmental disclosure had a positive effect on the degree to which the green-friendly practices of the firm could achieve its maximum potential for technological capability. According to our empirical results, the variables are positively and significantly correlated in the long run. The results suggested that green-friendly practices positively impact the firm's technological capability. The findings also indicate that environmental disclosure has a positive influence on green-friendly practices and moderates the relationship between green-friendly practices and the firm's technological capability. Green-friendly practices can also help improve environmental quality by promoting investment in energy-efficient technology to boost domestic manufacturing while minimizing environmental degradation.

It is both about advancing performance measurement and evidence-based policy-making for sustainable development, and also participation and consultation at a wider, more global scale, than has ever been possible before. This paper contributes to the notion of SDGs as a wicked problem, answering calls for deeper theorisation, via synthesis with core ideas in the management field of decision theory. A case study on the wicked problem of deforestation and its links to supply chains, multi-stakeholder initiatives and SDG reporting, provides an illustration of the relevance of the application of decision theory to wicked problems, presented using a novel conceptual framework.

In the absence of strong territorial governance, zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs), corporate policies to decouple food production from deforestation, remain a central tool to combat this issue. Yet evidence on their effectiveness remains mixed and the mechanisms limiting effectiveness are poorly understood. To advance understanding of ZDCs' potential at reducing deforestation, we developed the first spatially explicit estimates of farmers' exposure to ZDC companies in the Brazilian Amazon cattle sector. Exposure was measured by determining the market share of ZDC firms from the first full year of ZDC adoption in 2010 until 2018. Our analysis evaluated how variation in this exposure influenced deforestation. We found the G4 Agreement, the most widespread and strongly implemented cattle ZDC, reduced cattle-driven deforestation by 7,000 +/- 4,000 km2 (15 +/- 8%) between 2010 and 2018. Additionally, had all firms adopted and implemented an effective ZDC, cattledriven deforestation could have dropped by 24,000 +/- 13,000 km2 (51 +/- 28%).

Based on social capital theory, this study explores the influence of green supplier integration on three dimensions of social capital accumulation, which further affect economic and environmental performances. To verify the hypotheses, we collect two-wave survey data from 206 Chinese manufacturers. Results show that green supplier integration significantly affects social capital accumulation. Relational and structural capital accumulations have positive effects on both economic and environmental performances, while cognitive capital accumulation only has a positive impact on environmental performance. Additionally, relational and structural capital accumulations partially mediate the effects of green supplier integration on economic and environmental performances, whereas cognitive capital accumulation only partially mediates the impact of green supplier integration on environmental performance. This research deepens the understanding of how green supplier integration influences firm performance via social capital accumulation, and provides a theoretical basis for firms attempting to enhance their performance.","[Zhang, Qiansong; Pan, Jieyi] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yisa; Feng, Taiwen] Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, Weihai, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Feng, TW (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol Weihai, Sch Econ & Management, Weihai, Peoples R China.",qiansong199101@163.com; panjy@nwpu.edu.cn; yisa_123@126.com; taiwenfeng@hit.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71702148, 71732006]; Taishan Scholar Project, National Social Science Foundation of China [14CGL006]; Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [17XJA63002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholar Project, National Social Science Foundation of China; Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71702148 and No. 71732006), Taishan Scholar Project, National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 14CGL006), and the Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 17XJA63002).",,112,100,100,8,101,,,,1478-4092,1873-6505,,,,MAR,2020,26,2,,,,,,,100579,10.1016/j.pursup.2019.100579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2019.100579,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results show that environmental information disclosure has a significant negative correlation to enterprise development capabilities. This effect between them has a time lag and will decrease yearly. The degree of the effect differs because of firm size, region, and nature of equity. The government should formulate scientific and proper environmental information disclosure systems according to the characteristics of different industries and encourage non-environmentally sensitive firms to disclose environmental information to reduce the negative effects.

Wasted food represents lost profits for the food industry, increased food insecurity in communities and the unnecessary production of greenhouse gas emissions, among many other detrimental consequences. Due to the large number of stakeholders involved in the food supply chain and the complexity of their relationships, there is increasing interest in addressing food waste issues through collaborative governance approaches, such as food policy councils (FPCs). Assessing how FPCs engage diverse stakeholders and organizations in food waste reduction efforts can provide important lessons for improving local food systems governance more broadly and contribute to the creation of more sustainable food systems. To do this, we leverage the theoretical concept of 'collaborative advantage' to analyze how FPCs foster collaboration, both internally and with external partners, to achieve policy and programmatic goals that individual stakeholders could not achieve alone. Drawing on plan documents and semi-structured interviews with members of five FPCs across the USA, we find that FPCs can foster collaborative advantage by establishing comprehensive food system plans, systematically measuring progress toward objectives, and transparently communicating the evidence of their progress to the communities they serve.","[Nadeau, Nikki] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Koebele, Elizabeth A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Koebele, EA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Polit Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",ekoebele@unr.edu,,,,,,,46,4,4,1,17,,,,1742-1705,1742-1713,,,,JUL 3,2023,38,,,,,,,,e32,10.1017/S1742170523000285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742170523000285,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",,Agriculture,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examine this question using Scope 1 and upstream Scope 3 emission data reported by firms or estimated by S&P Trucost from 2002 to 2020. Our empirical results reveal that voluntary disclosing firms tend to have lower levels of internal emissions (i.e., Scope 1 emissions) and yet higher levels of external emissions from upstream suppliers (i.e., estimated upstream Scope 3 emissions). Overall, disclosing firms tend to have more emissions in the entire supply chain. A plausible explanation is that they may outsource more emissions to upstream suppliers than non-disclosing firms. By exploring the potential mechanisms that explain our results, we find that disclosing firms tend to exert more effort to reduce their internal emissions and outsource more carbon-intensive operations to suppliers. This finding is consistent with their decreasing Scope 1 emissions and increasing Scope 3 emissions. In addition to examining differences in emissions between high- and low-emission industries and across regions, we also investigate the implications of mandatory environmental reporting regulations by different governments and find these regulations can effectively nudge disclosing firms to reduce total emissions, including Scope 1 and Scope 3. As more regulations require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, our findings highlight the necessity for firms to develop processes and exert efforts to measure, monitor, and control both in-house and outsourced emissions. Additionally, our findings indicate that Environmental, Social, and Governance investment managers should perform due diligence rather than solely relying on firms that disclose their Scope 1 emissions.","[Shi, Yilin; Wu, Jing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Business Sch, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Christopher S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tang, CS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, 110 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",chris.tang@anderson.ucla.edu,,,"University of Zurich, Hong Kong University, Stanford University; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [72201230]; Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [14504621]; Government of the HKSAR","University of Zurich, Hong Kong University, Stanford University; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Government of the HKSAR","The authors are grateful to the audience at EMPOM Workshop, INFORMS, POMS-HK, and seminar participants at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Zurich, Hong Kong University, Stanford University, and UCLA Law School for their valuable comments.

Effectuating these standards requires the collaboration among and between creators (typically firms and nongovernmental organizations) and adopters (firms across a particular supply chain). However, the need to collaborate does not rule out the presence of controversy. Drawing on the case of the Marine Stewardship Council, a leading seafood standard to conserve the world's threatened marine fauna, we analyze how this controversy, from economic and sociologic vantage points, impacts a sustainability transition. In essence, interest divergence drives controversy over standard design, which spurs controversy over standard effectiveness and prompts the proliferation of competing standards. Controversy is magnified by the opacity or nontransparency of the fields which such standards seek to govern. We conclude that, while interest divergence and field opacity entail inherent controversy over voluntary environmental standards, the impact of this controversy on sustainability transitions is typically predominantly positive.","[Wijen, Frank] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Mandeville Bldg T07-38,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Chiroleu-Assouline, Mireille] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Paris School of Economics,"Wijen, F (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Mandeville Bldg T07-38,Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",fwijen@rsm.nl,,,French National Research Agency [ANR-15-CE05-0008-01]; Investissements d'avenir programme [ANR-17-EURE-001]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-15-CE05-0008] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Investissements d'avenir programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Mireille Chiroleu-Assouline received financial support from the French National Research Agency (ANR-15-CE05-0008-01) and the Investissements d'avenir programme (ANR-17-EURE-001).",,168,36,37,2,35,,,,1086-0266,1552-7417,,,,JUN,2019,32,2,,,SI,,98,124,,10.1177/1086026619831449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1086026619831449,,,,Environmental Studies; Management,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics,,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper considers the disappointment avoidance behavior and altruistic behavior of decision-makers in the context of uncertain consumer green preferences, and constructs a differential game model for green supply chain management consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under four decision-making modes. Through mathematical deduction and simulation based on the data of Green company and Walmart company, the results show that: (1) Under the four decision-making modes, the disappointment avoidance degree of decision-makers negatively affects manufacturer's green technology innovation behavior, but does not affect retailer's green advocacy behavior; (2)The altruistic preference coefficient has a positive effect on retailer's green advocacy efforts, while its impact on manufacturer's green technology innovation efforts is uncertain; (3)Under the four decision-making modes, the optimal green advocacy efforts of retailer are the highest under centralized decision, and the lowest under no cost sharing decision. Cost sharing and altruistic preference coefficient help to improve the optimal green advocacy efforts of retailer under the decentralized scenarios. While the relative size of manufacturer's green technology innovation efforts under four decision-making is uncertain, which is related to the disappointment avoidance utility of retailers.

A semi-structured interview approach was used for 19 interviews to attain critical perspectives of NGOs on environmental reporting. Thematic analysis through the lens of legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory is undertaken to identify themes and patterns that emerged from the study. Findings of this study reveal that the lack of quantity and quality when it comes to corporate environmental reports are serious issues, thus activating civil society's criticism. Quality issues are dominant for the lack of reliance on voluntary environmental reporting by NGOs. The government's monitoring and regulatory compliance systems is key, which has been highlighted as another factor. NGOs prefer government information over environmental information reported by companies. There is strong support for third-party verification and assurance to make the reports more reliable and useful. This study adds to the environmental disclosures and reporting literature by providing insights into civil society perspectives on corporate environmental reporting in the context of a developing country-Thailand. It sheds light on how companies can improve their stakeholder management and engagement strategy. It provides recommendations which may be used to inform relevant policy makers in improving Thai disclosure regulation and compliance mechanisms to promote greater monitoring and accountability. It also suggests companies further explore and examine potential technologies to support their reporting.","[Wichianrak, Jittima] Prince Songkla Univ, Hat Yai Campus, Hat Yai 90110, Thailand; [Khan, Tehmina] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Teh, David] RMIT Univ, Coll Business & Law, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Dellaportas, Steven] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou IBSS, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China",Prince of Songkla University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Khan, T (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",tehmina.khan@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,133,2,3,9,39,,,,,2071-1050,,,,APR,2023,15,7,,,,,,,6195,10.3390/su15076195,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15076195,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Corporate social responsibility performance is measured with a composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) score and with its three sub-dimensions between 2011 and 2018. Fixed Effects regression analysis was run to test the hypotheses, and subsequently, Ordinary Least Squares regression was run to test the robustness of the results. The results suggest that board gender diversity is positively associated with overall corporate social responsibility performance and governance performance. Moreover, the firms which have a sustainability committee are more likely to have greater corporate social responsibility performance (both overall and social) than those do not. Furthermore, firms with diffused ownership structures are more likely to show greater performance in the Social Pillar of corporate social responsibility. Board independence has a weak association with only governance performance. Contrary to expectations, the results regarding the value relevance of corporate social responsibility performance did not produce significant positive outcomes. These findings confirm that women on boards and corporate social responsibility committees are an essential factor to achieve corporate social responsibility goals. However, the insignificant relationship between board characteristics and the Environmental Pillar of corporate social responsibility performance is quite surprising, and the discovery sparks various queries. Finally, logistics firms need to reconsider the competency or role of independent directors in corporate social responsibility issues as currently they are weakly influential.","[Govindan, Kannan] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Danish Inst Adv Study, Dept Technol & Innovat, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Kilic, Merve] Samsun Univ, Dept Int Trade & Management, Samsun, Turkey; [Uyar, Ali] La Rochelle Business Sch, Excelia Grp, La Rochelle, France; [Karaman, Abdullah S.] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Kuwait, Kuwait",Shanghai Maritime University; University of Southern Denmark; Samsun University; American University of the Middle East,"Govindan, K (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",kgov@iti.sdu.dk,,,,,,,108,115,116,38,420,,,,0925-5273,1873-7579,,,,JAN,2021,231,,,,,,,,107835,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107835,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107835,,,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This was done so that it could potentially be useful as a supportive mechanism for smart technologies applied under the smart city concept. To facilitate this, tradable white certificates (TWCs) have been implemented as popular financial instruments used by energy-intensive sectors to boost cleaner production. In this study, we address an industrial EEP development with a TWC instrument as a multi-agent problem. We study this problem for the first time in the context of a supply chain that includes a manufacturer, an energy producer, and household energy consumers. Furthermore, we explore a new monopolistic pricing model for energy services and energy-efficient products, regarding the rebound effect, energy consumption, and social welfare. Additionally, we discuss two revenue-cost-sharing contracts and compare them as contracts using a comprehensive parametric and experimental analysis. The results show that the second proposed contract has some advantages over the first one.

Drawing on resource dependence theory, we aim to develop a theoretical framework that examines the relationship between customer concentration, manufacturer industry competition, and ESG performance. Design/methodology/approach To test hypotheses, this study utilizes a panel ordinary least squares regression using 10,348 samples from manufacturing firms in the U.S. between 2002 and 2020. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis are also conducted for robustness, in addition to a supplementary analysis that disaggregates ESG into its subdimensions. Findings While customer concentration negatively impacts manufacturing firms' ESG performance, this relationship is moderated by manufacturer industry competition. Furthermore, depending on the level of manufacturer industry competition, customer concentration may either hinder or enhance ESG performance. Specifically, customer concentration hinders ESG performance under high manufacturer industry competition but enhances it under low manufacturer industry competition. Originality/value This study underscores the critical yet nuanced role of customer concentration in shaping manufacturing firms' ESG performance by introducing an external factor that frames the context for various dynamics in the supply chain.","[Na, Jaeseog] Duksung Womens Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Sim, Jeongeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Young Soo] Kookmin Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Duksung Women's University; Seoul National University (SNU); Kookmin University,"Sim, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea.",jsna@duksung.ac.kr; jeongeun@snu.ac.kr; youngsoo@kookmin.ac.kr,,,,,,,46,0,0,2,2,,,,1741-038X,1758-7786,,,,2025 MAR 25,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/JMTM-10-2024-0550,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JMTM-10-2024-0550,,MAR 2025,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Management",,Engineering; Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sugar, Farmland and Health",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,Social License; Corporate Accountability; Australia; Financialisation; Investment,PRIVATE EQUITY; LAND; FOOD; INVESTMENT; FINANCIALIZATION; VALUES; TRANSFORMATION; AGRIBUSINESS; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE,"Background: This paper examines the exclusion of public health from social license narratives within an increasingly financialised food system, through a case study of foreign ownership in the Australian sugar industry. As finance actors such as asset management firms, pension funds, private equity funds, state owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds engage in speculative farmland investment, commodity futures trading, and the conversion of farmland into a financial asset, power within agro-industrial food supply chains becomes increasingly concentrated. This has been associated with increased food prices and more processed food, contributing to obesogenic diets, hunger, and poorer health outcomes for many. The potential for negative social and environmental impacts has prompted awareness of the need for financial actors to demonstrate sustainability, responsibility and accountability in their farmland investments. Methods: This paper uses thematic analysis of qualitative interviews and key documents to assess four recent acquisitions of sugarcane land in North Queensland. We consider how companies' efforts to establish or maintain a social license to operate (SLO) intersect with their capital accumulation strategies. Results: Our findings demonstrate that the link between the commodification of 'unhealthy' food inputs (such as sugar) and financialisation remains outside the purview of financiers. Instead, agribusiness firms use narratives centred on biofuels investment and energy/food security to justify their legitimacy in the sugar sector. We organise our findings according to two 'narratives:' constructing trust and credibility through ethical compliance; and, biofuels expansion as a legitimate response to climate change. The concept of social license is much stronger in the second narrative, but health is largely missing. Conclusion: The 'distancing' between responsibility and health outcomes highlights the limits to principles of responsible financial investment, and to the legitimacy of finance to claim an SLO - the ongoing approval and acceptance by society to conduct its activities.","[Smith, Kiah; Lawrence, Geoffrey] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Smith, K (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",k.smith2@uq.edu.au,,,"Australian Research Council [DE190101126, DP 160101318]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924243]; Norwegian Research Council [220691]; Australian Research Council [DE190101126] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Dr. Kiah Smith is funded by the Australian Research Council (DE190101126) .

Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance impacts sustainability performance through the mediating effect of firm innovation. To this end, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was deployed to analyze data collected from the employees of manufacturing industries in Bangladesh. The results revealed that ESG performance significantly enhances the innovation and sustainability performance of manufacturing industries, indicating that the higher the ESG performance of a firm, the greater its innovation and sustainability performance. Furthermore, the results confirmed that firm innovation performance fully mediates the relationship between ESG initiatives and sustainability performance. The findings of this study provide policymakers and industry authorities with valuable insight into the role of ESG and innovation performance in improving sustainability performance. Specifically, the study sheds knowledge on how firm ESG initiatives and innovation performance impact sustainability performance in the manufacturing sector of an emerging economy such as Bangladesh.","[Zhou, Shukang] Zhongyuan Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Zhengzhou 451191, Peoples R China; [Rashid, Md.

However, these value chains are faced with technical, economic and institutional limitations, calling into question their long-term viability. Based on two case studies of alternative food chains in France, namely einkorn (Triticum monococcum) in Haute Provence and organic rice in the Camargue, we evaluated their capacity to remain both viable and environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. After assessing the traditional economic, social and environmental performance of their sustainability, we performed a network analysis to determine the survivability of the systems. The combined use of the traditional pillars of sustainability and the network analysis forms what we term the systemic sustainability. Results suggest that the einkorn value chain is characterised by a high degree of centrality represented by a producers' association, although the systemic sustainability of the chain is reduced by its dependence on a leading processor. As for the organic rice value chain, centralised power is exerted by three companies embedded in a strong network of actors characterised by diversified connections. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential interest of conducting a network analysis to better determine the sustainability of food value chains.","[Quiedeville, Sylvain] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Dept Econ & Social Sci, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland; [Bassene, Jean-Baptiste; Chabrol, Didier] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UMR Innovat, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Lancon, Frederic] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Moustier, Paule] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, UMR MOISA, F-34398 Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Quiédeville, S (corresponding author), Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Dept Econ & Social Sci, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland.",sylvain.quiedeville@fibl.org; jbassene@gmail.com; frederic.lancon@cirad.fr; didier.chabrol@cirad.fr; moustier@cirad.fr,,,French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-ALID-0006]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-ALID-0006] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The research was funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) grant number ANR-11-ALID-0006, within the framework of the Illiad project (Local and Innovative Initiatives for Sustainable Food).

Based on the supply and demand of ESG responsibility fulfillment resources, this study explores the impact of business environment uncertainty (including objective environmental uncertainty and environmental uncertainty perceived by enterprise management) on ESG performance and reveals the impact path of A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2009 to 2022. Results show that the objective environmental uncertainty and the environmental uncertainty perceived by enterprise management can considerably inhibit the ESG performance of enterprises. Compared with the environmental uncertainty perceived by the management, the objective environmental uncertainty has a more remarkable inhibitory effect on the ESG performance of enterprises. The mechanism analysis shows that uncertainty avoidance of financial intermediaries is the main path through which objective environmental uncertainty affects the ESG performance of enterprises, while uncertainty avoidance of enterprises is the main path through which environmental uncertainty perceived by management affects the ESG performance of enterprises. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the issuance of government environmental protection subsidies and the improvement of enterprise operating efficiency can considerably alleviate the inhibitory effect of objective environmental uncertainty on enterprise ESG performance, while government tax incentives, the improvement of enterprises' financial flexibility, and the improvement of strategic risk bearing ability can considerably alleviate the inhibitory effect of management's perceived environmental uncertainty on enterprise ESG performance. Optimizing the regional business environment can simultaneously alleviate the inhibition of the two environmental uncertainties on the ESG performance of enterprises.

Our mixed-method study revealed general accordance on the feasible inclusion of diverse sustainability criteria in SCLs, albeit with varying degrees of perceived essentiality. Within the confines of the data, some differences in viewpoints emerged based on respondents' geographical and supply chain locations, which were associated with the sharing of costs and benefits. Qualitatively, respondents found the idea of SCL harmonisation attractive but weighed this against the risks of duplication, complicated administrative procedures, and contradictory regulation.

This study investigates transport capacity channel structures and evaluates the merit of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives for logistics service providers. We consider two dual-channel structures for logistics service providers and freight forwarders: a combination of direct selling and reselling, or direct selling and agency selling. The findings indicate that an increase in cross-price sensitivity escalates selling prices within each channel and direct sales volume, but negatively impacts the agency sales volume. Furthermore, our analysis debunks the prevailing belief about pricing discrimination demonstrating that heightened consumer awareness of the direct selling channel does not invariably result in lower agency selling prices. It depends on the commission rate, which is a critical factor influencing logistics service providers' selection of an optimal channel structure. Surprisingly, the interactive analysis demonstrates that ESG initiatives prompt logistics service providers to prefer a structure that combines direct selling with reselling. On the other hand, as the agency selling channel's commission rate escalates, the willingness of logistics service providers to invest in ESG decreases. In summary, logistics service providers using a dual-channel structure should ensure consistent service features across channels and provide flexible transport capacity.

Using qualitative and quantitative information obtained through one-on-one interviews with 15 key informants, a household survey from 110 smallholder farmers and document reviews, we discuss constraints and bottlenecks engendered by value chain structures, processes and mechanisms in Ghana's formal seed distribution system. Seven main challenges were identified that undermine trust and hinder the expansion of HYVs: (1) the limited capacity of public institutions, (2) constrained capacity of the emerging private sector, (3) a lack of well-defined, fair and enforceable contracts between stakeholders in the delivery system, (4) land-tenure limitations, (5) poor forecasting of farmers' demands for seeds by research institutions and seed producers, (6) sparse marketing arrangements for improved maize seeds, and (7) concentration of power to control seed supply in the hands of few institutions. We argue these seven issues weaken power asymmetry within the maize seed value chain's governance mechanism to create nodal points that give prominence to key public institutions, NGOs, and research institutions who control the production and distribution of improved seeds. Ultimately, trust among actors and its value chain outputs is undermined, negatively affecting the commercialization, availability, and adoption of improved seeds. Moving forward, upgrading the maize seed value chain must be pursued through targeted public and private sector relationships that acknowledge diverse actors' critical roles in the value chain.","[Quarshie, Philip Tetteh] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Sch Governance & Publ Serv, Accra, Ghana; [Quarshie, Philip Tetteh; Abdulai, Abdul-Rahim; Fraser, Evan D.

Sustainable fashion is a broad umbrella term, which can distract attention from the differences between the individual subtopics and the sentiments ascribed to them. However, little systematic research exists on how the stakeholder activity and dominant sentiments vary across different sustainable fashion topics.Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on a social media analysis of 19,179 tweets authored by 1,819 distinct stakeholders on Twitter (now X) from 2007 to 2022. A large language model, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on understanding and generating human language, is used to conduct a sentiment analysis of six stakeholder groups and 81 keywords linked to sustainable fashion. Two case examples are used to highlight the differences in stakeholder perceptions of sustainable fashion.FindingsThe social media analysis demonstrates how subcategories of sustainable fashion significantly differ in terms of stakeholder interest, activity and sentiments. For instance, tweets on circular economy and relevant subcategories (closed loop, recycling, upcycling, etc.) are popular, whereas issues linked to environmental, social and governance (ESG) and due diligence receive little attention on social media. While sentiments toward sustainable fashion are in general positive, discussions on topics such as labor rights issues are consistently associated with negative sentiments across most stakeholder groups.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how stakeholders and sentiments vary across different topics linked to sustainable fashion on social media, which has become one of the main channels for communicating sustainability content. The findings thereby shed new light on dominant stakeholder positions regarding a wide variety of sustainable fashion topics.","[Blazkova, Tereza; Pedersen, Esben Rahbek Gjerdrum] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Blazkova, Tereza] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Social Data Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Andersen, Kirsti Reitan Reitan] Kongelige Akad Arkitektur Design Konservering, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen,,tereza.blazkova@sodas.ku.dk; ergp.msc@cbs.dk; kian@kglakademi.dk,,,Independent Research Fund Denmark (Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond) [1127-00024B],Independent Research Fund Denmark (Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond)(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),Funding: The study has received funding from Independent Research Fund Denmark (Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond) (Grant 1127-00024B).,,75,0,0,17,17,,,,1361-2026,1758-7433,,,,APR 9,2025,29,4,,,,,585,604,,10.1108/JFMM-05-2024-0184,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JFMM-05-2024-0184,,JAN 2025,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Corporate entities, especially the large supermarkets, have responded to neoliberal forms of governance and the resultant 'hollowed-out' state by instituting private standards for food, backed by processes of certification and policed through systems of third party auditing. Today's food regime is one in which supermarkets impose 'private standards' along the food supply chain to ensure compliance with a range of food safety goals-often above and beyond those prescribed by government. By examining regulatory governance in Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom we highlight emerging trajectories of food governance. We argue that the imposition of the new private forms of monitoring and compliance continue the project of agricultural restructuring that began with government support for structural adjustment schemes in agriculture and that these are most evident in the UK and Australia where neoliberalism is an entrenched philosophy. However, despite Norway's identity as a social democracy, we also identify neoliberal 'creep' into the system of food governance. Small-scale producers in all three nations are finding themselves increasingly subject to governance through private, market-based mechanisms that, to varying degrees, are dominated by major supermarket chains. The result is agricultural restructuring not through the traditional avenues of elected governments, but via non-elected market operatives.","[Richards, Carol; Lawrence, Geoffrey; Hickman, Emmy] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Bjorkhaug, Hilde] Ctr Rural Res, Trondheim, Norway",University of Queensland,"Richards, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.richards@uq.edu.au,,,"Australian Research Council [DP 0773092, DP 110102299]; Norwegian Research Council [202374]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2010-330-00159]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [202374] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This study was part-funded by the Australian Research Council (Project Nos.

The debate originally focused narrowly on contract responsibility of MNCs for monitoring of upstream contractors for sweatshop working conditions violating employee rights. The authors argue that the MNC upstream responsibility debate has shifted qualitatively over time to full producer responsibility involving an expansion from contract responsibility in three distinct dimensions. First, there is an expansion of scope from working conditions to human rights and social and environmental impacts broadly defined. Second, there is expansion in depth of this broader responsibility to the whole upstream supply chain without regard to contracting status. Upstream responsibility now includes all suppliers, including direct contractors and the chain of suppliers to such contractors. Finally, the change in CSR scope and depth has led to an evolution of CSR management practice.","[Schrempf-Stirling, Judith] Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Management, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Palazzo, Guido] Univ Lausanne, Business Eth, Vaud, Switzerland",University of Richmond; University of Lausanne,"Schrempf-Stirling, J (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, 28 Westhampton Way, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",judith.stirling@richmond.edu,,,,,,,123,64,76,1,93,,,,0007-6503,1552-4205,,,,APR,2016,55,4,,,,,491,527,,10.1177/0007650313500233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0007650313500233,,,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to its raison d'etre, reporting remained finance-centered, to protect financial capital providers. From the 1970's, the question of the interests of 'stakeholders' emerged, with attempts of 'social reporting', 'corporate social responsibility', 'environmental', and 'social and environmental' and finally 'integrated' accounting and reporting. These trends are reflected also in the European Union legal framework, both in regulation of especially financial intermediaries and the 'non-financial' reporting. This article is based on an extensive literature review, research conducted in the Sustainable Market Actors for Responsible Trade (SMART) project, and socio-legal and economic empirical research based conceptual analysis of the impact of these reporting systems and their relationship to financial accounting and reporting. The result of the research is that sustainability is reduced to focus on institutional investors and other members in the investment supply chain, and climate change issues only, and new regulatory solutions are required. Based on the most recent developments in EU law and in European jurisdictions, possible paths forward are envisaged to encourage sustainability in reporting and assurance, and through that, in governance.

Based on data gathered from a survey and in-depth interviews with executives from Hong Kong-based enterprises operating in Guangdong province, we examine the changing roles of government, market, and civil society actors in the reform process, focusing on various types of pressures these actors have exerted on business enterprises. Compatible with Mol's (2006) conjectures, ecological concerns have gradually gained a foothold in existing political, economic, and to a lesser extent, social institutions. Yet, the relevant actors and their patterns of interactions differ from what EMT generalizes from Western European experiences. Specifically, local governments are assuming a more formalized relationship with firms in regulatory enforcement. Among market actors, organizational buyers along the supply chain have exerted more noticeable pressures on manufacturing firms than industrial associations and individual consumers. Civil society, while remaining less of an institutionalized actor in the environmental policy process, appears to pose a perceptible threat to at least some firms.","[Yee, Wai-Hang] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Lo, Carlos Wing-Hung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Management & Mkt, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shui-Yan] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",National University of Singapore; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Southern California,"Lo, CWH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Management & Mkt, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",carlos.lo@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,44,28,30,1,58,,,,0305-7410,1468-2648,,,,MAR,2013,,213,,,,,101,129,,10.1017/S0305741012001543,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305741012001543,,,,Area Studies,,Area Studies,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim was to remove deforestation from the soybean supply chain and halt one of the main drivers of forest loss in the Amazon biome. In this study, we investigated changes in deforestation at the property-level for the period 2004 to 2014. The objective was to examine direct and indirect deforestation, defined as on-property displacement and cross-parcel displacement deforestation for soybean expansion in the Amazon region of Mato Grosso, the leading soy-producing state of the Brazilian Amazon. We used publicly available property and land use data to quantify deforestation associated with cropland expansion. Similar to previous studies, we found that direct deforestation for soybean expansion declined following the implementation of the Soy Moratorium. Moreover, our analysis suggest that indirect deforestation occurred already before the implementation of the Soy Moratorium, and decreased following the first period of analyses. However, slight increases of indirect deforestation in the more recent periods, combined with decreasing direct deforestations rendered indirect deforestation to be responsible for more than half of the deforestation associated with soybean expansion. While we acknowledge the overall reduction of deforestation for soybean, our results suggest, given the increasing trends of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2013, to address indirect deforestation within the Soy Moratorium. This may be achieved by zero-property-deforestation commitments and by strengthening the integration between supply-chain actors, the soybean and beef purchasing companies and the federal policies aiming to control deforestation.","[Gollnow, Florian; Hissa, Leticia de Barros Viana; Rufin, Philippe; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Gollnow, Florian] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 300, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Hissa, Leticia de Barros Viana; Rufin, Philippe; Lakes, Tobia] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Gollnow, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl,Suite 300, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA.",fgollnow@sesync.org,,,"National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the National Science Foundation [DBI-1052875, DBI-1639145]; Brazilian-German cooperation project Carbon Sequestration, Biodiversity and Social Structures in Southern Amazonia (BMBF) [01LL0902]; CAPES/SWB program [1047-13/2]; Elsa Neumann Scholarship of the Federal State of Berlin, Germany; German Excellence Initiative","National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Brazilian-German cooperation project Carbon Sequestration, Biodiversity and Social Structures in Southern Amazonia (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); CAPES/SWB program; Elsa Neumann Scholarship of the Federal State of Berlin, Germany; German Excellence Initiative","This work has been supported by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the National Science Foundation (DBI-1052875 and DBI-1639145), and by the Brazilian-German cooperation project Carbon Sequestration, Biodiversity and Social Structures in Southern Amazonia (www.carbiocial.de; BMBF: Grant no. 01LL0902).

Nature-facing elements, including resource scarcity and environmental regulation, have seldom featured in GPN analysis. So, too, GPN analysis emphasizes spatial relations between network actors over temporal change. We extend GPN theorization through a temporal analysis of industrial change, connecting manufacturing to upstream resource materialities and shifting regulation, and to downstream consumers increasingly concerned with provenance and material stewardship. To illustrate, we document a resource-sensitive GPNacoustic guitar manufacturingwhere scarcity of select raw materials (tonewoods) with material qualities of resonance, strength, and beauty, as well as tighter regulation, has spawned shifting economic geographies of new actors who influence the whole GPN. Such actors include specialist extraction firms, salvagers, traders, verification consultants, and customs agents who innovate in procurement and raw material supply risk management. Traditional large guitar manufacturing firms have struggled with regulation and securing consistent resource supply, although smaller lead manufacturing firms have creatively responded via novel procurement methods and marketing, developing closely bound, iterative relationships with specialist timber harvesters, traders, and with emotionally attached consumers. A cohort of tonewood supply firms and guitar manufacturersespecially in Australia, the Pacific Northwest and Canada, key locations of both resource and design expertisehave together altered material stewardship practices and commodity production. Niche strategies derive exchange value from rarity and resource innovation, embracing raw material variability, inconsistent supply, and the need for alternatives. How firms adapt to resource supply security risks, we argue, is an imperative question for GPN analysis.","[Gibson, Chris; Warren, Andrew] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Gibson, C (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cgibson@uow.edu.au; awarren@uow.edu.au,,,University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme [04/2015],University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme,This research received funding support from the University of Wollongong Faculty of Social Sciences grant scheme [grant number 04/2015].,,63,10,14,5,58,,,,0013-0095,1944-8287,,,,OCT,2016,92,4,,,,,430,454,,10.1080/00130095.2016.1178569,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00130095.2016.1178569,,,,Economics; Geography,,Business & Economics; Geography,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our test results with survey data collected from 154 manufacturing firms indicate the value of logistics information integration and inter-organizational trust on buyer and supplier performance particularly when they encounter unforeseen market changes. Regardless of the environmental uncertainty relating to the difficulty in predicting product demand, rate of cannibalization, and technological advancement, logistics information integration and inter-organizational trust are shown to provide transactional and relational mechanisms helpful for improving performance in the logistics chain.

Because each company defines its own zero-deforestation commitment goals and implementation mechanisms, commitment content varies widely. This creates challenges for the assessment of commitment implementation or effectiveness. Here, we develop criteria to assess the potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments at reducing deforestation within a company supply chain, regionally, and globally. We apply these criteria to evaluate 52 zero-deforestation commitments made by companies identified by Forest 500 as having high deforestation risk. While our assessment indicates that existing commitments converge with several criteria for effectiveness, they fall short in a few key ways. First, they cover just a small share of the global market for deforestation-risk commodities, which means that their global impact is likely to be small. Second, biome-wide implementation is only achieved in the Brazilian Amazon. Outside this region, implementation occurs mainly through certification programs, which are not adopted by all producers and lack third-party near-real time deforestation monitoring. Additionally, around half of all commitments include zero-net deforestation targets and future implementation deadlines, both of which are design elements that may reduce effectiveness. Zero-net targets allow promises of future reforestation to compensate for current forest loss, while future implementation deadlines allow for preemptive clearing. To increase the likelihood that commitments will lead to reduced deforestation across all scales, more companies should adopt zero-gross deforestation targets with immediate implementation deadlines and clear sanction-based implementation mechanisms in biomes with high risk of forest to commodity conversion.","[Garrett, R.

However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include 'smart packaging' that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.","[Benyam, Addisalem (Addis)] Simon Fraser Univ, Food Syst Lab, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Soma, Tammara] Simon Fraser Univ, Food Syst Lab, Sch Resource & Environm Management Planning, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Fraser, Evan] Univ Guelph, Arrell Food Inst, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Simon Fraser University; University of Guelph,"Benyam, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Food Syst Lab, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",addis@foodsystemslab.ca; tammara_soma@sfu.ca; frasere@uoguelph.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Grant [4352019-0155],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Grant(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The work from this research received funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Grant 4352019-0155.

Yet, despite the growing recognition of these initiatives by consumers and retailers in North America and Europe and the (subsequent) acceptance of their role in seafood distribution by fisheries and fish marketing industries around the world, seafood certification programs have thus far made little progress in Japan. Here, the evolution of the three seafood eco-label and certification programs in Japan is examined and insights into the ongoing challenges they face in terms of the domestic supply chain network, consumer preference and their social cultural attitude toward sustainability are provided. Despite an initial lack of success, seafood certification programs in Japan can be useful in enhancing consumer awareness for fisheries resource conservation and identifying Japanese domestic small-scale fisheries that are already engaged in sustainable fishing practices. A possible pathway for developing an eco-certification program suitable for the Japanese seafood market is provided through integration of environmental and cultural sustainability under the existing certification framework.","[Swartz, Wilf; Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ British Columbia, Nippon Fdn Nereus Program, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Schiller, Laurenne] Vancouver Aquarium Marine Sci Ctr, 845 Avison Way, Vancouver, BC V6G 3E2, Canada; [Sumaila, U.

The sector has gone through substantial changes in the past decade with the abolition of trade barriers and the increasingly dominant position of major retailers and brand owners in supply networks. The sustainability of clothing supply networks is subject to increasing public scrutiny. In this article, the characteristics and operation of collaborative clothing supply networks are analysed. Two contrasting supply networks - one for a major leading brand retailer and other for a major supermarket retailer are analysed and compared from a sustainability perspective. The challenges in assessing economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainability at a network level are highlighted. The results show a minimum compliance culture in the supermarket supply network, whereas the leading brand retailer demonstrates a much higher level of proactive and positive sustainability practices and actions across the network. The study highlights the benefits of a strongly collaborative network in helping to facilitate and enhance a sustainability agenda. The implications of the study are discussed for retailers, manufacturers and policy makers, as well as for the governance of collaborative supply networks more generally.","[MacCarthy, B.

It aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, emphasizing sustainability and responsible resource management. In this paper, we consider a remanufacturer's problem in choosing various technologies to form a Remanufacturing Technology Portfolio (RTP), a strategic decision affecting remanufacturers' efficiency, productivity, and contributions to societal and environmental welfare. To address the unique challenges posed by the variability of EOL product quality, substitutability among candidate technologies, and other considerations in the RTP problem, we employ a discrete choice modeling framework, specifically the multinomial logit model, to characterize the technology assignment process of unprocessed EOL cores. This application is novel in the remanufacturing industry. We reveal that the optimal RTP balances remanufacturing capability and profitability, consisting of a set of the most profitable technologies. Moreover, we identify conditions under which technologies are included or excluded from the optimal RTP and explore the impact of various factors such as selling price, salvage values, and production and material costs on the composition of the optimal RTP and the remanufacturing yield. This study provides valuable guidance for remanufacturers in strategically selecting technologies to enhance their performance and competitiveness in the volatile remanufacturing market, while advancing their ESG objectives. In a broader supply chain context, the findings suggest strategies to encourage other supply chain stakeholders to engage in ESG practices and offer insights on how government incentives promoting remanufacturing can be more effectively structured based on technological considerations.","[Cao, Ying; Peng, Xianghui] Penn State Behrend, Black Sch Business, Erie, PA 16563 USA; [Li, Guang] Queens Univ, Smith Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Meng, Kai] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Behrend; Queens University - Canada; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Peng, XH (corresponding author), Penn State Behrend, Black Sch Business, Erie, PA 16563 USA.",yxc673@psu.edu; guang.li@queensu.ca; k.meng@nuaa.edu.cn; xzp17@psu.edu,,,,,,,76,0,0,11,11,,,,1366-5545,1878-5794,,,,MAR,2025,195,,,,,,,,103959,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103959,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2024.103959,,JAN 2025,,"Economics; Engineering, Civil; Operations Research & Management Science; Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology",,Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Transportation,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims to describe sustainability the principal lessons from enacting SOSDE research for achieving goals in large manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach - This study is a case research commentary in the agricultural industry that contributes abductively derives six principal lessons from SOSDE research on introducing sustainability-focused manufacturing and product innovations. Operational processes in large-scale poultry processing plants in an emerging market represent the specific industry and firm domain of this case study. Alternative SOSDE simulation models of decisions, materials flow and outcomes with versus without operational innovations were constructed following one-to-one interviews with experienced farm managers and entrepreneurs. Findings - The principles demonstrate how large farms in a developing nation (i.e. Bangladesh) go about adopting radically innovative manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations to improve traditional operations. This study confirms and expands on the general observation that SOSDE can help achieve sustainability and environmental, social and governance goals, contribute new value outcomes by converting unused production wastes into valuable byproducts and introduce design efficiencies in production, supply chain and marketing processes. SOSDE complements, while being a revolutionary departure from, six sigma management programs that focus on achieving exceptional and near mistake-free manufacturing operations. Both represent distinct philosophies and sets of actions that sometimes can conflict with one another. Embracing both successfully in the same enterprise is a goal that may appear unreachable, seemingly impossible to achieve and yet represents a manufacturing/marketing epitome that is observable in exceptional enterprises. Research limitations/implications - This paper may generate controversy as well as advance interest in applying SOSDE in introductions of improved manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations aiming to accomplish radical improvements in sustainability goals. Practical implications - This commentary describes how using SOSDE and running alternative production simulations with versus without including superior, radically new, process innovations enable the firm to find and eliminate glitches in system changes and reduce the fear associating with breakdowns and financial losses due to inadequate knowledge of operating new industrial procedures and outcomes. Social implications - Introductions of superior radically new innovations in industrial manufacturing and marketing via SOSDE frequently include manufacturing firms embracing new environment sustainability objectives and additional marketable byproducts from the firm's main productions lines. This commentary offers details on how this process is enacted in poultry manufacturing in an economically emerging nation. Originality/value - Running simulations in SOSDE research offers a low-cost, fast and in-depth method to test what-if impacts of enhanced and radical innovations into product/service manufacturing operations - benefits supporting the recommendation to apply systems dynamics in business and industrial marketing.","[Shamsuddoha, Mohammad] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Management & Mkt, Macomb, IL USA; [Woodside, Arch G.] Wall Coll Business, Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",Western Illinois University; Boston College,"Woodside, AG (corresponding author), Wall Coll Business, Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",m-shamsuddoha@wiu.edu; arch.woodside@bc.edu,,,,,,,88,2,2,3,12,,,,0885-8624,2052-1189,,,,NOV 20,2023,38,11,,,,,2403,2416,,10.1108/JBIM-05-2022-0193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-05-2022-0193,,FEB 2023,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Stakeholders' increasing interest in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) activities and easy access to information makes maintaining authenticity essential. Any firm caught in hypocrisy risks losing stakeholder trust and damaging its legitimacy. Family firms willing to preserve socioemotional wealth are more susceptible to hypocrisy than general firms due to the family's significant influence on decision-making, including CEO (chief executive officer) turnover and legitimacy crises. This study examined the impact of CSIR (corporate social irresponsibility) on sustainability in two South Korean companies and assessed how internal factors (e.g., CEO turnover and succession) and external factors (e.g., market competition and environmental dynamism) influenced them. To this end, we employed a case study as the central methodology and conducted text mining, interviews, and financial analysis through content analysis. Our first finding is that CSIR negatively affects financial and non-financial performance in family firms. Second, family firms must make genuine efforts to restore their legitimacy. As per the moderation effect of CEO succession, the pivotal consideration is appointing an external CEO rather than whether the subsequent CEO is a family member. Beta chose an external CEO who was a family member, while Alpha selected a long-time company insider who was not a family member as the succeeding CEO. Alpha, which designated an internal nonfamily CEO after the CEO succession, demonstrated a financial performance resilience inferior to Beta. Third, firms must communicate promptly with stakeholders in external conditions. With internationalization and digitalization, stakeholders enjoy a greater array of choices, and the evolution of public media has heightened the prominence of CSIR. The diminishing reliance of stakeholders on a particular company, the active articulation of opinions, and enhanced knowledge magnify the impact of a company's CSIR on the sustainability of family firms.","[Choi, Jihun] Korea Univ, Business Sch, 45 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Roh, Taewoo] Hanyang Univ, Sch Int Studies, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Lee, Ji-Hwan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, 85 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 02455, South Korea",Korea University; Hanyang University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Roh, T (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Int Studies, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",j_choi@korea.ac.kr; twroh@hanyang.ac.kr; jihwanlee@kaist.ac.kr,,,,,,,165,8,8,13,71,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,JAN 5,2024,435,,,,,,,,140557,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140557,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140557,,JAN 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Namely, sustainability initiatives that encourage best practice management on farms for environmental, social and economic gains, and also product carbon footprints (PCFs) that estimate the climate impact of products across entire supply chains. Concern is sometimes voiced about the potential negative impacts of both on exports from developing countries, especially related to outcome-based PCF initiatives which involve complex calculations and could present particular burdens for small producers. It is argued here that both approaches have a role to play in the conservation of our environment, though both have advantages and disadvantages.

This study aimed to indicate how the approach to socially responsible supplier development has changed over the years (2010-2019) in the automotive sector considering the types of practices and the applied areas of social responsibility. The study was based on original and empirical content analysis research of sustainability reports of car producers. To identify changes in the approach to socially responsible supplier development (SRSD) practices, 17 criteria were identified within direct as well as indirect types of supplier development practices. Considering areas of social responsibility, we applied the core subjects of social responsibility based on the ISO 26000 standard. The findings revealed that during the analyzed period, there has been a recursive use of both direct and indirect SD practices by the car producers but to varying degrees. The environmental protection, human rights, labor practices, fair operating practices, and organizational governance issues were the major concerns. When comparing 2010 and 2019, a clear increase was observed within all identified SRSD initiatives. The study outputs and examples of SRSD practices of car producers can act as a role model for automotive suppliers as well as other industries regarding how to incorporate sustainability into supplier development processes.","[Habek, Patrycja] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Dept Prod Engn, Roosevelt St 26-28, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland; [Lavios, Juan J.] Univ Burgos, Escuela Politecn Super, Av Cantabria S-N, Burgos 09005, Spain",Silesian University of Technology; Universidad de Burgos,"Habek, P (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Dept Prod Engn, Roosevelt St 26-28, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",patrycja.habek@polsl.pl; jjlavios@ubu.es,,,,,,,52,2,2,1,15,,,,,1996-1073,,,,OCT,2021,14,19,,,,,,,6256,10.3390/en14196256,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14196256,,,,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Research on ESG is still evolving. Although a few studies have investigated the role of individual technologies (e.g., blockchain) in ESG, applying a broader set of emerging technologies in improving ESG disclosure and addressing its limitations is yet to be explored. Industry 5.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of technologies in enhancing ESG disclosure. This conceptual paper explains ESG from the lens of management theories and views, including stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, transaction cost economics theory, institutional theory, signaling theory, network economics theory, and the decoupling view. It then explores the application of I5.0 in enhancing ESG disclosure. The underlying values of I5.0 align with those of ESG, and I5.0 can support ESG functionalities. I5.0 is particularly useful in enhancing ESG disclosure authenticity, extending ESG disclosure from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing ESG reports, extending the scope of reporting to multi-tier supply chains, reducing ESG cost, and enhancing the overall efficacy of ESG disclosure. The paper also sheds light on governance aspects, challenges, and risks of employing I5.0 to ESG.","[Asif, Muhammad] Northeastern State Univ, Management Sci & Business Analyt, Tahlequah, OK 74464 USA; [Searcy, Cory] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Grad Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Castka, Pavel] Univ Canterbury, UC Business Sch, Operat Management & Sustainabil, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Castka, Pavel] Univ Canterbury, UC Business Sch, Res, Christchurch, New Zealand",Northeastern State University; Toronto Metropolitan University; University of Canterbury; University of Canterbury,"Asif, M (corresponding author), Northeastern State Univ, Management Sci & Business Analyt, Tahlequah, OK 74464 USA.",asif@nsuok.edu; cory.searcy@torontomu.ca; pavel.castka@canterbury.ac.nz,,,,,,,95,74,76,343,1067,,,,0040-1625,1873-5509,,,,OCT,2023,195,,,,,,,,122806,10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122806,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122806,,AUG 2023,,Business; Regional & Urban Planning,,Business & Economics; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It does so through analysis of the rapidly transforming yet diverse Kenyan poultry sector, characterized by growing commercial operations alongside traditional smallholder farming. Our research involves interviews with farmers, processors, policymakers, and agro-veterinary stores in these settings. We blend Chandler's (2019, p. 8) notion of antibiotics as infrastructure with value chain frameworks to understand how the structural role of antibiotics in agriculture plays out through contrasting value chains, with different implications for stewardship. Weak regulation and intense market-based pressures are shown to drive widespread antibiotic use in poultry value chains involving small- and medium-sized farms supplying open markets. Antibiotic stewardship through adherence to agricultural and food safety standards is more evident, though unevenly observed, in value chains involving large commercial farms and processors supplying corporate buyers. Our findings reveal the complex structural roles of antibiotics in maintaining producer livelihoods in an intensely competitive and heterogeneous Kenyan poultry sector. This highlights challenges with applying global AMR policy to transforming food systems in LMICs without appropriate translation. We argue that attempts to reduce and optimize the use of antibiotics in agriculture must be informed by nuanced understandings of the roles of antibiotics in food systems in specific places including where very different scales and models of farming and value chain co-exist.","[Hughes, Alex; Brown, James A.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Claremont Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, England; [Roe, Emma] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, England; [Wambiya, Elvis] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, England; [Munthali, Alister] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, POB 280, Zomba, Malawi; [Ziraba, Abdhalah] African Populat & Hlth Res Ctr, APHRC Campus, Nairobi, Kenya",Newcastle University - UK; University of Southampton; University of Sheffield; University of Malawi; African Population & Health Research Centre,"Hughes, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Claremont Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, England.",alex.hughes@ncl.ac.uk,,,The authors acknowledge funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council Global Challenges Research Fund (Award Number: AH/T004207/1).

We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.","[Temper, Leah; Kosoy, Nicolas] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Avila, Sofia; Del Bene, Daniela; Martinez-Alier, Joan; Roy, Brototi; Scheidel, Arnim; Walter, Mariana] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gobby, Jennifer] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Le Billon, Philippe] Univ British Columbia, Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Perkins, Patricia] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",McGill University; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Concordia University - Canada; University of British Columbia; York University - Canada,"Temper, L (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",leah.temper@gmail.com,,,International Social Science Council [TKN150317115354]; 'EnvJustice' project - European Research Council (ERC) [GA 695446]; Leadership for the Ecozoic program; Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral programme of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Economy and Knowledge [2017 BP 00023]; Government of Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council,International Social Science Council; 'EnvJustice' project - European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Leadership for the Ecozoic program; Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral programme of the Government of Catalonia's Secretariat for Universities and Research of the Ministry of Economy and Knowledge; Government of Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council,"This paper has received funding from the International Social Science Council for the ACKnowl-EJ project (TKN150317115354), the 'EnvJustice' project (GA 695446), funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Leadership for the Ecozoic program.

Here, we developed a novel framework to examine global food shortages from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and quantify the embodied environmental impacts of disturbed and alternative food supply chains. The conflict could soon bring a 50-120 Mt shortage of nine dominant food products and cause temporal global cropland abandonment and greenhouse gas emissions decline. By contrast, the partial agricultural recovery in the next cultivation season will raise global cropland use and greenhouse gas emissions by 9-10% and 2-4% (mainly in China and Europe). However, optimized food supply networks with prioritized agricultural expansion in higher-efficiency countries could minimize food shortages and food-mile expenses, offsetting the postwar environmental increments from agricultural recovery by 45-89%. These results validate a framework to simulate the global social-ecological system, and underline the resistance opportunities and tele-connected consequences of regional disturbance.","[Zhang, Haoran; Jiao, Limin; Jia, Qiqi; Lian, Xihong; Liu, Yaolin; Hu, Yuanchao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Limin; Liu, Yaolin] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Limin; Liu, Yaolin] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Li, Cai; Deng, Zhongci; Wang, Zhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 4300770, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen] Huazhong Agr Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Jiao, LM; Hu, YC (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Jiao, LM (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Jiao, LM (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Wang, Z (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 4300770, Peoples R China.;Wang, Z (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Terr Spatial Governance, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",lmjiao@whu.edu.cn; sinoo@mail.hzau.edu.cn; yuanchao.hu@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42371423, 52100214]; LIESMARS Special Research Funding; Wuhan University, Youth Innovative Talents Project in Guangdong Universities [2020KQNCX083]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2042022kf1071]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); LIESMARS Special Research Funding; Wuhan University, Youth Innovative Talents Project in Guangdong Universities; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (42371423, 52100214), LIESMARS Special Research Funding, the Start-up Funding of Wuhan University, Youth Innovative Talents Project in Guangdong Universities (2020KQNCX083), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant 2042022kf1071).",,65,1,1,7,47,,,,,2662-9992,,,,JAN 31,2024,11,1,,,,,,,191,10.1057/s41599-024-02667-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-02667-5,,,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coal-fired generation meets the criteria of longevity (abundance of energy source) and scalability (ability to expand to the multi-terawatt level) which are critical for a sustainable energy supply chain, but carries a very heavy carbon footprint. Renewables and nuclear power, on the other hand, meet both the longevity and environmental friendliness criteria. However, due to their substantially different energy densities and load factors, they vary in terms of their ability to deliver net excess energy and attain the scale needed for meeting the huge global energy demand. The low power density of renewable energy extraction and the intermittency of renewable flows limit their ability to achieve high rates of indigenous infrastructure growth. A significant global nuclear power deployment, on the other hand, could engender serious risks related to proliferation, safety, and waste disposal. Unlike renewable sources of energy, nuclear power is an unforgiving technology because human lapses and errors can have ecological and social impacts that are catastrophic and irreversible. Thus, the transition to a low carbon economy is likely to prove much more challenging than early optimists have claimed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For the purpose of this research, three primary producers, one veterinarian, three licenced abattoirs, one food processor, one distributor, one independent retailer and two types of food service facility, one from a franchise system and the other from a high-end restaurant were questioned regarding the current state of the industry, as well as the impact of sustainable development on their strategic plans. Findings - The Canadian hog and pork industry is currently facing strong competition from several fronts: the USA and South America, a population with increasingly sophisticated demands, a strong Canadian dollar and a significant increase in input costs, particularly in respect to oil and corn. To be able to meet this competition, and in order to prosper in an uncertain marketplace, marketing channel believes that it must reduce its production costs, increase product awareness in the domestic market and promote cooperation among industry members. Research limitations/implications - This research is mainly concerned with the Quebec hog industry. External validity has not been achieved with the current research. In addition, a lack of distributor availability to answer the interview questions limits researchers' capacity to extrapolate results to all retailers. Meetings with other food distributors would be required to verify the accuracy of results. Although this study is exploratory in nature, several appealing research avenues emerge. First, the research focusses primarily on members of the distribution network, but does not consider the consumers' point of view. It would be fruitful to study the impact of sustainable development on the perceived product quality by measuring consumers' intent to purchase. Practical implications - The principal point of interest that makes this case worthy of study and of potential application to future business modeling is how sustainability and sustainable development is perceived throughout various marketing channels. The Quebec hog industry faces strong competition from several countries that are able to offer a similar product at a lower cost. The mature market consists of a limited number of producers interested in offering a product on themarket at the lowest possible price. Social implications - When it comes to sustainable development and the hog industry, the economic and environmental aspects seem to be well understood by members of the industry. On the other hand, the social aspect of sustainability is not mentioned frequently and is often not a part of the leaders' main concerns. Nevertheless, members of the industry agree that sustainable development affects the Quebec hog value chain, and will remain a topic of interest in the coming years. Originality/value - To the knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate the use of sustainability as strategic cornerstone for a marketing channel in a mature market, particularly in the hog industry. Many studies have been conducted in a context of emerging markers. However, very few studies addressed the issue in an established economic environment.","[Labrecque, Joanne; Dulude, Bertrand] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Charlebois, Sylvain] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Guelph,"Charlebois, S (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,80,6,6,1,54,,,,0007-070X,1758-4108,,,,,2015,117,11,,,,,2630,2648,,10.1108/BFJ-02-2015-0068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-02-2015-0068,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

One promising approach for pest control relies on the conservation of semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale to encourage natural enemies of insect pests. However, this approach may require coordination between farmers to manage the interdependencies between the providers and beneficiaries of this ecosystem service. The main objective of this study was to identify hindrances to landscape-scale coordination strategies to control pests. To this end, we used a theoretical framework specifically designed to explore social interdependencies linked to ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a participatory research case study on pest control in apple orchards in southwest France to identify and describe key obstacles. We found four main impediments: (1) The perception of most stakeholders that the landscape does not deliver significant pest control services, (2) the challenge of coping with agroecological uncertainties, (3) an integrated vertical supply chain focused on pesticide use, (4) the existence of independent, non-collective alternatives. We discuss the potential of overcoming these obstacles or turning them into opportunities that promote a transition to agroecology and the integration of ecosystem services in farms and their supply chains.","[Salliou, Nicolas; Barnaud, Cecile] Univ Toulouse, INRA, INPT, DYNAFOR, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge, F-31326 Auzeville, France; [Salliou, Nicolas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Spatial & Landscape Dev, PLUS, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muradian, Roldan] Univ Fed Fluminense, Fac Econ, 9 R Miguel de Frias, BR-24220900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; INRAE; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Salliou, N (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INRA, INPT, DYNAFOR, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge, F-31326 Auzeville, France.;Salliou, N (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Inst Spatial & Landscape Dev, PLUS, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",nsalliou@ethz.ch; roldanmuradian@gmail.com; cecile.barnaud@inra.fr,,,regional government of the Midi-Pyrenees; INRA Metaprogram Sustainable Management of Crop Health (SMACH); research project SECOCO (Ecosystem Services and Collective Action) by the INRA Metaprogram Ecoserv,regional government of the Midi-Pyrenees; INRA Metaprogram Sustainable Management of Crop Health (SMACH); research project SECOCO (Ecosystem Services and Collective Action) by the INRA Metaprogram Ecoserv,"This research was funded by the regional government of the Midi-Pyrenees, the INRA Metaprogram Sustainable Management of Crop Health (SMACH) and the research project SECOCO (Ecosystem Services and Collective Action) funded by the INRA Metaprogram Ecoserv.",,66,16,16,0,34,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB 2,2019,11,4,,,,,,,1158,10.3390/su11041158,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11041158,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores the CSR activities of Chinese forestry companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and analyzes how they differ from their international counterparts. CSR contents, levels, strategies, and determinants are examined through a quantitative content analysis and statistical analyses. The results show that Chinese forestry companies' CSR contents, like their international counterparts, are diverse and include the environment, employees, communities, general social issues, consumers and products, investors and creditors, governments, and supply chains. Both of them focus on environmental and employee responsibility and pay less attention to community responsibility; however, their CSR priority activities differ. While Chinese companies rank employee responsibility activities first and environmental activities second, their international counterparts prioritize environmental activities over employee responsibility. Chinese forestry companies have four types of CSR strategies-reactive, focused, opportunistic, and proactive-and the majority of these companies adopt reactive strategies. Only a few Chinese forestry companies choose proactive strategies. Forest resources partially explain the variance in the levels of government responsibility among forestry companies, and the industry type influences the levels of corporate environmental responsibility.","[Li, Yanli] South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Lan] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University,"Li, YL (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",leeyanli@scau.edu.cn,,,Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2016A030313406]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong [2014WQNCX021]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71761147003],Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by Guangdong Natural Science Foundation, grant number 2016A030313406, Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, grant number 2014WQNCX021, National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71773031 and National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71761147003.",,59,4,4,2,42,,,,,2071-1050,,,,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,4379,10.3390/su11164379,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11164379,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research explores relationships between existing seaport sustainability and the current narrative that exists related to sustainability improvements. Thirty-six seaports were selected from North America (NA), Europe (EU) and Asia Pacific (AP) for analysis. Twenty-five (25) pre-defined indicators were used to identify operational trends linked to sustainability claimed by seaports. Each operation was assessed using publicly available data; using a mixed methods approach, descriptive statistical analysis for sustainability initiatives was performed to assess seaport sustainability efforts. Results show that EU seaports have made more progress in adopting various sustainability initiatives compared to NA and AP seaports, despite the public narrative of most seaport executives about their commitment to manage environmental impacts, and being good corporate citizens. Initiative most widely adopted include: greater emphasis on internal environmental policy and management - including third-party certification; investment in proactive environmental solutions; and enhanced stakeholder engagement.","[Hossain, Tahazzud] Serv Newfoundland & Labrador, Corner Brook, NF, Canada; [Adams, Michelle; Walker, Tony R.] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Adams, M (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS, Canada.",adamsm@dal.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; Nova Scotia Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship (NSGS),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Nova Scotia Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship (NSGS),This study was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada funded project Green Shipping: Governance and Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain and the Nova Scotia Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship (NSGS).,,89,82,86,7,75,,,,0964-5691,1873-524X,,,,MAR 1,2021,202,,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105435,,FEB 2021,,Oceanography; Water Resources,,Oceanography; Water Resources,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study empirically investigates the relationship between a firm's sustainability performance (in the form of an environmental, social, and governance [ESG] score) and its organizational resilience while considering the moderating effects of operational slack. To address these issues, we collected 1167 cross-sectional data points with samples in manufacturing firms from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research and the Wind Financial Terminal databases in the year 2020, when the manufacturing industry is severely hit by COVID. Using the ordinary least squares and Cox survival methods to conduct regression analyses, our results reveal that a firm's ESG performance has positive impacts on its resilience in the form of stability and flexibility. We also find that three types of operational slack (production capacity, labor productivity, and inventory slack) positively moderate the relationship between ESG performance and stability. Additionally, production capability slack and labor slack positively moderate the relationship between ESG performance and flexibility. By doing so, we contribute to the emergent stream of research on the nexus of sustainability and resilience in the context of a global pandemic.","[Yan, Fangxu; Chen, Lujie] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Jia, Fu] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Nazrul, Asif] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Capital University of Economics & Business; University of Cambridge,"Chen, LJ (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China.;Jia, F (corresponding author), Capital Univ Econ & Business, Coll Business Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fangxu.yan20@student.xjtlu.edu.cn; jeff_fujia@hotmail.com; Lujie.chen@xjtlu.edu.cn; asn40@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,,"Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund [23JCA011]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2024J01214]; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University [REF-23-02-002, IBSSDF-0524-76]",Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by Beijing Municipal Social Science Fund (Grant No. 23JCA011) , Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2024J01214) , Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University under grants REF-23-02-002 and IBSSDF-0524-76.",,95,0,0,37,37,,,,0166-4972,1879-2383,,,,FEB,2025,140,,,,,,,,103167,10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103167,,JAN 2025,,"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The method delivers an innovative consistent date-stamping assessment for the exuberance and collapse of bubble episodes. We further investigate the interdependence and contagion effects of bubble behaviors in lithium industry chain. The results reveal that multiple bubbles in the Chinese lithium market are confirmed, which are basically accompanied by excess market fluctuations. The finding is consistent with the asset pricing model which implies both expected and invisible components exist in asset prices. The bubble contagion effect from lithium upstream to midstream is demonstrated, while the interdependence effect and bilateral contagion effect are confirmed within the same production stage in lithium industry chain. The findings provide important supporting basis for policymakers to gain a better insight into the dynamics of explosive behaviors in lithium industry chain and to construct preventive policies to maintain stable development of lithium market.","[Wang, Xiao-Qing; Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Qin, Meng] Qingdao Univ, Sch Marxism, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Qin, Meng] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Doctoral Sch Econ, Timisoara, Romania; [Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia] West Univ Timisoara, Finance Dept, Timisoara, Romania; [Su, Chi-Wei] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, 308 Ningxa Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Qingdao University; Qingdao University; West University of Timisoara; West University of Timisoara; West University of Timisoara; Qingdao University,"Su, CW (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, 308 Ningxa Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",awxiaoqing@163.com; awxiaoqing@163.com; nicoleta.moldovan@e-uvt.ro; cwsu7137@gmail.com,,,"National Social Science Fund of China [20BJY021]; Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization","National Social Science Fund of China; Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization(Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization - Romania)","This research is partly supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (20BJY021) and a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization, project with title Economics and Policy Options for Climate Change Risk and Global Environmental Governance, within PNRR - Pillar III, Component C9, Investment I8.",,70,13,13,7,64,,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,JUN,2023,83,,,,,,,,103725,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103725,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103725,,MAY 2023,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This includes the right to harvest and market trees that the communities planted. Along these lines, the Philippines' community-based forest management (CBFM) and smallholder forestry have the potential to meet the country's wood demand and contribute to its poverty alleviation goal. Realities on the ground, however, make this lofty aspiration seems too far-fetched. Formal and informal barriers along the timber value chain restrict the growth and obstruct opportunities for community-based timber enterprises (CBTEs) and smallholder forestry. Using the case of CBFM and smallholder forestry in the Visayas and Mindanao Islands in the Philippines, respectively, this paper examines the hurdles posed by regulations and informal practices, such as restrictive policies and increased transaction costs, through a segment analysis of the timber value chain. It argues that failure to address these barriers would lead to the decline of CBTEs and smallholder enterprises, thus undermining the merits of the forest tenure reform.","[Pulhin, Juan M.] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Ramirez, Mark Anthony M.] REECS, Project 4, Quezon City 1109, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos,"Pulhin, JM (corresponding author), Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Laguna 4031, Philippines.",jmpulhin@up.edu.ph; for_mark13@yahoo.com,,,Center for People and Forests (RECOFTC),Center for People and Forests (RECOFTC),"We would like to thank The Center for People and Forests (RECOFTC) for supporting the conduct of the study as part of the six country studies on timber harvesting rights in Asia.

The new Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) cattle certification program aims to reduce deforestation in the cattle supply chain, with a focus on Brazil. Drawing on information from interviews with key actors in Brazil, this article discusses the mechanisms that may enable the SAN cattle program to achieve these goals and to avoid critiques that have been leveled at other commodity certification programs. The program sets higher standards for sustainability than any existing policy or incentive mechanism. Participation in the program may generate significant indirect financial and non-financial benefits. The program may also influence the supply chain more widely: by demonstrating that certifiable, traceable, sustainable cattle production is viable; by raising the bar of sustainability standards through rigorous criteria; and by creating new markets and incentives. While the scaling up and impact of the SAN cattle program will depend in part on how it is supported or constrained by other interventions in the same sector, the program appears to be characterized by a rigorous program design that is necessary, if not sufficient, to catalyze reduced rates of forest loss.","[Newton, Peter] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, IFRI Res Network, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Alves-Pinto, Helena Nery] Int Inst Sustainabil, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Guedes Pinto, Luis Fernando] Inst Manejo & Certificacao Florestal & Agr Imaflo, BR-13426420 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Newton, P (corresponding author), 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",newton.pete@gmail.com,,,Imaflora; European Union (EU),Imaflora; European Union (EU)(European Union (EU)CGIAR),"We thank Mark Moroge and two anonymous referees for comments on a previous draft; the staff at Fazenda Sao Marcelo and Marfrig for their patience and insight; and Imaflora for collaboration and support.

Therefore, business firms are confronted with increasing social and environmental demands and are requested to take responsibility for issues of public concern. As a response, some business firms engage with corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects and directly contribute to the production of public goods.

I also argue that the politics of US agrofuels, focused on carbon accounting for greenhouse gas reduction and energy security, privilege urban and other actors' social and ecological interests over those of rural places of production.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Gillon, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",sgillon@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,113,42,55,1,35,,,,0306-6150,1743-9361,,,,,2010,37,4,,,,,723,748,PII 927238847,10.1080/03066150.2010.512456,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2010.512456,,,,Anthropology; Development Studies,,Anthropology; Development Studies,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Global initiatives emphasize the need to shift towards healthier and more sustainable diets, with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V). However, F&V cultivation relies on diverse high-value crop species that often require intensive fertilization and irrigation for optimum yield and quality, as well as a large labor force. This generates trade-offs across scales between the impacts in the production regions and the global need to increase F&V production. Through multi-actor dialogues, we analysed the social-ecological dynamics of the F&V agriculture system in Southeast Spain, which crucially supplies F&V to Northern Europe. Using a new approach combining the 3Horizons method and system thinking tools, our results reveal the agricultural system's context-specific structures as a foundation for exploring transformative opportunities. We found that the agricultural system a) is sustained in a governance model that lacks cooperation and fosters polarized views, 2) surpasses the biophysical limits, and 3) relies on immigrant low-wage labor. Additionally, our results underscore the need to share the responsibilities and costs of the food-system transformation across the supply chain actors, focusing on the potential of retailers, governance institutions at multiple scales, collective structures of farmer producers, and auxiliary industries to support sustainable and just transformative changes.","[Jimenez-Aceituno, A.; Roelfer, L.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Jimenez-Aceituno, A.; Roelfer, L.] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Social Ecol Syst Inst, Fac Sustainabil, Luneburg, Germany; [Lopez-Rodriguez, M.

Building on transaction cost theory, we develop the hypothesis that integration decreases to cope with supply volatility and technology uncertainty, and increases to cope with demand volatility and legal unenforceability. These four interrelated yet distinct characteristics jointly describe environmental uncertainties in a logistics outsourcing relationship. Our analysis of 264 such relationships suggests that integration does decrease with supply volatility and technology uncertainty and increase with demand volatility and legal unenforceability. By enhancing operational performance, integration improves outsourcing performance in terms of both financial performance and overall satisfaction. Lastly, operational performance also contributes to financial performance.

Evidence from China,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,,Article,,,,,,environmental governance; executive characteristics; pollutant emission; enterprise performance; environmental pollution,,"In recent years, the backbone of China's market economy has involved controlling corporate carbon emissions and reducing environmental pollution. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of senior managers and the carbon emission performance of enterprises. The empirical study used panel data on high-emission industries operating in the China A-shares market from 2014 to 2017. The results showed that the natural age, education level, and professional background of senior managers in high-emission enterprises were negatively correlated with the carbon emission performance of enterprises. However, in the case of large enterprises, there is no strong relationship between the natural age of executives and carbon emission performance, while professional background and education level are negatively correlated with carbon emission performance. However, natural age is significantly related to carbon emission performance in small and medium-sized enterprises. In the regional classification of enterprises, the natural age and professional background of the core executives of high-emitting enterprises in the eastern region are negatively correlated with carbon emission performance, while the professional background of the core executives of high-emitting enterprises in the central and western regions is positively correlated with carbon emission performance. Moreover, the natural age and educational level of executives are negatively correlated with carbon emission performance. To measure the carbon emission performance of an enterprise, the study used the balanced scorecard evaluation system (CEP). Meanwhile, it innovatively classifies and sorts the sample companies based on their overall size and distribution area, and analyzes the carbon performance and executive characteristics from two perspectives. The study provides suggestions and countermeasures for companies in China, especially those in high-emission industries, to help reduce pollution.","[Liu, Xun; He, Mengqi; Zhang, Shaoyong; Zhuang, Zhao; Cai, Cheng] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Accountancy, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Economics,"He, MQ (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Accountancy, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",hemengqi07@foxmail.com,,,"National Social Science Fund of China Research on multi-dimensional poverty reduction mechanism, utility, and promotion mechanism of farmer cooperative supply chain finance [20BGL068]; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education Research on the formation mechanism, evaluation, and control mechanism of Internet supply chain financial operation risk: Based on Symbiosis Theory [19YJC630108]","National Social Science Fund of China Research on multi-dimensional poverty reduction mechanism, utility, and promotion mechanism of farmer cooperative supply chain finance; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education Research on the formation mechanism, evaluation, and control mechanism of Internet supply chain financial operation risk: Based on Symbiosis Theory","This study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China Research on multi-dimensional poverty reduction mechanism, utility, and promotion mechanism of farmer cooperative supply chain finance (20BGL068) and the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education Research on the formation mechanism, evaluation, and control mechanism of Internet supply chain financial operation risk: Based on Symbiosis Theory (19YJC630108).",,35,0,0,8,52,,,,2296-701X,,,,,JUL 11,2023,11,,,,,,,,1076163,10.3389/fevo.2023.1076163,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1076163,,,,Ecology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These indicators were then scored for 331 companies based on the content of their sustainability reports. A factor analysis carried out on these indicators yielded five constructs: three for environmental sustainability and two for social sustainability. Bloomberg's environmental and social governance (ESG) ratings and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DSJI), which use private and public information from companies, served as proxies for actual sustainability performance. Upon testing, the constructs developed from the sustainability reports were found to explain the DJSI and ESG measures of sustainability significantly.

Their emergence is driven by specific local reasons and broader motivations, such as a favorable political climate and improved access to health and local food for all citizens. The rapid development of BDs has sparked significant interest from national and regional legislation, as well as from scientific and gray literature. However, there remain ongoing debates regarding the criteria for defining and identifying BD, the appropriate governance models to adopt, and the scope of their functions, particularly in relation to market and supply chain development. A three-round Delphi study was conducted to address these controversial issues and achieve expert consensus on the characteristics and potential direction for BDs as policy actors aligned with their mission. Beginning with a set of 12 open questions, the final round of the survey focused on the definition of BDs, their resilience in times of crisis, and their market strategies. According to the respondents, the specificity of BDs lies more in their functions than in their structural and organizational characteristics (such as the concentration of organic farming or the presence of a structured supply chain). Nevertheless, these structural elements must be pursued as objectives to enable meaningful territorial actions by leveraging local social capital. In this context, fostering interaction between producers and consumers and meeting local demand should be central to BD strategy. However, this does not preclude the possibility of entering national and international markets, especially when it supports the enhancement of local supply chains. Recent crises have served as a testing ground for BD governance, revealing that resilience is closely tied to the organizational maturity of the BDs.","[Sturla, Alberto] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Pol & Bioecon CREA PB, Dept Agr Environmetal & Food Sci, Savona, Italy; [Vigano, Laura; Vassallo, Marco] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Pol & Bioecon CREA PB, Rome, Italy; [Belliggiano, Angelo] Univ Molise, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci DiAAA, Campobasso, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); University of Molise,"Sturla, A (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Pol & Bioecon CREA PB, Dept Agr Environmetal & Food Sci, Savona, Italy.",alberto.sturla@crea.gov.it,,,,,,,106,0,0,2,3,,,,,2571-581X,,,,AUG 29,2024,8,,,,,,,,1433261,10.3389/fsufs.2024.1433261,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1433261,,,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The nature and impact of how the Chinese government uses its symbolic power to promote corporate environmental reporting (CER) have been under-studied, and therefore, this paper aims to address this gap in the literature by investigating the various strategies the Chinese government uses to influence CER and how political ideology plays a key role. Design/methodology/approach This study uses discourse analysis to examine the annual reports and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports from seven Chinese companies between 2007 and 2011. And the data analysis presented is informed by Bourdieu's conceptualisation of symbolic power. Findings The Chinese government, through exercising the symbolic power, manages to build consensus, so that the Chinese government's political ideology becomes the habitus which is deeply embedded in the companies' perception of practices. In China, the government dominates the field and owns the economic capital. In order to accumulate symbolic capital, companies must adhere to political ideology, which helps them maintain and improve their social position and ultimately reward them with more economic capital. The findings show that the CER provided by Chinese companies is a symbolic product of this process. Originality/value The paper provides contributions around the themes of symbolic power wielded by the government that influence not only state-owned enterprises (SOEs) but also firms in the private sector. This paper also provides an important contribution to understanding, in the context of a strong ideologically based political system (such as China), how political ideology influences companies' decision-making in the field of CER.","[Situ, Hui] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tilt, Carol] Univ South Australia, UniSA Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Seet, Pi-Shen] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of South Australia; Edith Cowan University,"Situ, H (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",hui.situ@rmit.edu.au; carol.tilt@unisa.edu.au; p.seet@ecu.edu.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.

Shifts in diets with different production and processing structures likely have a more considerable impact in future: higher land requirements (e.g., more animal-based proteins) or changing production regions and structures (e.g., higher share of (imported) processed food). Whether the expected transition in low- and middle-income countries that is considerably larger than in high income countries is resilient, is questionable. Beyond, the resilience of food systems is not consistently assessed and hardly synthesized for low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review based on a keyword search was therefore conducted to identify research gaps on food system resilience for low- and middle-income countries. This review identified three clusters of studies: studies in cluster 1 (global models and primary production) mainly model global (change) impacts on crop production, mostly disregard the downstream of the value chain and use globally accessible crop data (e.g., for cereals). Studies in cluster 2 (farmers' behavior under global change) mainly analyze with surveys and workshop formats the resilience of farmers and farming households under global change phenomena such as climate change and equally explore especially farmers' adaptative capacity. Studies in cluster 3 (food systems and value chains) take a more holistic perspective and mostly qualitatively analyze the resilience of food systems based on existing studies. Quantitatively, most studies model the robustness of food systems and not their transformability. Future research should quantitatively assess the adaptiveness and transformability of food systems and study the resilience of food systems beyond primary production. Studies should quantitatively model the impact between the food system and associated environmental and social systems and along the food value chain to generate relevant insights for food system governance.","[Meyer, Markus A.] Univ Twente, Dept Nat Resources, Fac Geoinformat & Earth Observat ITC, Hengelosestr 99, NL-7514AE Enschede, Netherlands",,"Meyer, MA (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Nat Resources, Fac Geoinformat & Earth Observat ITC, Hengelosestr 99, NL-7514AE Enschede, Netherlands.",m.a.meyer@utwente.nl,,,4TU Centre for Resilience Engineering (DeSIRE),4TU Centre for Resilience Engineering (DeSIRE),"The author would like to thank Andy Nelson and Rick Hogeboom for fruitful discussions on the topic of this paper.

Transnational non-governmental organisations and private standards-setting agencies have developed standards that cover a vast range of areas such as labour rights, social justice and environmental protection. As a form of private transnational regulation, certification standards travel through transnational production networks that link lead firms in developed countries with supplier firms in developing countries. This article draws on a case study about coffee certification to challenge the conventional understanding of transnational certification as a contractual conduit that transfers encoded certification standards from senders to receivers. It shows how transnational certification standards interact with, and remake local regulatory landscapes as they pass through. This interaction between global and local knowledge compels us to see transnational standards as a protean, highly localised regulatory process rather than stable universal norms.

The use of biofuels is expected to rise since national governments of developed nations like the US and European countries see it as one of the ways to fulfill climate targets and increase the security in their energy supply. Production of biofuels is also expected to rise as developing nations see in biofuels the opportunity for connecting to international markets through supplying a new demand in the energy market. Several studies report on the environmental, social and economic gains and detriments that can arise from increased biofuel production and consumption. However, research that provides insight into the way in which such issues are defined by actors within the product chain is scarce. In this article we analyse how the strategies and value definitions of actors involved in the production and consumption of biofuels lead to specific definitions of sustainability. The empirical material concerns the chain of palm oil production in Colombia and electricity generation in the Netherlands. It is analysed using the method of action-in-context, which allows us to uncover the level and source of diversity of sustainability definitions in the product chain. While the current growth in production of palm oil is definitely buyer driven, the analysis of various activities in the chain shows that several aspects of sustainability are defined in more complex actor fields throughout the product chain.

The ambition remains to recycle and reuse as much as we can; however, newly mined resources will be required in the near term despite the massive improvements in the reuse and recycling of existing end-of-use products and wastes. Growth trends suggest that mining will still play a role after 2050 since the demand for metals will increase as the developing world moves toward a per capita usage of materials comparable to that of the developed world. There are sufficient geological resources to deliver the required mineral commodities, but the need to mine must be balanced with the requirement to tackle environmental and social governance issues and to deliver sustainable development goals, ensuring that outcomes are beneficial for both the people and planet. Currently, the lead time to develop new mines following discovery is around 16 years, and this needs to be reduced. New approaches to designing and evaluating mining projects embracing social, biodiversity, and life cycle analysis aspects are pivotal. New frontiers for supply should include neglected mined wastes with recoverable components and unconventional new deposits. New processing technologies that involve less invasive, lower energy and cleaner methodologies need to be explored, and developing such methodologies will benefit from using nature-based solutions like bioprocessing for both mineral recovery and for developing sustainable landscapes post mining. Part of the new ambition would be to seek opportunities for more regulated mining areas in our own backyard, thinking particularly of old mineral districts of Europe, rather than relying on sources with potentially and less controllable, fragile, and problematic supply chains. The current debate about the potential of mining our deep ocean, as an alternative to terrestrial sources needs to be resolved and based on a broader analysis; we can then make balanced societal choices about the metal and mineral supply from the different sources that will be able to deliver the green economy while providing a net-positive deal for the planet and its people.","[Herrington, Richard Jeremy] Nat Hist Museum, Ctr Resourcing Green Econ, London SW75BD, England",Natural History Museum London,"Herrington, RJ (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Ctr Resourcing Green Econ, London SW75BD, England.",r.herrington@nhm.ac.uk,,,NERC; NERC [NE/V007068/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The author thanks the editors for the invite to write this paper based on a presentation presented at the SIMP congress in 2022 and the patience in waiting for the finished manuscript.,,84,1,1,7,26,,,,,2075-163X,,,,FEB,2024,14,2,,,,,,,204,10.3390/min14020204,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min14020204,,,,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This trend seems to cut across the traditional application areas of operations management (OM) and operations research (OR), and it coincides with an increased emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) values in industry, a greater prominence of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and increases in social impact research in other academic fields. In this paper, we pull together representative examples from our field of what we consider as social impact research aimed at improving living conditions at the BOP. We first examine the scale and scope of work published in Production and Operations Management over the last 25 years, and then provide a broader summary of the spectrum of research within OM and OR that constitute this stream of literature. We adopt the stance that OM and OR should embrace the current societal emphasis on social responsibility and positive social impact-and strive to contribute to the most pressing problems for those living at the BOP. Although our field has produced a body of work addressing such problems, individual research projects of this type are usually not viewed as falling under the broad umbrella of social impact operations (SIO), but rather are classified as part of the closest application area. By providing an initial overview of this work, we wish to celebrate the contribution of our field to this area, highlight common themes, catalyze a dialogue across application areas among researchers with a common perspective, and identify opportunities for future research.","[Jonasson, Jonas Oddur] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ramdas, Kamalini; Sungu, Alp] London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of London; London Business School,"Ramdas, K (corresponding author), London Business Sch, Regents Pk, London NW1 4SA, England.",kramdas@london.edu,,,,,,,188,11,13,21,100,,,,1059-1478,1937-5956,,,,DEC,2022,31,12,,,SI,,4364,4378,,10.1111/poms.13857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/poms.13857,,OCT 2022,,"Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These approaches investigate various sustainability dimensions, including raw material criticality, social, and environmental compliance indicators. To contribute to the growing interest in this topic, this paper investigates how material criticality can shape and enhance the understanding of drivers, complexities, and considerations in the responsible sourcing of battery minerals. For this case study, we use ten battery minerals, nine supply regions, and the integrated method to address resource efficiency (abbreviated ESSENZ), a criticality method developed to address the socioeconomic availability, the social, and the environmental dimensions of sustainability. To measure the performance of a supply region compared to other alternatives for a selected battery mineral, results per indicator are evaluated as relative scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 signifying the lowest relative criticality and 100 as the highest relative criticality. These relative scores, which provide increased resolution compared to globally aggregated criticality scores, show the strengths and weaknesses of supply regions for different criticality indicators while highlighting where efforts should be directed to address and alleviate outstanding criticality issues. Additionally, the resolution of the scores in this study is employed to classify supply regions into two primary categories: reserve-dominant regions, characterised by high reserves and productive activity but overall low socioeconomic and environmental compliance, and policy & governance-dominant regions, characterised by adherence to socioeconomic and environmental compliance but overall low reserves and production activity. This study underscores the complexity of identifying ideal sourcing alternatives with relatively low scores across all indicators, highlighting potential challenges to the sustainable sourcing of battery minerals.","[Manjong, Nelson Bunyui; Burheim, Odne Stokke; Omman, Anders Hammer Str] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Manjong, Nelson Bunyui; Finkbeiner, Matthias; Omman, Anders Hammer Str] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Marinova, Sylvia; Bach, Vanessa; Finkbeiner, Matthias] Tech Univ Berlin, Off Z1,Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Technical University of Berlin,"Manjong, NB (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",nelson.manjong@ntnu.no; s.marinova@tu-berlin.de; anders.hammer.stromman@ntnu.no,,,EIT Innoenergy SE [02-2019-IP172- FREYR]; SPIDER project [814389]; The Norwegian Giga Battery Factories [NorGiBatF] project [306400],EIT Innoenergy SE; SPIDER project; The Norwegian Giga Battery Factories [NorGiBatF] project,"This work was funded by EIT Innoenergy SE (grant 02-2019-IP172- FREYR) , SPIDER project (H2020 Grant Agreement n degrees 814389) , and Norwegian Giga Battery Factories [NorGiBatF] project (Grant n degrees 306400) .",,103,1,1,4,5,,,,2352-5509,,,,,SEP,2024,49,,,,,,289,303,,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.020,,JUL 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach This study focuses on coordination functions and activities between a buyer (a government department), a customer (a military service) and two service providers. Rich data on these normally confidential service ties are drawn from an official report into the causes of a fatal accident involving a UK reconnaissance aircraft and specifically from the evidence presented regarding the earlier development of its complex safety case. The authors also analysed a range of additional secondary data sources. Findings The authors examine the sources, drivers and manifestation of coordination failures. The authors uncover a series of coordination failures driven from the bridge position, revealing that while bounded rationality and opportunism influenced steering coordination failures, connecting coordination failures were associated with knowledge asymmetry, dyadic inertia and unethical practices. Practical implications Organisations and governments delivering complex projects and knowledge-intensive professional services should guard against outsourcing the coordination activity to a third party, thereby relinquishing the bridge position. Handing over the bridge position to an integrator would leave the client vulnerable to coordination dysfunctions such as bounded rationality, opportunism, knowledge asymmetry, dyadic inertia and unethical practices. Originality/value The study links the previously separate research streams of service triads and inter-organizational coordination. While extant research pays attention to mainly positive control functions, this study focuses on all three actors in two (failed) service triads - and highlights the impact of coordination activities and failures.","[Kalra, Jas] UCL, Sch Construct & Project Management, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, London, England; [Lewis, Michael] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Informat Decis & Operat Div, Bath, Avon, England; [Roehrich, Jens K.] Univ Bath, Sch Management, HPC Supply Chain Innovat Lab, Bath, Avon, England",University of London; University College London; University of Bath; University of Bath,"Kalra, J (corresponding author), UCL, Sch Construct & Project Management, Bartlett Fac Built Environm, London, England.",J.Kalra@ucl.ac.uk; mal20@bath.ac.uk; jr235@bath.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/S009841/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,90,24,24,4,37,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,MAY 3,2021,26,3,,,SI,,341,358,,10.1108/SCM-03-2019-0115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-03-2019-0115,,DEC 2020,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In an interconnected complex system, flexibility allows prompt deployment of resources where they are needed and is crucial for both innovation and robustness. A comparative analysis of flexible manufacturing systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and supply chain management is conducted to identify the most important characteristics of flexibility. Evolutionary biology emphasises overlapping functions and multi-functionality, which allow a system with structurally different elements to perform the same function, enhancing resilience. In economics, marginal cost and marginal expected profit are factors that are considered to be important in incorporating flexibility while making changes to the system. In flexible manufacturing systems, the size of choice sets is important in creating flexibility, as initial actions preserve more options for future actions that will enhance resilience. Given the dynamic nature of flexibility, identifying the characteristics that can lead to flexibility will introduce a crucial dimension to designing resilient and sustainable socio-ecological systems with a long-term perspective in mind.","[Asokan, Vivek Anand] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, GPSS, Rm 334,Bldg Environm Studies,5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Yarime, Masaru] City Univ Hong Kong, SEE, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yarime, Masaru] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Yarime, Masaru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy GraSPP, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Esteban, Miguel] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, GPSS, Rm 204b,Bldg Environm Studies,5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan",University of Tokyo; City University of Hong Kong; University of London; University College London; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Yarime, M (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, SEE, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yarime, M (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy STEaPP, London WC1E 6BT, England.;Yarime, M (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy GraSPP, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",viv.asok@gmail.com; yarimemasa@gmail.com; esteban.fagan@gmail.com,,,"MONBUKAGAKUSHO (MEXT), Government of Japan","MONBUKAGAKUSHO (MEXT), Government of Japan","We acknowledge MONBUKAGAKUSHO (MEXT), Government of Japan, for their financial assistance for this study.

Environmental harm, including climate change and biodiversity loss, occurs along the supply chains associated with trans-national corporations' (TNCs') practices and products. In essence, the corporatization of the global food system has created the conditions that cultivate excess consumption, manufacture disease epidemics and harm the environment. TNCs have used their structural power - their positions in material structures and organizational networks - to establish rules, processes and norms that reinforce and extend the paradigm of the neoliberal corporate food system. As a result, policy and regulatory environments, and societal norms are favourable to TNC's interests, to the detriment of nutrition, health and environmental outcomes. There is hope, however. Power, of which there is many forms, is held not just by the TNCs but by all actors concerned about and connected to the food system. This paper aims to understand these power dynamics, and identify how structurally weak, public-interest actors can release their agency and work to achieve positive structural change. Such an analysis will help understand how the status quo can be disrupted and healthy and sustainable food systems created. The paper draws from the health governance and social movement literature, examining the Doha Declaration on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Public Health, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and the Divestment movement. These cases demonstrate the many 'weapons of the weak' that can, against all odds recalibrate structural inequities. There is no one approach to transforming the corporate food system to become a healthy and sustainable food system. It involves coalition building; articulation of an ambitious shared vision; strategic use of multi-level institutional processes; social mobilization among like-minded and unusual bedfellows, and organized campaigns; political and policy entrepreneurs, and compelling issue framing.","[Friel, Sharon] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Regulat & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Friel, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Regulat & Global Governance, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",Sharon.friel@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,71,24,24,2,10,,,,,2322-5939,,,,DEC,2021,10,12,,,SI,,784,792,,10.34172/ijhpm.2020.205,http://dx.doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.205,,OCT 2020,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Supporting the identification of strategies that best minimise these impacts on people, planet and profit, this paper explores the dynamic impacts of food waste management options on the triple bottom lines of sustainable development in urban circular economies. We present a system dynamics model of the urban agri-food supply chain. This model simulates the fluxes of food and food waste throughout the supply chain, as well as their impacts on economy (i.e., costs and benefits for each sector and the broader economy), society (i.e., food insecurity) and environment (i.e., water, energy, and carbon footprints). Using Bristol city in the United Kingdom as a case-study, we evaluate the impacts of seven food waste management options (i.e., reduction, redistribution, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, composting, incineration, and landfilling). The results show that food waste reduction in consumer sectors (i.e., households and hospitality and food services) and redistribution in supply sectors (i.e., primary production and manufacture) offer the greatest benefits for the environment, society, and economy. For the retail sector, both reduction and redistribution options are highly favourable. Although these options can potentially have some adverse economic effects on the supply side due to a reduction in demand, their considerably high benefits make them high-reward, lowrisk options. We thus conclude that food waste reduction and redistribution are the only options with a clear triple-win for people, planet and profit. This paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a robust quantitative model and a novel triple bottom line framework for sustainable food waste management in urban circular economies.","[Parsa, Ali; Van De Wiel, Marco; Schmutz, Ulrich; Fried, Jana] Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Van De Wiel, Marco] UNISA, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Taylor, Ivan] Policy Dynam Inc, New Hamburg, ON, Canada",Coventry University; University of South Africa,"Parsa, A (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Ctr Agroecol Water & Resilience, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",parsaa@coventry.ac.uk,,,Belmont Forum (UK ESRC) [ES/S002243/1]; Coventry University; ESRC [ES/S002243/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Belmont Forum (UK ESRC); Coventry University; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work is part of the Waste FEW-ULL project (https://wastefe wull.weebly.com /) , which was funded by the Belmont Forum (UK ESRC grant ES/S002243/1) .

OBJECTIVE: The main aims of the work are: i. to support the identification of marginal land for agricultural uses and, specifically, for bioenergy crops in Mediterranean contexts, according to the recent European and worldwide energy crisis; ii. to overturn the vision of these contexts, from problem to opportunity for the relaunch of local economies, the care of the landscape and respect for ecosystems; iii. to support the decision makers activity, for a medium-long term landscape governance and, at the same time, the interests of farmers and local communities, in guaranteeing opportunities for economic growth and environmental/social returns. METHODS: The methodological approach encompasses two main activities: i. the marginal lands identification; ii. the bioenergy scenarios building. They belong to land-use/landscape planning approaches and support the decision makers in the integrations of different criteria and stakeholders points of views. According to literature, the geo-morphologic, agronomic and socio-economic conditions were analyzed using a spatial-multicriteria decision analysis and target modelling tools. The ecosystems services approach, their mapping and quantification, via a dedicated software, were used to support the process still in the analysis phase and in the marginal lands identification one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A considerably huge area (approximately 7730 km2) 2 ) was identified as marginal for traditional agricultural uses. Marginality factors are both physical (soil, climatic, agronomic conditions) and social (population structure, depopulation, employment). The study area ecosystem services assessment also confirms lower values than the regional averages. The results highlight the need for decision-makers to monitor these contexts to stem the effects, as well as to provide suitable socio-economic development policies capable of recovering those territories that in the past have held up the regional economy. The energy crops scenarios building can support different production chains (ligno-cellulosic biomass, seeds, oils), and the energy conversion plants types. SIGNIFICANCE: The present work proved to be useful in the meta-analysis study-phase for identifying marginal lands, allowing a significant reduction in analysis costs and times. Although the study is focused on a specific Mediterranean context, the approach can provide scientific guidance for marginal lands identification and management (related to energy crops scenarios) and a support for the ecosystem services restoration. In these terms, the study supports both potential market investors for estimating expected profits, and policy makers for landscape management and land use changes. The integration of multi-criteria assessments and species distribution models supports the choice of specific such as: facing climatic needs, mitigating morphological characteristics, making up for agronomic deficiencies, supporting the population with social policies and incentives for agricultural activities.","[Cervelli, Elena; Recchi, Pier Francesco; Fagnano, Massimo; di Perta, Ester Scotto; Pindozzi, Stefania] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy; [Cervelli, Elena; Fagnano, Massimo; Pindozzi, Stefania] Univ Naples Federico II, Interdept Lab Terr Planning LUPT, Naples, Italy; [Pindozzi, Stefania] Univ Naples Federico II, BAT Ctr Interuniv Ctr Studies Bioinspired Agroenvi, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Cervelli, E (corresponding author), via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy.",elena.cervelli@unina.it; massimo.fagnano@unina.it; esterscottodiperta@unina.it; stefania.pindozzi@unina.it,,,,,,,79,1,1,6,9,,,,0308-521X,1873-2267,,,,MAY,2024,217,,,,,,,,103951,10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103951,,APR 2024,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",,Agriculture,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Starting from the essential requirements of improving the collaborative capacity of pollution control and carbon reduction, based on the whole-process governance perspective of source-process-end-of-pipe, build an evaluation index system, measure the collaborative capacity, quantify the spatial differences, analyze the evolution characteristics, and explore the improvement path. The study found that China's collaborative capacity of pollution control and carbon reduction is characterized by homogeneous agglomeration and unbalanced regional development. Intra-regional differences are the main source of the differences, sorting by contribution is Eastern > Western > Central > Northeast. After taking into account the factors of green transformation of industry, the input of scientific and technological elements, and opening to the outside world, the differences have gradually narrowed. Among them, the green transformation of industry is instrumentally in bridging the gap in eastern, central, and northeastern, the input of scientific and technological elements is instrumentally in bridging the gap between regions and the eastern and northeast, and opening to the outside world is instrumentally in bridging the gap between regions and the western. The scientific measurement and improvement of this capacity will provide the factual basis and path choice for achieving the task goal of significantly improving China's collaborative capacity of pollution control and carbon reduction by 2030, which is of great practical significance for building a higher-quality, more sustainable, and greener pattern of the collaborative capacity of pollution control and carbon reduction.","[Han, Dongri; Diao, Yanxia; Wang, Xinjuan; Wang, Hongyu] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yingying] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Agr Sage Culture Studies, Weifang 262700, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Weifang University of Science & Technology,"Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Management, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.",handongri@hrbeu.edu.cn; diaokeyan123456@163.com; xinjuanwang@sdut.edu.cn; qingtian629@163.com; 631089256@qq.com,,,Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [ZR2022QG050]; Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences in Shandong Province [2023-zkzd-035],Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences in Shandong Province,"This work was supported by the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2022QG050): Research on Driving Mechanism and Path Selection of Digital Transformation of Energy Enterprises in Shandong Province under the constraint of Dual Carbon Goal, and Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences in Shandong Province (Key project of think tank) (2023-zkzd-035): Research on the leverage and capture mechanism of dynamic ability of green agricultural products production enterprises on supply chain financing performance.",,42,0,0,16,76,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,OCT,2023,30,46,,,,,103179,103197,,10.1007/s11356-023-29272-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-29272-4,,SEP 2023,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We apply cluster analysis to identify social-ecological archetypes of aquaculture development across these indicators. We also calculate the percentage of global aquaculture production within the quartile ranges of 15 indicators of singular relevance for development. This shows how much aquaculture production is taking place in countries performing low or high on key indices. For example, we show that 85% of global aquaculture production is taking place in countries with the highest or high climate risk, 74% in countries with the lowest or low environmental performance scores, and 90% in countries with the highest or high food supply variability. Our cluster analysis identifies four distinct archetypes driven by the 42 country-level indicators, which includes: climate risk, inland water area, coastal population, seafood consumption, trade balance, governance indices and environmental performance. We characterize the four archetypes as: Archetype 1Emerging aquaculture producers, Archetype 2- Limited aquatic food engagement, Archetype 3- Developing economy aquaculture producers, Archetype 4- Wealthy economy aquaculture producers. We discuss this complexity of factors driving each archetype with country specific examples, as well as the utility of integrated social-ecological analysis for both continued aquaculture research and development practice.","[Partelow, Stefan; Nagel, Ben] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Partelow, Stefan] Univ Bonn, Ctr Life Ethics, Bonn, Germany; [Nagel, Ben] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany; [Gentry, Rebecca] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL USA; [Gentry, Rebecca] Nat Resource Assessors, Auckland, New Zealand; [Gephart, Jessica] Amer Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Rocha, Juan] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Leibniz Association; Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); University of Bonn; Constructor University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; American University; Stockholm University,"Partelow, S (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Life Ethics, Bonn, Germany.",stefan.partelow@uni-bonn.de; ben.nagel@leibniz-zmt.de; rrgentry@fsu.edu; jgephart@american.edu; juan.rocha@su.se,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [031B0785]; Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT),"We acknowledge funding support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Grant/Award Number: 031B0785, within the frame of the COMPASS: Comparing Aquaculture System Sustainability project.

This paper analyzes how port authorities, via the design and implementation of concession agreements, can contribute to a further greening of port management. The paper presents a typology of green instruments applicable to a terminal concession setting. The instruments are evaluated on overall feasibility and suitability in a concession context, but also on more specific criteria related to implementation issues, contribution to green strategies, and targets of port authorities and regulatory/enforcement aspects. The evaluation matrix is based on the output of a structured workshop with port managers and concession experts in a sample of European ports. We demonstrate that a variety of regulatory, investment, and pricing measures are available to port authorities to include green targets in terminal concession agreements. Not all instruments have the same likeliness of being embraced or implemented by port authorities, in part because of a low perceived contribution, high associated regulation costs, or simply because the port authority is unlikely to have jurisdiction in that specific area. Measures related to information reporting and some types of harm-based standards, design standards, and technology specifications are relatively easy to implement in a concession setting. The results also show that many of the measures with a higher expected contribution to innovation and environmental objectives are typically also the ones with higher regulation costs, which might post a higher complexity in terms of their implementation in a concession setting. We further argue that initiatives toward the greening of concession procedures can only reap full benefits if these actions are embedded in a chain approach toward the environment (ship, port, terminal, warehouse, and inland transport).","[Notteboom, Theo] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, CEMIL, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Notteboom, Theo] Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Notteboom, Theo] Univ Ghent, Fac Law & Criminol, Maritime Inst, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Notteboom, Theo] Antwerp Maritime Acad, B-2030 Antwerp, Belgium; [Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Shanghai Maritime University; University of Antwerp; Ghent University; Nanyang Technological University,"Notteboom, T (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, CEMIL, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.;Notteboom, T (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Business & Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.;Notteboom, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Law & Criminol, Maritime Inst, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Notteboom, T (corresponding author), Antwerp Maritime Acad, B-2030 Antwerp, Belgium.",theo.notteboom@gmail.com; sllam@ntu.edu.sg,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project [895-2017-1003],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project,This research was partly supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project (No. 895-2017-1003) on Green Shipping: Governance and Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain.,,42,30,32,2,25,,,,,2071-1050,,,,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,3318,10.3390/su10093318,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10093318,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been used as a tool to assess and improve water use efficiency and water resources management, as well as inform on potential environmental impacts of water consumption in products. This paper is a contribution towards harmonizing WF assessments within decision-making contexts as they relate to their specific focus on either products or water management. First, we describe the relationship between product- and water management-focused WF approaches and their distinct perspectives, priorities and reliance on specific academic fields in relation to water resources decision-making. We then propose a harmonized WF assessment that observes both hydrogeographic and product system boundaries. We apply this harmonized WF assessment to the case of soybean production in Mato Grosso, Brazil, to illustrate how micro- and macro-level decision-making can be combined for a more complete set of policy responses affecting water resources. Our contribution aims to better highlight the strengths and limitations of individual WF approaches and assessments which can be overcome by a harmonized approach. By focusing the conversation on a more integrated assessment of water use in relation to decision-making, we show the range of different purposes and useful WF results that, together, can promote responses for greater local and global water security.","[Lathuilliere, Michael J.] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lathuilliere, Michael J.; Johnson, Mark S.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainabil, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bulle, Cecile] ESG UQAM, CIRAIG, Dept Strategy & Corp Social Responsibil, Montreal, PQ H3C 3E8, Canada; [Johnson, Mark S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",Stockholm Environment Institute; University of British Columbia; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University of British Columbia,"Lathuillière, MJ (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",michael.lathuilliere@sei.org,,,Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) [201411DVC-347484-257696]; Belmont Forum; G8 Research Councils Freshwater Security Grant through NSERC [G8PJ-437376-2012],Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); Belmont Forum; G8 Research Councils Freshwater Security Grant through NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),Funding for this research was provided by the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(#201411DVC-347484-257696) to MJL.

Evolving energy generation and the expansion of the renewable energy capacity and associated infrastructure contribute to changing and increasing demands for minerals and metals. The potential negative environmental, social and economic impacts of increased mineral resource production have been contested and are under increasing scrutiny by both academia and civil society. Responsible Sourcing (RS) has become a management approach for companies and policymakers to identify, monitor and address potential negative impacts along their raw materials' supply chains. Although RS might contribute to sustainability along the supply chain, this paper raises the question of whether it also contributes to Natural Resource Justice (NRJ) in energy transitions. Based on a bibliometric network analysis, this study investigated current narratives of RS literature and to what degree core aspects of NRJ (e.g., distribution of benefits and burdens, power asymmetries, property rights) are reflected in the RS debate following a deductive approach. The results obtained show that compared with other sectors (e.g., timber, food, biomass, textiles) debates on RS in renewable energy-related sectors are still scarce and fragmented. The analysis indicates that different foci are aligned with one or more of the traditional three sustainability dimensions (i.e., environmental, social, economic), while few addressed aspects of NRJ. The authors observed a distinct lack of holistic justice considerations in the current RS debate and only a few individual issues are discussed, such as the detection of burden shifting, accountability for supplier behavior, and sharing of financial benefits. This research contributes to the understanding of different RS ap-proaches and extends the RS discussion to NRJ considerations in energy transitions. It also points out important paths for future research to contribute to just energy transitions.","[Kuegerl, Marie-Theres] Univ Leoben, Chair Min Engn & Mineral Econ, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Hitch, Michael] Curtin Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Gugerell, Katharina] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Landscape Planning, Dept Landscape Spatial and Infrastruct Sci, Peter Jordan Str 65, A-1180 Vienna, Austria",University of Leoben; Curtin University; BOKU University,"Kügerl, MT (corresponding author), Univ Leoben, Chair Min Engn & Mineral Econ, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",marie-theres.kuegerl@unileoben.ac.at; michael.hitch@curtin.edu.au; katharina.gugerell@boku.ac.at,,,European Union [869276],European Union(European Union (EU)),This publication includes research related to the RESOURCING project that received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [grant agreement number 869276] .

In China, the green building (GB) design and planning criteria are generally reflected in state-led evaluation standards. However, there has been a lack of research about the extent to which developers' responses will influence the implementation of the criteria. This study puts the government-made standards into the research framework of GB performance assessment and analyses the rationality of the five major performance indicator system: safety and durability, healthy and comfortable, convenience of living, resource saving and environment livability. The empirical results reveal that the evaluation standard requirements have had different degrees of influence on the selection and application of green technologies. In general, developers chose to invest more in the healthy and comfortable and environmentally friendly indicator systems compared with the convenience of living and resource saving indicator systems due to the costs involved and supply chain and market acceptance issues. This study provides a rare perspective on the GB evaluation standard reflection within the practical building sector. It also contributes to the knowledge of GB assessment and environmental governance in non-liberal contexts.","[Jiang, Han; Xi, Jiaoru] Nanjing Tech Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Miaosen] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Govt Audit, 86 Yushan West Rd,Jiangpu St, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing Tech University; Nanjing Audit University,"Ma, MS (corresponding author), Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Govt Audit, 86 Yushan West Rd,Jiangpu St, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",mamiaosen223@163.com,,,Jiangsu Higher Education Institution Philosophy and Social Sciences General Project [2023SJYB0210]; Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [23KJB560016]; Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China Planning Fund [23KBJ630009],Jiangsu Higher Education Institution Philosophy and Social Sciences General Project; Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China Planning Fund,"This work was supported by Jiangsu Higher Education Institution Philosophy and Social Sciences General Project [grant number 2023SJYB0210], Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [grant number 23KJB560016], and Jiangsu Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China Planning Fund [grant number 23KBJ630009].",,57,0,0,5,5,,,,1543-5075,1543-5083,,,,2025 FEB 19,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/15435075.2025.2460059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2025.2460059,,FEB 2025,,Thermodynamics; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,Thermodynamics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this research was to fill this gap by empirically analysing whether the cultural environment plays a moderator role in the drivers that encourage environmental practices in manufacturing plants, as well as in the relationship between environmental practices and financial performance. The theoretical arguments of Institutional Theory, and Trade-Off and Eco-Efficient Theories, provided the framework in which the hypotheses were tested. The sample was composed of 230 manufacturing plants from ten countries, whose managers answered an environmental questionnaire developed as part of the High Performance Manufacturing Project. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique was used to carry out the research. Results revealed that the factors that most influenced environmental practices adoption in manufacturing plants differed in the considered cultural environments: rule-vs. relation-Based. Cost Savings were the main environmental practices driver in plants in the most advanced rule-based countries, while Top Management support was revealed to be the main motivation in plants in relation-based countries. In addition, it seemed that environmentally-friendly actions had no significant impact on perceived manufacturing company performance, regardless of the cultural environment considered.

Several unique features of this system make it quite different from traditional environmental regulations and thus draw our attention to its effect in combating water pollution. Using a generalized difference-in-differences strategy based on a rich firm-level data set, we find that this policy reduces firms' water pollution by 20%. The reduction can be explained by firms' increase in adopting abatement technologies, improvement in water-related usage efficiency, and changes along both the intensive and extensive margins. The tightened regulation reduces firms' output while induces polluting firms to exit or impede their entry to regulated markets. In addition, heterogeneity analyses indicate that the River Chief System has a stronger effect on polluting industries, state-owned enterprises, large-scale firms, and firms located in areas governed by government officials with higher political incentives.","[Wang, Huanhuan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Law, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Jiaxin] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Fudan University,"Wang, HH (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Law, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",hhwang@law.ecnu.edu.cn; jxxiong20@fudan.edu.cn,,,Humanity and Social Science Interdisciplinarily Innovative Youth Group Fund (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities) of East China Normal University [2021QKT002]; Innovative Research Groups Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [72121002],Humanity and Social Science Interdisciplinarily Innovative Youth Group Fund (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities) of East China Normal University; Innovative Research Groups Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),* Huanhuan Wang acknowledge financial support by Humanity and Social Science Interdisciplinarily Innovative Youth Group Fund (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities) of East China Normal University (2021QKT002) .

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms, we discover a significantly negative nexus between corporate ESG decoupling and customer stability. Mechanism tests reveal that ESG decoupling reduces customer stability by damaging corporate reputation and increasing information asymmetry. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrate that ESG decoupling's adverse influence on customer stability is more prominent in state-owned companies, non-high-tech firms, and firms with fiercer industry competition. Our results show that customers, as corporate primary stakeholders, punish suppliers' ESG decoupling behaviour. This paper enriches the emerging literature on the consequences of ESG decoupling. Meanwhile, our findings offer implications for firms to maintain supply chain security and stability.","[Chen, Xiangyu; Wang, Qi] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wan, Peng] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Accounting, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Wan, P (corresponding author), Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Accounting, 18 Xuezheng St, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",wanpeng@zjsu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [23BGL101],National Social Science Fund of China,The work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China [23BGL101].,,62,0,0,85,123,,,,0003-6846,1466-4283,,,,2024 AUG 7,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00036846.2024.2385756,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2024.2385756,,AUG 2024,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the current echelon utilization system for retired batteries remains immature, exposing numerous issues in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. This paper seeks to enhance and regulate ESG issues throughout the lifecycle of EV batteries and explore the balanced decisions of battery manufacturers (BMs) and electric vehicle manufacturers (EVMs) in a supply chain. Using the Stackelberg game model, we explore ESGrelated cost-sharing contracts across three distinct supply chain models, influenced by BM's ESG improvements and EVM's due diligence efforts. Our analysis reveals that prioritizing ESG considerations enhances mutual benefits, with centralized systems consistently outperforming decentralized ones. Notably, as consumer sensitivity to recycling prices increases, BMs tend to lower their recycling prices, which can reduce battery recycling rates and hinder the sustainable development of the closed-loop battery supply chain. To better align the interests of supply chain members, we propose a two-way cost-sharing contract, with EVMs favoring moderate arrangements to avoid profit loss for both parties. This paper contributes to a more responsible, transparent, and sustainable battery recycling system by integrating ESG improvements and due diligence into the closed-loop supply chain for EV waste batteries.","[Zhao, Senlin; Han, Yue] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Qin] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Dept Decis Analyt & Risk, Southampton, England; [Xia, Xiqiang] Zhengzhou Univ, Business Sch, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Solent University; University of Southampton; Zhengzhou University,"Zhou, Q (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Dept Decis Analyt & Risk, Southampton, England.;Xia, XQ (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Business Sch, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",slzhao@shmtu.edu.cn; 202330710071@stu.shmtu.edu.cn; Q.Zhou@soton.ac.uk; xqxia@zzu.edu.cn,,,"Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China [72472142, 72072111, 72472096]",Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors sincerely thank the Guest Editor, the Handling Co-Editor-in-Chief, and the three reviewers for their constructive and insightful comments during the review process, which have significantly enhanced the quality of this paper.

The green development of industrial enterprises has received widespread attention from researchers. However, existing research lacks the tools to scientifically measure the green development behavior and performance of industrial enterprises. According to the theory of green development behavior and performance of industrial enterprises (GDBP-IE), the aim of this paper is to provide a tool for scientifically measuring such behavior and performance. This paper determined the initial scale through literature analysis and expert discussions and obtained valid samples from 31 provincial administrative regions in China through field and online surveys (N = 853). The exploratory factor analysis method was used to test the reliability and validity of the scale. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The reliability and validity of the GDBP-IE scale are good; (2) the GDBP-IE scale, with a total of 70 items, comprises four sub-scales: The internal factors sub-scale, the external factors sub-scale, the green development behavior of industrial enterprises sub-scale, and the green development performance of industrial enterprises sub-scale. Among them, the internal factors sub-scale, with a total of 13 items, consists of two dimensions: Corporate tangible resources and corporate intangible resources. The external factors sub-scale, with a total of 23 items, consists of three dimensions: Market environment; public supervision; policy and institutional environment. The green development behavior of industrial enterprises sub-scale, with a total of 18 items, consists of two dimensions: Clean production behavior and green supply chain management practice. The green development performance of industrial enterprises sub-scale, with a total of 16 items, comprises three dimensions: Corporate social performance, corporate financial performance, and corporate environmental performance. The findings enrich the research on corporate organizational behavior, green behavior, and green development system theory, and provide tools for further empirical testing. The development and verification of green development behavior and performance of industrial enterprises can help guide various types of industrial enterprises in transforming to green development and can provide a reference for the government to formulate targeted green development policies.","[Li, Xingwei; Du, Jianguo] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Long, Hongyu] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University; Southwest Petroleum University,"Du, JG (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",2111710001@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; djg@ujs.edu.cn; 201821000820@stu.swpu.edu.cn,,,Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China [18VSJ038],Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China,"This research was funded by Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 18VSJ038.",,87,47,47,7,111,,,,,1660-4601,,,,MAR,2020,17,5,,,,,,,1716,10.3390/ijerph17051716,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051716,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,"gold, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It also investigates the relationships between the extent of environmental and social sustainability disclosure of these firms and their actual financial performance.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopted an inductive case study approach for an in-depth investigation of the relationships among concepts. A content analysis of the firms' sustainability reports was performed to determine their pattern and extent of sustainability disclosure against the GRI framework. A disclosure-performance analysis (DPA) matrix was employed to relate the extent of environmental and social sustainability disclosure of these 10 firms with their actual financial performance (i.e. return on assets [ROA] and total revenue growth).FindingsThis study found that the extent of sustainability reporting was relatively high on the labour practices and decent work subgroup, followed by the environmental dimension of the GRI-G4 framework. However, it was relatively low on the society, human rights and product responsibility subgroups of the GRI framework. The DPA revealed that Leaders (firms with higher sustainability disclosure levels) achieved significantly higher ROA. However, Opportunists (firms with lower sustainability disclosure levels) achieved higher levels of financial returns (i.e. ROA and total revenue growth) with less attention to sustainability issues, which contradicts the win-win view of the sustainability disclosure-financial performance relationship.Originality/valueFirst, this study contributes an in-depth review of sustainability disclosure practices of top logistics firms operating in Australia. Second, using DPA, it identifies the novel effects of environmental and social sustainability disclosure levels on these firms' financial performance. It also sheds further light on the potential effect of investments beyond substantial profitability for sustainability growth and corporate governance on the sustainability disclosure-financial performance relationship.","[Jadhav, Akshay; Rahman, Shams; Ahsan, Kamrul] RMIT Univ, Coll Business & Law, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Dept Supply Chain & Logist, Melbourne, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Rahman, S (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Coll Business & Law, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Dept Supply Chain & Logist, Melbourne, Australia.",akshay.yadhav@rmit.edu.au; shams.rahman@rmit.edu.au; kamrul.ahsan@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,104,5,5,4,33,,,,0957-4093,1758-6550,,,,DEC 1,2022,33,5,,,,,244,277,,10.1108/IJLM-09-2021-0452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-09-2021-0452,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effective indicators can help to identify and quantify the sustainability attributes of bioenergy options. We identify 16 socioeconomic indicators that fall into the categories of social well-being, energy security, trade, profitability, resource conservation, and social acceptability. The suite of indicators is predicated on the existence of basic institutional frameworks to provide governance, legal, regulatory and enforcement services. Indicators were selected to be practical, sensitive to stresses, unambiguous, anticipatory, predictive, estimable with known variability, and sufficient when considered collectively. The utility of each indicator, methods for its measurement, and applications appropriate for the context of particular bioenergy systems are described along with future research needs. Together, this suite of indicators is hypothesized to reflect major socioeconomic effects of the full supply chain for bioenergy, including feedstock production and logistics, conversion to biofuels, biofuel logistics and biofuel end uses. Ten indicators are highlighted as a minimum set of practical measures of socioeconomic aspects of bioenergy sustainability. Coupled with locally prioritized environmental indicators, we propose that these socioeconomic indicators can provide a basis to quantify and evaluate sustainability of bioenergy systems across many regions in which they will be deployed.

This paper delves into how blockchain adoption influences financing constraints, considering the moderating effects of environmental and firm-specific factors. Utilizing panel data from A-share listed firms in China over the period 2016-2021, our analysis reveals that blockchain adoption notably eases financing constraints. Additionally, we observe a spillover effect: the adoption of blockchain technology by a central enterprise can alleviate financing constraints for affiliated companies within their supply chain, including upstream and downstream firms. Our heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effectiveness of blockchain in reducing financing constraints is more pronounced in environments with robust internal and external governance and higher levels of marketization. Moreover, blockchain adoption can mitigate traditional finance's ownership bias against non-state-owned enterprises and the bargaining power disparities faced by central firms in the supply chain. In addition, in non-high-tech, non-heavy pollution, and non-manufacturing industries, firms can better alleviate financing constraints after adopting blockchain. These findings offer valuable insights for businesses looking to navigate the challenges and opportunities of mitigating financing constraints through blockchain adoption.","[Li, Dengjia; Ma, Chaoqun; Yang, Jinglan] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Li, Dengjia; Ma, Chaoqun; Yang, Jinglan] Hunan Univ, Res Inst Digital Soc & Blockchain, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Li, Dengjia; Ma, Chaoqun; Yang, Jinglan] Hunan Univ, Key Lab Highperformance Distributed Ledger Technol, Minist Educ, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Li, Hao] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Hunan University; Hunan University; Hunan University,"Yang, JL (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.",lidengjia@hnu.edu.cn; cqunma1998@163.com; lihao@hnu.edu.cn; jlyang@hnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71850012, 71790593]; National Social Science Fund of China [19AZD014]; Major special Projects of the Department of Science and Technology of Hunan Province [2018GK1020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund of China; Major special Projects of the Department of Science and Technology of Hunan Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71850012, 71790593] , the National Social Science Fund of China [grant number 19AZD014] , the major special Projects of the Department of Science and Technology of Hunan Province [grant number 2018GK1020] .",,56,4,4,29,29,,,,1059-0560,1873-8036,,,,NOV,2024,96,,B,,,,,,103672,10.1016/j.iref.2024.103672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2024.103672,,OCT 2024,,"Business, Finance; Economics",,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This certification is currently considered the most important in the field of corporate social responsibility (CSR). After approximately 15 years of research on SA8000, we provide the first literature review on this topic. We analyze 56 scientific papers that address key issues concerning SA8000, including the advantages of the adoption of the ethical certification and the obstacles to adoption and management, and provide a comparison with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards and with other CSR standards and codes of conduct. Papers are coded following a deductive inductive approach, and classified by year of publication, publication outlet, research focus, methodology, underpinning theory (if any), unit of analysis, sample size, industry, and country. Building on literature findings, we identify various research gaps, stemming from the scarcity of empirical research and the weakness of theoretical foundations. In particular, we highlight the lack of evidence on the impact of organizational-level factors on the adoption of the standard, on the extent of the trade-off (if any) between positive and negative outcomes of SA8000, and the failure to identify moderators of the relation between antecedents and SA8000 adoption and/or between adoption and outcomes. Finally, we propose a theory-based research agenda on SA8000 for OM scholars, based on Transaction Cost Economics, Agency, and Neo-Institutional theories and focused on three classes of relevant problems: governance structure under SA8000, risk sharing between buyers and suppliers, and effects on operational performance.

An empirical study on Mexican SMEs,PLOS ONE,,,,Article,,,,,,,STAKEHOLDERS; INDEXES; TESTS,"Companies are increasingly aware of their role with regard to social responsibility in its three pillars: economic, social and environmental, with their different stakeholders. Facing the dilemma of choosing the model of social responsibility they should adopt, taking care of their organizational culture and their employees, with a global vision that the business world requires. However, it is not an easy task for small and medium enterprises, mainly because of their economic shortcomings in human resources and knowledge of how to be a socially responsible company. But they are aware that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an opportunity for development and differentiation in the market. Therefore, the objective of this research is to build, identify and validate a model of Social Responsibility in small and medium enterprises in Guanajuato, Mexico (CSRSMEs), on a sample of 226 SMEs, using as a basis the methodology of the international standard of Ethical and Socially Responsible Management System (SGE21). A quantitative approach was used and, a descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis and the structural equation modeling was applied. The results determine that the most relevant variables for being socially responsible are human capital, clients, supply chain, social environment and impact on the community, and organizational governance: Legality and Management System. It is drawn from this work that the flexibility of the so-called Ethical and Socially Responsible Management System has the empirical foundations needed. That is, from the perspective of the company's management to consider the CSRSMEs model an opportunity to adopt and evaluate the areas of social responsibility management of any business structure in the SMEs in Mexico.","[Rios-Manriquez, Martha] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Finance & Adm, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Gabriela Ferrer-Rios, Martha] Monterrey Inst Technol & Higher Educ, Dept Sci & Engn, Pachuca, Mexico; [Dolores Sanchez-Fernandez, Maria] Univ A Coruna, Dept Business, La Coruna, Spain",Universidad de Guanajuato; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Universidade da Coruna,"Ríos-Manríquez, M (corresponding author), Univ Guanajuato, Dept Finance & Adm, Guanajuato, Mexico.",martha@ugto.mx,,,University of Guanajuato,University of Guanajuato,This study was supported by University of Guanajuato in the form of funds awarded to MRM and used to cover the article publication fee.

This study provides insight into China's water footprint and virtual water trade using three specific water named Green, Blue and Grey. A mull-region input-output analysis at national and sectoral analysis levels from the years 1995 to 2009 is conducted. The evolution and position of China's virtual water trade across a global supply chain are explored through cluster analysis. The results show that China represented 11.2% of the global water footprint in 1995 and 13.6% in 2009. The green virtual water is the largest of China's exports and imports. In general, China is a net exporter of virtual water during this time period. China mainly imports virtual water from the USA, India and Brazil, and mainly exports virtual water to the USA, Japan and Germany. The agriculture sector and the food sector represent the sectors with both the largest import and export virtual water quantities. China's global virtual water trade network has been relatively stable from 1995 to 2009. China has especially close relationships with the USA, Indonesia, India, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. Trade relations, resource endowment and supply-demand relationships may play key roles in China's global virtual water footprint network rather than geographical location. Finally, policy implications are proposed for China's long term sustainable water management and for global supply chain management in general.","[Tian, Xu; Geng, Yong; Qian, Yiying; Xu, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Gao, Cuixia] Jiangsu Univ, Ctr Energy Dev & Environm Protect, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bleischwitz, Raimund] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Xu, Yue] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Jiangsu University; University of London; University College London; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Tian, X (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Sarkis, J (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.;Geng, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",tianxu@sjtu.edu.cn; jsarkis@wpi.edu; ygeng@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71704104, 71690241, 71810107001, 71325006]; Shanghai Municipal Government [17XD1401800]; Yunnan Provincial Research Academy of Environmental Science; Fundamental Research Funds for the China postdoctoral Science Foundation, Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University [16JCCS04]; ESRC [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Government; Yunnan Provincial Research Academy of Environmental Science; Fundamental Research Funds for the China postdoctoral Science Foundation, Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This study is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (71704104, 71690241, 71810107001, and 71325006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the China postdoctoral Science Foundation, Central Universities through Shanghai Jiao Tong University (16JCCS04), the Shanghai Municipal Government (17XD1401800), Yunnan Provincial Research Academy of Environmental Science.

We use corporate social responsibility strategy and policy implementation theories to analyse the processes and conditions for ZDC implementation. We base our study on 35 semi-structured interviews with company representatives and sector actors, publicly available ZDC data, and company reports. The objective is to understand the opportunities and challenges of ZDC implementation at the level of companies. While past research addressed ZDC coverage and effectiveness, knowledge is still lacking on companies' perspectives on the implementation of their commitments. This study provides a unique perspective by integrating the direct experience and knowledge of private actors on an environmental governance regime. We find that companies see implementation of ZDCs as a journey and often rely on voluntary sustainability standards, aligning their strategies and key performance indicators (KPIs) to these. They engage directly in the supply chain, con-ducting projects on-the-ground.  Implementing ZDCs requires the involvement of procurement departments and upper management, and collaborations within and between companies. Companies rely on service providers for in-depth knowledge and field implementation. They use monitoring tools, e.g. remote sensing, and see supply chain traceability as a prerequisite for implementation. Companies face numerous implementation challenges. Internally, companies often lack leadership on their ZDC, struggle to align commitments with the organization's operations and to manage suppliers, especially smallholders, and allocate insufficient resources. Externally, they lack common standards and stakeholder support, and face challenging regulatory conditions and missing market incentives. An uneven playing field creates leakage markets. Companies identify better leadership, technology and pre-competitive collaboration as potential solutions. Zero-deforestation commitments are unlikely to greatly contribute to reducing deforestation until better implementation processes, mechanisms, and conditions are in place.","[Bager, Simon L.; Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Sci, Earth & Life Inst ELI, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, 3 Pl Louis Pasteur, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth, Energy & Environm Sci & Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; Stanford University,"Bager, SL (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Sci, Earth & Life Inst ELI, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, 3 Pl Louis Pasteur, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",simonbager@gmail.com; eric.lambin@uclouvain.be,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [765408],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(Marie Curie Actions),"An earlier version of this paper was included in the first author's PhD thesis: Bager, S.

Chinese manufacturing firms are focused on because of their significant impact on global climate change and distinctive governance structure. Specifically, we survey 155 highest-level environmental managers (EMs) in these firms who have an ultimate decision-making power on environmental issues, and investigate the antecedents and consequence of their proactive pollution reduction behavior (PPRB). Through identifying the psychological motivation implied in EMs' environmental management behavior, we find that both EMs' role breadth self-efficacy (including in-role self-efficacy and extra-role self-efficacy) and felt responsibility (including felt responsibility establishment and felt responsibility coordination) can improve their PPRB. Further, available resources in firms only positively moderate the impact of extra-role self-efficacy on PPRB, and incentives from external stakeholders only moderate the impact of felt responsibility establishment on PPRB. Our empirical results also confirm that PPRB can improve corporate operational performance, strategic competitiveness, and environmental performance, but a higher level of PPRB's performance comes more from the driving force of PPRB's antecedents rather than PPRB itself.","[Liu, Tiansen] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Liang, Dapeng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yufeng] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Song, Yazhi] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Business, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xinpeng] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tiansen] Room 402,73 Youyi Rd, Harbin 150010, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Liang, Dapeng] 92 West Dazhi St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yufeng] Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Song, Yazhi] 101 Shanghai Rd, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xinpeng] 1800 Lihu Ave, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Harbin Engineering University; Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Birmingham; Jiangsu Normal University; Jiangnan University,"Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",tiansen0328@hotmail.com; liangdapeng0920@163.com; zhangys@bham.ac.uk; 15B910046@hit.edu.cn; xinpeng@jiangnan.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774039],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank the funding sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 71774039].,,125,31,34,3,135,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,JUL 15,2019,242,,,,,,327,342,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.050,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we articulate the implied theory of change (ToC) underpinning the design and operation of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), based on an analysis of the Convention's documented evolution. We use this as a framework to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the Convention, with respect to its stated aims, using a range of theoretical and empirical insights. Although achieving success in various ways, CITES is proving ineffective at deterring illegal and/or unsustainable exploitation of many listed species for international trade, which we attribute to implementation and compliance issues and the Convention's design, including a principal focus on deterrence through state-led law enforcement. Informed by this analysis we develop a modified ToC which could support more effective implementation of CITES. This ToC is intended for application at the species level and incorporates an in-depth examination of the social-ecological systems (SESs) within which species are harvested, used, and traded. This species-system ToC explicitly considers formal and informal institutions, and the use of institutional diagnostics to inform potential revisions to institutional arrangements along supply chains. We argue that taking this approach when considering whether and how to implement trade measures under CITES could enhance the effectiveness of these measures in reducing overexploitation and support legal, traceable, and more ecologically and socially sustainable international trade in wild species. Finally, we highlight the role that CITES could play in the broader global biodiversity governance regime; better alignment with other relevant MEAs could lead to more effective biodiversity conservation overall.","[Challender, Daniel W.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how Industry 4.0 technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Industrial Internet of Things, blockchain, digital twins, big data analytics, advanced robotics, and additive manufacturing, can be leveraged to foster environmentally responsible, socially equitable, and economically viable industrial practices. The study examines the impact of these technologies across diverse industrial sectors and evaluates their effects on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. Specifically, the study identifies the manufacturing processes that most benefit from Industry 4.0, including resource efficiency, waste minimization, and supply chain optimization. It identifies key areas of manufacturing that stand to benefit, such as resource efficiency, waste reduction, and supply chain optimization. The analysis reveals that the enhanced connectivity and real-time data processing capabilities of Industry 4.0 technologies - such as realtime data acquisition, predictive maintenance and closed-loop manufacturing - improve supply chain transparency, enhance operational efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and promote the circular economy leading to positive economic, and environmental outcomes. These advancements drive positive social outcomes, including improved workforce safety, the creation of new skill-based jobs, and more equitable access to digital infrastructure. However, the study also highlights that while these technologies can improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, their widespread implementation may also intensify social challenges, such as job displacement and inequality, and exacerbate environmental trade-offs, particularly in energy consumption. To navigate these complexities, the study proposes an integrative framework that encompasses technological, cultural, and policy dimensions, providing a valuable roadmap for aligning Industry 4.0 advancements with robust governance mechanisms and fostering a culture of sustainability within organizations and society at large.","[Khan, M.

Increasingly severe and compounding natural disasters, conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic have led to recurrent food shortages, price spikes and increased food inequities in recent years, threatening food security. 'Regional food systems' (RFSs), that aim to scale up local food production and increase consumer access to food, present many opportunities for adaptive social and ecological developments. However, appreciation of food system resilience at the regional scale remains fragmented, therefore this research aimed to develop a cohesive synopsis of how resilience is conceptualised and enabled within RFSs. A systematic literature review of 688 articles identified 53 of relevance. Analysis revealed 3 'core constructs' with 15 associated 'key themes'. A total of 130 'regional food system resilience' strategies were synthesised from the literature, along with their documented challenges, opportunities and recommendations. Findings revealed that RFS resilience strategies rely on: 1) robust supply chain networks and relationships that feature implicit and explicit values; and 2) access to infrastructure that supports scaling up. Strategic planning and policy-enabled infrastructure and network development will strengthen RFS resilience, and food policy councils are key facilitators of these developments. Greater policy integration related to land use is needed to ensure farmers can access productive agricultural land now and into the future. This research contributes to a greater understanding of how resilience can be optimised at the regional scale and support decision-making to address food security for acute disasters and long-term climatic changes.","[Keegan, Sheriden; Reis, Kimberley; Roiko, Anne; Desha, Cheryl] Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Brisbane, Australia; [Keegan, Sheriden; Reis, Kimberley; Desha, Cheryl] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Australia; [Roiko, Anne] Griffith Univ, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Brisbane, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Keegan, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Cities Res Inst, Brisbane, Australia.;Keegan, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Brisbane, Australia.",sheriden.keegan@griffithuni.edu.au,,,,,,,123,6,6,26,54,,,,1876-4517,1876-4525,,,,JUN,2024,16,3,,,,,801,825,,10.1007/s12571-023-01418-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-023-01418-9,,DEC 2023,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the industrial sector, mechanisms such as value chains and producer obligations have advanced circular economy practices. However, in the agroforestry sector, open burning of waste remains prevalent, resulting in resource loss and heightened fire risks. This scenario jeopardizes the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability, underscoring the need for legal frameworks to ensure waste recovery. This study proposes a regulatory framework to enhance the circular economy in agroforestry waste management. A benchmarking analysis was conducted to examine waste recovery systems where circular economy principles are successfully implemented. Insights from these systems were integrated with an in-depth assessment of the agroforestry biomass recovery chain to develop actionable regulatory measures. The proposed framework includes measures such as mandatory delivery of biomass, creation of aggregation centers, and incentives for biomass recovery. These measures are tailored to reduce fire risks, improve resource efficiency, and align stakeholders' practices with sustainability goals. Visual tools, including comparative tables and diagrams, illustrate the framework's impact. The study highlights the potential of regulatory interventions to promote agroforestry waste recovery, supporting sustainable development. Future work should focus on pilot implementations to validate the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.","[Bastos, Tiago; Nunes, Leonel J.

Multinationals reshore their subsidiaries when regulations in the host country become too costly or difficult to manage. However, it is unclear whether the positive association between the propensity for reshoring subsidiaries and the host country's regulations applies to all types of subsidiaries (i.e. majority or minority owned) and whether it is moderated by other factors. We suggest that external stakeholders play a crucial role in strengthening the relationship between the decision to reshore and the host country's regulations. Within the context of international business, we examine the reshoring decision of a panel of subsidiaries controlled by UK multinationals located in 39 countries and focus on a specific set of environmental and corporate governance regulations. Our findings suggest that reshoring amongst minority-owned subsidiaries is more likely to happen in countries with weak protection of shareholders and mandatory environmental disclosure. Such a relationship is also strengthened by the presence of external stakeholders, namely, foreign directors sitting on subsidiaries' boards. We contribute to the reshoring literature by showing the role of external stakeholders and the impact of institutions and regulatory requirements on reshoring decisions.","[Sena, Vania] Univ Sheffield, Management Sch, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England; [Kanungo, Rama Prasad] Newcastle Univ London, Business Sch, London E1 7EZ, England; [Ozdemir, Sena] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Yannopoulou, Natalia] Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Patel, Parth] Australian Inst Business, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",University of Sheffield; Lancaster University; Newcastle University - UK; Australian Institute of Business,"Kanungo, RP (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ London, Business Sch, London E1 7EZ, England.",rama.kanungo@ncl.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/W007231/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,103,8,8,9,31,,,,1045-3172,1467-8551,,,,JUL,2023,34,3,,,,,1184,1214,,10.1111/1467-8551.12680,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8551.12680,,NOV 2022,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the data of A-share listed firms in China, this paper manually compiles the detailed information of corporate customers, and explores the relationship between firm's ESG performance and customer stability using a two-way fixed-effects model. The results show that: (1) Firms with ESG advantages can enhance customer stability, and the higher the ESG score, the more significant the improvement in customer stability; (2) The mechanism test indicates that firms' ESG performance improves customer stability by strengthening internal and external regulation as well as enhancing corporate reputation; (3) The heterogeneity analysis indicates that in high governance level and small-sized firms, the effect of firms' ESG performance on customer stability is more significant, and in the ESG sub-test, environmental and social responsibility have a more significant impact on customer stability.

In this study, how tough water sanitation and hygiene (HTIW) framework was adopted to assess the effectiveness of these CR-WSPs, which include four groundwater and six protected springs-based WSSs. Employing the HTIW framework, this study adopted the six key indicators environment, infrastructure, management, community governance and engagement, institutional support, and supply chains to evaluate CR-WSPs effectiveness. The indicators were then assessed using a Likert scale. Resilient schemes are needed to demonstrate a capacity to respond effectively to challenges such as unforeseen extreme events and potential hazards, together with an aptitude for financial management, laboratory maintenance, and social inclusion. Less resilient schemes tend to be those linked to social inclusion or financial issues. Institutional support and supply chain domain scored four and were relatively strong among them. The findings of this study suggest that CR-WSPs can be an important metric tool to assess climate resilience and guide policymakers in low- and middle-income countries.","[Poudel, Moti; Sharma, Subodh; Ghimire, Anish] Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhulikhel 45200, Nepal; [Poudel, Moti; Sharma, Subodh; Baidya, Manish] Kathmandu Univ, Aquat Ecol Ctr, Dhulikhel 45200, Nepal; [Ghimire, Anish; Nijhawan, Anisha] Asian Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Howard, Guy] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst Environm, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, England; [Flint, Adrian] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TU, England",Kathmandu University; Kathmandu University; Asian Institute of Technology; University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Poudel, M (corresponding author), Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhulikhel 45200, Nepal.;Poudel, M (corresponding author), Kathmandu Univ, Aquat Ecol Ctr, Dhulikhel 45200, Nepal.",moti.poudle@gmail.com,,,University of Bristol from the Quality Related Global Challenge Research Fund [2019-5073],University of Bristol from the Quality Related Global Challenge Research Fund,"Funding for this research was secured by the University of Bristol from the Quality Related Global Challenge Research Fund [Grant Number: 2019-5073].

Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative fieldwork in Luang Namtha province, the supply chain of cardamom is identified and the socio-economic opportunities for collectors and growers are examined. Rising demand in neighbouring countries, particularly China, provide sound income opportunities for all actors in the cardamom supply chain. Growing improved varieties has become a boon for farmers endowed with relatively large land areas with suitable agro-ecological conditions. However, land-poor and landless collectors of wild cardamom are facing increasing difficulties due to overharvesting, lower prices offered by middlemen, and the rapid conversion of remaining forests into monoculture plantations, especially rubber, which has reduced the natural habitat of cardamom and other non-timber forest products. The major policy implication is that protecting the remaining natural and secondary forests-for instance through making use of evolving international support mechanisms for community-based forest protection, including REDD-plus-will not only be of benefit for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, but would also enhance the livelihoods of the poorest groups in the uplands of northern Laos.","[Choocharoen, Chalathon; Schneider, Antonia; Georgiadis, Pavlos] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Social Sci, Agr Sect, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Neef, Andreas] Kyoto Univ, Chair Resource Governance & Participatory Dev, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",University Hohenheim; Kyoto University,"Neef, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Chair Resource Governance & Participatory Dev, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",neef.andreas.4n@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,Eiselen Foundation Ulm,Eiselen Foundation Ulm,We thank our research assistant and translator Pakakrong M.

The impacts are reflected in all three pillars of sustainable operations and development that port logistics should pursue. The economic impact is strong and is reflected in the extremely high transport prices, the accessibility of transport, the lengthening of the supply chain, and the reduced liquidity of companies. The social aspect is very important regarding working conditions and workers' roles in ports and logistics service providers (LSPs). The dynamic changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic also have an impact on the environmental aspect. As supply chains are vulnerable, more attention is paid to the components of time, price, and reliability than greener transportation. This study highlights changes in port logistics due to the COVID-19 pandemic in logistics companies in the northern Adriatic region and covers a specific gap in the understanding of the sustainable adaptations of LSPs in their operations within port logistics. The results enrich the scientific field regarding LSPs to work processes, the digitalization of business processes, and the organization of logistics chains. The results can be used to develop new sustainable business models for port logistics and port governance, as some researchers have already called for because port logistics too often pursue the economic goals of the fastest and cheapest logistics process. At the same time, social and environmental aspects are somewhat neglected. The changes are particularly pronounced in critical situations, such as those typical of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted as part of the project about green port development with external research funding.","[Beskovnik, Bojan; Zanne, Marina; Golnar, Marko] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Maritime Studies & Transport, Pot Pomorscakov 4, Portoroz 6321, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Beskovnik, B (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Maritime Studies & Transport, Pot Pomorscakov 4, Portoroz 6321, Slovenia.",bojan.beskovnik@fpp.uni-lj.si,,,National Research Agency and Research Program Group,National Research Agency and Research Program Group,This research was funded by the National Research Agency and Research Program Group.,,49,9,9,8,68,,,,,2077-1312,,,,OCT,2022,10,10,,,,,,,1473,10.3390/jmse10101473,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse10101473,,,,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",,Engineering; Oceanography,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As decertification from SA8000 is an under-researched phenomenon, an exploratory approach based on the analysis of 15 multi-country/industry companies has been adopted. Findings show that firms leave SA8000 for several reasons including the reduction of commercial advantages, paperwork overload, and complexities in orders and suppliers management. Our investigation recognizes decertification drivers that are recurring in other standards as well as new ones specific to SA8000. For what concerns the post-decertification paths, we observe that firms pursue three distinct exit strategies (i.e., adoption of an alternative initiative/standard; no adoption of any alternative social standard/initiative, but still respect some SA8000 requirements; no adoption of any alternative social standard/initiative and stop taking care of SA8000 requirements).","[Marcuzzi, Irene; Sartor, Marco; Nassimbeni, Guido] Univ Udine, Polytech Dept Engn & Architecture, Udine, Italy; [Podrecca, Matteo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Engn, Bolzano, Italy; [Podrecca, Matteo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Engn, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",University of Udine; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Podrecca, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Engn, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",matteo.podrecca@unibz.it,,,Libera Universita di Bolzano,Libera Universita di Bolzano,"Libera Universita di Bolzano, Grant/Award Number: SUSTCOTECHCERT?Call RC 2022",,126,2,2,3,12,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,NOV,2023,30,6,,,,,3140,3158,,10.1002/csr.2543,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2543,,JUN 2023,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In fact, despite increasing interest in research on BOP markets, the effect of environmental orientation on the financial decision-making of small businesses from BOP markets has gone largely unexplored. Using a large multicountry data set from a microlending platform, we investigate how the environmental orientation of BOP businesses impacts their financial decisions related to microlending, which ultimately shapes their economic performance. The results indicate that an environmental orientation necessitates BOP businesses to request a higher level of financial capital and ask for longer time to pay it back. Surprisingly, environmental orientation increases the odds of BOP businesses paying back the borrowed capital. These results show that environmental orientation gives rise to both challenges and opportunities for sustainable development in BOP markets.","[Shevchenko, Anton; Pan, Xiaodan] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, 1450 Rue Guy, Montreal, PQ H3H 1J5, Canada; [Calic, Goran] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; McMaster University,"Shevchenko, A (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, 1450 Rue Guy, Montreal, PQ H3H 1J5, Canada.",anton.shevchenko@concordia.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2017-00610],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 430-2017-00610",,87,8,9,2,30,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,JUL,2020,29,5,,,,,1876,1886,,10.1002/bse.2476,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2476,,JAN 2020,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate that ESG performance has a positive effect on companies' trade credit financing. Mechanism analysis reveals that reducing corporate risk, enhancing product market competitiveness, and improving information disclosure quality are the primary channels through which ESG performance improves trade credit financing. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive impact of ESG performance on trade credit financing is more significant for companies with lower levels of supplier concentration and customer concentration, as well as for companies facing higher levels of financing constraints. Further analysis shows that ESG performance helps companies obtain trade credit from both their suppliers and their customers.

Moreover, no study has discussed the issue based on the sustainability goals of the government in the contexts of economic, environmental, and social aspects considering the selection of the tariff or investment strategy. To fill these gaps, this paper develops a bi-level multi-objective mathematical model incorporating two policies of tariff and investment on production capacity as environmental governance policy in refineries competition. The first level presents government problems under sustainability considerations. In the second level, the competition of bio and oil refineries is formulated using the Cournot competition game model. The transformation method is proposed by applying KKT conditions to obtain the best responses of refineries in the corresponding game. In addition, the revised multi-choice goal programming approach is used to solve proposed multi-objective model. A case study is presented to show the applicability of the model and the sensitivity analysis of the critical parameters is conducted. The findings show that government intervention policies on fuel production and consumption can be positively and directly related to reducing pollution and increasing social welfare.","[Jafarnejad, Elaheh; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan] Islamic Azad Univ, Coll Ind Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Makui, Ahmad] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran 16846113114, Iran; [Aghsami, Amir] K N Toosi Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, POB 15875 4416, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Iran University Science & Technology; K.

Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of Woolworths' comprehensive 2008-2011 sustainability and annual reports examined how this retail chain evaluates and implements its sustainable business practices. Findings - The results indicate that such indicators play a significant role in evaluating and implementing various Woolworths' business practices aimed at sustainability. In addition, Woolworths' comprehensive governance system ensures that its sustainable business practices are implemented and targets achieved. Research limitations/implications - The case study demonstrates that businesses can remain profitable, while at the same time protecting the natural environment and striving for sustainable business practices. Practical implications This example demonstrates how government influence, institutional mechanisms and senior management commitment to a project ultimately has gone some way to minimise barriers to the adoption of sustainable practices. Originality/value - The example provides not only a seed of knowledge for others in retailing, but also guidance to both practice in general and theory in the field of sustainable business practices. It demonstrates how an organization has taken strategic action, extended this beyond the firm's boundaries and into the supply chain. The case study illustrates how one organization can act as the change agent in the network.","[Dos Santos, Maria A.

Calls are being made for smarter and more responsible forms of mining, but questions remain about the socio-economic and environmental impacts of extraction, processing, application, and disposal at multiple scales. The literature has been limited to the technical and cost-benefit dimensions of managing RE global supply chains. This article seeks to expand this focus by developing a typology of displacement that may be used to understand the socio-economic and environmental effects of onshore wind, solar photovoltaics (PV), and lithium-ion batteries.

This study explores the causes and effects of this change in strategies, drawing on semi-structured interviews with Swedish forest companies and industries and European retailers. The results show that public bodies, not the least in the EU, as well as ENGOs, have transformed customer demands, resulting in dual-certification.

The methodology involved a thematic analysis of articles, initially identified through a systematic keyword search and further expanded with a snowball search technique. Thematic insights were classified and mapped against actors operating within the lithium-ion battery value-chain. The research found that drivers for adopting voluntary sustainability initiatives include maintaining market access, and addressing the increased need for frameworks to facilitate communication between companies and local communities.

This situation endangers current and future road public-private partnership (PPP) programs, given their dependence on user fees and/or government availability payments. Accordingly, this study aims to explore recovery measures to address short- and long-term road PPP-related challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, by considering recuperation actions implemented during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). To do so, this research examines the PPP-crisis literature through the lens of social network analysis (SNA) and concepts linked to network modularity and community detection techniques. The analysis focuses on unraveling semantic relationships between PPP-related keywords in order to understand lessons learned from the GFC and to propose suitable remedies for overcoming the consequences of the global economic crisis derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings show that the PPP-crisis literature forms a comprehensive self-contained interwoven network that can be organized into five semantic communities according to concepts related to risk, financing, governance, procurement, and institutional environment. Based on such communities, the analysis suggests five recovery measures and highlights two implementation challenges (i.e., global supply chain disruptions and quantitative easing policies). Future research is required to examine effective ways to apply the proposed PPP remedies in the long-term.

Therefore, this paper draws upon the capability approach to analyze the implications of three governance mechanisms (i.e., third-party, social control, and hybrid certification) on human flourishing within AFNs in Ceara, Brazil. The three cases primarily build on 66 interviews with farmers, consumers, AFN owners and employees, certifying officials, governmental and non-governmental representatives, and researchers. Third-party certification has some positive effects in terms of material, political, and environmental capabilities and many negative effects regarding social/cultural capabilities. Social control certification bolsters material, social/cultural, political, and environmental capabilities for the benefit of farmers and consumers. Hybrid certification increases the material control, political power, social legitimacy, and environmental governance of market intermediaries. The findings can help scholars, practitioners, and policymakers rethink the role of organic standardization and certification in fostering fundamental human capabilities and tackling inequalities within AFNs.","[de Lima, Felipe Alexandre; Seuring, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Supply Chain Management, Kassel, Germany; [de Lima, Felipe Alexandre] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Brussels, Belgium; [Neutzling, Daiane Muelling] Univ Fortaleza, Postgrad Program Business Adm, Fortaleza, Brazil; [Kumar, Vikas] Birmingham City Univ, Fac Business Law & Social Sci, Birmingham, England; [Bossle, Marilia Bonzanini] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Rio Grande IFRS, Viamao, Brazil; [de Lima, Felipe Alexandre] Univ Kassel, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Supply Chain Management, Henschelstr 2, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Solvay SA; Universidade Fortaleza; Birmingham City University; Universitat Kassel,"de Lima, FA (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Supply Chain Management, Henschelstr 2, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",felipelima@uni-kassel.de,,,Newton Mobility Grants [NG160177]; Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; British Academy [NG160177] Funding Source: British Academy,Newton Mobility Grants; Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (FUNCAP)); British Academy(British Academy),"Fundacao Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Newton Mobility Grants 2016, Grant/ Award Number: NG160177",,71,2,2,4,18,,,,2694-6416,2694-6424,,,,OCT,2023,32,4,,,,,1547,1562,,10.1111/beer.12561,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/beer.12561,,JUN 2023,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The slavery and trafficking framings pervading these depictions have been very useful for drawing attention to and acting on criminal activities in labour recruitment and abuse, but have limits as a basis for addressing the underlying causes of forced labour in fisheries. Insights from research on regional labour migration as well as the work of civil society organisations in Thailand suggest that broader improvements in labour relations will require changes in migration management, with a focus on addressing vulnerabilities that restrict the abilities of migrant workers to obtain better working conditions. This analysis provides the basis for assessing the potential and limits of recent programmes to improve labour relations on the oceans, including anti-trafficking policies, IUU enforcement, buyer efforts to ensure that supply chains do not involve forced or illegal labour relations, and Thai government actions.

The study results suggest that an increase in the density of CSR information disclosing enterprises in a region will increase the number of enterprises with disclosure intentions. A density increase has a nonlinear influence on the quality of CSR information disclosure and on corporate performance, where the influence of disclosing enterprises' density on corporate performance is partly mediated by the quality of CSR information disclosure.

This study fills an important gap by analyzing the framework of CSR assessment practices on identification of five criteria and 17 indicators encompassing the strategies of accountability, transparency and compliance of CSR. To achieve the goal of CSR, the strategies have been defined in connection with different literatures and quaternary survey for criteria selection, where the criteria are expressed in a fuzzy horizon. This multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model has been solved using a fuzzy analytical networking process and balanced scorecard (BSC) method to develop selection strategy and criteria for implementation of CSR. The paper's outcomes help administrators of corporate sectors, particularly in developing countries, to follow sustainable actions as CSR providers effectively and to gain a significant reasonable advantage. The findings exposed the CSR assessment structure and interrelationships among BSC perspectives/criteria and indicators on which managers are needed to emphasize to get optimum CSR performance. In this study, the most important strategy and criteria to perform optimum CSR level are as follows: accountability of CSR project is the best strategy; Project team work, incentives, Environmental resources, Communication for motivation, Reporting initiative of stockholders, CSR project with stockholder capital, Strategic governance, Mission sustainability, political role, Human resources, respectively, are criteria.","[Debnath, Animesh] Vivekananda Mahavidyalaya, Dept Econ, Burdwan East 713103, India; [Roy, Jagannath; Chatterje, Kajal; Kart, Samarjit] Natl Inst Technol Durgapur, Dept Math, Burdwan 713209, W Bengal, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Durgapur,"Kart, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Durgapur, Dept Math, Burdwan 713209, W Bengal, India.",animesh2007.1813@rediffmail.com; jaga.math23@gmail.com; chatterjeekajal7@gmail.com; kar_s_k@yahoo.com,,,"Department of Science and Technology, India under INSPIRE Fellowship program [DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2013/544]","Department of Science and Technology, India under INSPIRE Fellowship program(Department of Science & Technology (India)Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Philippines)","The authors are very thankful to the Editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions/criteria remarks to improve the quality of the paper; their help has undoubtedly increased the understanding of the authors on the subject.

This proliferation of international, private governance standards is interacting with domestic, public regulations guiding mining activity in resource rich states. When private and public requirements duplicate, overlap, or diverge they can create inconsistent processes, administrative burden, and dilemmas through a patchwork of basic components in supply chain management (Cashore et al., 2021). Applying a typology of interactions between private authority and public policy to lithium mining in Argentina, we argue that private/public rules are loosely complementary in some respects and independently coexisting in others. Comparing a rigorous private standard, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), to public regulations we find that both include similar provisions for environmental protection and public participation . IRMA provides better protections for indigenous peoples' participation, though it lacks significant enforcement mechanisms. Questions remain over the private sector's ability to guarantee - in practice - the rights of indigenous and other affected communities, or to protect ecosystems in the rush for critical minerals. Resulting governance dilemmas illustrate an increasingly crowded regulatory space in lithium mining that indiscriminately presumes public regulatory gaps, while it privatizes accountability.","[Kramarz, Teresa] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mahiques, Maria Victoria Arias; Allan, Tomas] Fundar, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Escosteguy, Melisa; Seghezzo, Lucas] Univ Salta, Non Convent Energy Res Inst INENCO, Natl Council Sci & Tech Res CONICET, Salta, Argentina; [Kingsbury, Donald] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Kramarz, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,Climate Positive Energy Initiative at the University of Toronto; National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) of Argentina,Climate Positive Energy Initiative at the University of Toronto; National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) of Argentina(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),This project was made possible by a grant from the Climate Positive Energy Initiative at the University of Toronto.

The level of accident rates in the construction industry place OHS issues at the heart of their strategic management. Method: The assessment of OHS issues was made by drawing appropriate data from the Corporate Social Responsibility reports of 19 multinational construction companies published on a voluntary basis. Results: The findings show a low response rate by the companies sampled to the requirements of stakeholders for responsible organizational behavior and accountability for their consequences. Most of the companies sampled have only focused on a small number of OHS issues to assure the transparency of the information published such as OHS governance, accident and illness rates, training hours, third party assurance, and membership of externally developed OHS charters. Similarly, other important OHS issues seem to be less covered by the companies sampled such as the representation of total workforce in OHS committees, the percentage of high risk occupations, and OHS practices in the supply chain.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

By 2030, the EU will need 18 times more lithium, and by 2050, 60 times more. For that reason, Europe aims to increase domestic sourcing and achieve nearly full self-sufficiency by 2030. However, lithium mining has a high environmental footprint and can have severe social impacts. This research examines the socio-environmental implications of lithium mining for the EU energy transition and identifies leverage points that alleviate tension between justice and security. The Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, and Political framework was used to systematically gather insights from experts representing various stakeholders on these issues. Subsequently, these insights were compiled into a fuzzy-cognitive map, creating a system-based overview and allow construction and comparison of four scenarios examining the future of lithium and its impacts on the environment and local communities in Europe. This reveals the importance of good governance to avoid issues of corruption and geopolitical tensions with a potential adverse impact on society and environment. However, governance alone is insufficient to mitigate negative impacts. A circular economy, where lithium is recovered from used batteries, is most favorable, reducing the demand for new material and the negative impacts of mining. This holistic overview stresses the need for increased government involvement, stakeholder alignment, and dealing with corruption as vital aspects in mitigating the negative socio-environmental impacts of lithium mining.","[Wolters, Leander; Brusselaers, Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Wolters, L (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",leander.wolters@amsterdam.nl,,,,,,,116,6,6,17,27,,,,2214-790X,2214-7918,,,,SEP,2024,19,,,,,,,,101498,10.1016/j.exis.2024.101498,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2024.101498,,AUG 2024,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Designing a reasonable supervision mechanism is crucial to correcting market failures. We develop a media supervision mechanism through a StackelbergEvolutionary game model to study the impact of media supervision on the evolutionary behavior of the manufacturer population. Assuming the media is leader, manufacturers' demands are heterogeneous under different strategy profiles after the media determines the effort level of supervision. The best response of the manufacturer population is the evolutionarily stable strategy under supervision, where the percentage of CSR strategies is defined as CSR level. It is proved that the CSR level elevates with the increase of effort level. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg-Evolutionary equilibrium and a numerical algorithm to compute it. The results show that CSR level under Stackelberg-Evolutionary equilibrium is higher than that without supervision. Our research not only illustrates the effectiveness of media supervision in reducing environmental pollution but also provides suggestions for governments to formulate environmental policies and improve regulatory mechanisms.","[Sun, Yanru; Sun, Hao; Sun, Panfei; Jin, Xuanzhu; Yang, Yimei] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Sun, YR (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yrsun@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; hsun@nwpu.edu.cn; sunpanfei@nwpu.edu.cn; xzjin@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; yimeiyang@mail.nwpu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72471187, 72001172]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Acknowledgments This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72471187 and 72001172) .,,63,0,0,61,61,,,,0305-0483,1873-5274,,,,FEB,2025,131,,,,,,,,103215,10.1016/j.omega.2024.103215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2024.103215,,NOV 2024,,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,,Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

MethodsThis study matches the data of the Pollution Information Transparency Index (PITI) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2018 and uses the ordered logistic regression model to assess the impact of environmental information disclosure on the health of middle-aged and old residents. Furthermore, stepwise regression, ordinary least square, and ordered probit regression models are used for robustness tests. The IV-Ordered probit regression model solves the endogenous problem. ResultsEnvironmental information disclosure has a significant positive correlation with the health level of middle-aged and old residents. After the robustness test and endogenous problem handling, this conclusion still holds. Estimation results show that when PITI increases by 1 unit, the probability of improving the self-reported health level and actual health level of middle-aged and old residents increases by 1 and 0.87%, respectively. The impact of environmental information disclosure on the health of middle-aged and old residents also has significant regional heterogeneity. Specifically, the impact is mainly reflected in the central region of China. ConclusionEnvironmental information disclosure can improve the health of middle-aged and old residents. To improve the health of middle-aged and old residents, it is necessary to implement and enhance the environmental information disclosure system continuously. The anti-driving effect of environmental information disclosure on the treatment of environmental pollution must be intensified further, particularly focusing on the central region of China, where is more polluted and more concentrated than other regions.","[Yu, Xuan] Ningbo Univ, Business Sch, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xuan] Ningbo Univ, Donghai Strateg Res Inst, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Shen, Weiteng] Zhejiang Wanli Univ, Business Sch, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Lin, Sen] Ningbo China Inst Supply Chain Innovat, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Lin, Sen] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Ningbo, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Ningbo University; Zhejiang Wanli University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Yu, X (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Business Sch, Ningbo, Peoples R China.;Yu, X (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Donghai Strateg Res Inst, Ningbo, Peoples R China.",yuxuan@nbu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LQ22G030002]; National Social Science Fund of China [19AZD004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874092]; K.C.

Illegalities and loopholes riddle certification in Indonesia and Malaysia, the two main sources of certified palm oil; at the same time, palm oil imports are rising in markets not demanding certification. Across the tropics, oil palm plantations linked to deforestation and human rights abuses are continuing to expand as companies navigate weak governance rules, and as sales shift across markets and inside global supply chains.

Such teleconnections are commonly studied through calculating consumption footprints and quantifying environmental impacts embodied in trade flows, e.g., virtual water and land, biomass, or greenhouse gas emissions. The extent to which land-use change (LUC) and associated carbon emissions are embodied in the production and export of agricultural commodities has been less studied. Here we quantify tropical deforestation area and carbon emissions from LUC induced by the production and the export of four commodities (beef, soybeans, palm oil, and wood products) in seven countries with high deforestation rates (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea). We show that in the period 2000-2011, the production of the four analyzed commodities in our seven case countries was responsible for 40% of total tropical deforestation and resulting carbon losses. Over a third of these impacts was embodied in exports in 2011, up from a fifth in 2000. This trend highlights the growing influence of global markets in deforestation dynamics. Main flows of embodied LUC are Latin American beef and soybean exports to markets in Europe, China, the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and Northern Africa, whereas embodied emission flows are dominated by Southeast Asian exports of palm oil and wood products to consumers in China, India and the rest of Asia, as well as to the European Union. Our findings illustrate the growing role that global consumers play in tropical LUC trajectories and highlight the need for demand-side policies covering whole supply chains. We also discuss the limitations of such demand-side measures and call for a combination of supply- and demand-side policies to effectively limit tropical deforestation, along with research into the interactions of different types of policy interventions.","[Henders, Sabine] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Persson, U.

Over-emphasis on institutional factors leading to adoption of these standards has neglected the role of firms' existing capabilities. External pressures can drive firms to adopt standards more than their technical capacity to employ them. This can lead to problems of fit between institutional requirements and a firm's existing capabilities. We describe a conceptual model that considers the impact of an interaction between a firm's institutional requirements and its existing capabilities on standards failure. We suggest solutions that align institutional requirements to appropriate governance forms as a means to improve standards success. We contribute to theory by describing the role of firms' internal capabilities to the success of voluntary management standards and the reliability of self-regulation generally.","[Simpson, Dayna] Monash Univ, Dept Management, Caulfield, Vic, Australia; [Power, Damien] Univ Melbourne, Dept Management, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Power, Damien] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Klassen, Robert] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Monash University; University of Melbourne; University of Groningen; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University Western Ontario Hospital,"Simpson, D (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Management, Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic, Australia.",Dayna.Simpson@monash.edu; damien@unimelb.edu.au; rklassen@ivey.uwo.ca,,,,,,,81,53,57,3,58,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,SEP,2012,110,1,,,,,85,95,,10.1007/s10551-011-1149-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-011-1149-6,,,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased demand for animal-based protein in particular is expected to have a negative environmental impact, generating greenhouse gas emissions, requiring more water and more land. Addressing this perfect storm will necessitate more sustainable production of existing sources of protein as well as alternative sources for direct human consumption. This paper outlines some potential demand scenarios and provides an overview of selected existing and novel protein sources in terms of their potential to sustainably deliver protein for the future, considering drivers and challenges relating to nutritional, environmental, and technological and market/ consumer domains. It concludes that different factors influence the potential of existing and novel sources. Existing protein sources are primarily hindered by their negative environmental impacts with some concerns around health. However, they offer social and economic benefits, and have a high level of consumer acceptance. Furthermore, recent research emphasizes the role of livestock as part of the solution to greenhouse gas emissions, and indicates that animal-based protein has an important role as part of a sustainable diet and as a contributor to food security. Novel proteins require the development of new value chains, and attention to issues such as production costs, food safety, scalability and consumer acceptance. Furthermore, positive environmental impacts cannot be assumed with novel protein sources and care must be taken to ensure that comparisons between novel and existing protein sources are valid. Greater alignment of political forces, and the involvement of wider stakeholders in a governance role, as well as development/commercialization role, is required to address both sources of protein and ensure food security.","[Henchion, Maeve] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Dept Agri Food Business & Spatial Anal, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland; [Hayes, Maria] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Food BioSci Dept, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland; [Mullen, Anne Maria] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Food Qual & Sensory Sci, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland; [Fenelon, Mark] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Teagasc Food Res Programme, Ashtown & Moorepk, Fermoy P61 C996, Cork, Ireland; [Tiwari, Brijesh] Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Food Chem & Technol Dept, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland",Teagasc; Teagasc; Teagasc; Teagasc; Teagasc,"Henchion, M (corresponding author), Teagasc Food Res Ctr, Dept Agri Food Business & Spatial Anal, Rural Econ & Dev Programme, Dublin D15 KN3K, Ireland.",Maeve.Henchion@teagasc.ie; Maria.Hayes@teagasc.ie; Anne.Mullen@teagasc.ie; Mark.Fenelon@teagasc.ie; Brijesh.Tiwari@teagasc.ie,,,"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) - Irish Government [11/F/043]","Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) - Irish Government","This work forms part of the ReValueProtein Research Project (Exploration of Irish Meat Processing Streams for Recovery of High Value Protein Based Ingredients for Food and Non-food Uses, Grant Award No. 11/F/043) supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) under the National Development Plan2007-2013 funded by the Irish Government.",,98,889,984,46,503,,,,,2304-8158,,,,JUL,2017,6,7,,,,,,,53,10.3390/foods6070053,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods6070053,,,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The board of directors is the main green governance body, and the consciousness and conducts of the green governance of board members are determined by corporate mission. As a result, we explored the mechanism of the impact of board power hierarchy on green governance performance through the influence of green governance conduct. To interpret this mechanism, we introduced relational contract theory and conducted an empirical analysis. The results show that board power hierarchy negatively affects green governance conduct. Corporate mission restrains the board power hierarchy's negative influence on green governance conduct, showing that board power structure has a significantly positive effect on green governance performance through the mediator of green governance conduct.

There is increasing interest in developing U.S. production of cobalt, given that 70 % of mine production is in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 76 % of refinery production is in China, provoking geopolitical, supply chain, and environmental, social, and governance concerns. This paper focuses on the two leading prospective regions for U.S. cobalt production, in Minnesota and Idaho. Our central aim is to understand why reactions to mining proposals have been divergent, with polarized, intractable debates that have stalled projects in Minnesota while proposed mines in Idaho have advanced with minimal controversy. We summarize the geology and mining methods of each project before analyzing similarities and differences in responses, organizing our analysis around facets of environment, identity and legitimacy, politics, and economy. We find that many of the same dynamics are at play, differing in intensity and extent rather than being fundamentally distinct. The sites share many characteristics, including history of mining, proximity to wilderness, and economies rooted in both mining and recreation. Differentiating factors include the proximity of a large urban constituency in Minnesota with no parallel in Idaho, and smaller scale of mining proposals in Idaho.","[Malone, Aaron; Smith, Nicole M.; Holley, Elizabeth A.] Colorado Sch Mines, Min Engn Dept, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Malone, Aaron] Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Publ Policy, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Htun, Tinzar] Colorado Sch Mines, Nat Resources & Energy Policy Program, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines,"Malone, A (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Min Engn Dept, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Malone, A (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Payne Inst Publ Policy, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",amalone@mines.edu,,,NSF Growing Convergence Research [2120721],NSF Growing Convergence Research,The work was funded by NSF Growing Convergence Research award #2120721 as part of the Responsible Critical Elements project.

J,"McDermott, CL",,,,"McDermott, Constance L.",,,Certification and equity: Applying an equity framework to compare certification schemes across product sectors and scales,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,,,,Article,,,,,,Equity; Certification; Forest; Fair trade; Carbon,FAIR TRADE; FOREST CERTIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; MARKET; STANDARDS; COFFEE,"This paper applies a comprehensive equity framework to compare the priorities and tradeoffs of different environmental and social certification schemes. The schemes selected for comparison are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC), the Fairtrade Labelling Organization (FLO), and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA). The framework considers how the parameters of equity are set in certification scheme governance, including who are the primary decision-makers and intended beneficiaries, and how this is reflected in the content of scheme standards and certification outcomes. Each of these parameters is assessed across the dimensions of procedural, contextual and distributive equity. Results reveal significant variation in the prioritization of the environment, non-commercial stakeholders or equity across the supply chain. In forestry, the FSC has placed primary emphasis on the procedural rights of non-commercial interests in standard-setting processes, the contextual rights of indigenous peoples, and the conservation of natural ecosystems, while the PEFC places more emphasis on procedural equity for producers and the legitimacy of sovereign governments as rule-makers. Both FLO and CCBA prioritize distributive equity regarding the sharing of material benefits with small-scale and/or community producers or workers, while FLO also emphasizes the contextual issue of empowerment and capacity-building. In all schemes, contextual factors related to capacity and access have disproportionately advantaged Northern and large-scale corporate actors. Scheme priorities are reflected in scheme standards. Schemes where producers are the primary subjects of equity are less prescriptive about safeguarding non-producer interests. A focus on non-producers, in contrast, leads to more prescriptive requirements to protect the environment and/or other actors not involved in production. Finally, there is a significant gap between the ways that schemes frame equity and the outcomes. Contextual factors such as land and resource ownership, supply chain structures, export dependence and the organizational capacity of different stakeholders play a key role in shaping certification uptake and benefit distribution. Hence, the distribution of certificates largely mirrors existing patterns of global trade. While envirosocial certification has likely increased the overall influence of Northern NGOs relative to industrial producers, the balance of power between these two interest groups has been a constant point of contention. Meanwhile, without further deliberative strategies aimed at addressing contextual barriers to participation, certification is likely to exacerbate inequalities among other stakeholders and regions.

This literature review examines global lithium extraction's environmental and socio-political costs to highlight the tensions between sustainable development and extractive practices in the lithium industry. A comprehensive subset of scholarship reports the degradation of ecosystems, the commodification of Indigenous lands, and the erosion of biodiversity. Scholars have attributed lithium's socio-ecological cost to green extractivism, where the green agenda promotes extractive practices reminiscent of the fossil fuel era. A second strain of literature delves into how lithium is discursively framed and legitimized through 'sociotechnical imaginaries' (STI). Those imaginaries embody how societies collectively envision lithium's role in shaping future socio-political and economic structures, particularly regarding national identity, sovereignty, and sustainable progress. Additionally, these imaginaries highlight the tensions between local communities, national governments, and global stakeholders over extraction's socio-environmental costs. Finally, studies also discuss the geopolitical dimensions of lithium supply chains, particularly the tensions between China and Western economies over control of critical minerals-the fight for geopolitical dominance perpetuates colonial dynamics by both stakeholders. The findings underscore the need for more sustainable extraction policies and equitable governance mechanisms that account for the socio-environmental challenges posed by lithium mining in the context of global climate goals.","[Chaudary, Muhammad Sikandar Ali] Univ Sydney, Sydney Environm Inst, 23 Wenke Cres, Yagoona, NSW 2199, Australia",University of Sydney,"Chaudary, MSA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Environm Inst, 23 Wenke Cres, Yagoona, NSW 2199, Australia.",Sikandar.ch223@gmail.com,,,SSHRC [430719],SSHRC(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was supported by SSHRC grant number 430719.,,101,1,1,14,14,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,MAR,2025,121,,,,,,,,103952,10.1016/j.erss.2025.103952,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.103952,,FEB 2025,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

EEG1's emphasis on environmental imperatives is loosely framed and needs a theoretical socio-economic evolutionary base that is the central thrust of EEG2. Meanwhile EEG2 would be empowered by incorporating environmental concerns within its mandate. Moreover, both EEG1 and EEG2 share common roots in institutional methodologies, emphasize cumulative causation and path-dependent behaviour, have strong interests at regional scales of analysis, and both are intimately tied to the causes and consequences of innovation. This article provides a rationale and suggests an integrative conceptual approach for developing EEG2. In particular, the article outlines a conceptual framework that interprets EEG2 in terms of co-evolutionary socio-ecological and multi-scalar processes that are situated within a reasoned history interpretation of economic development. This framework further highlights the roles of path dependency, innovation, multinational corporations and value chains. How this multi-scalar framework may be elaborated is then discussed around three themes: extending placed-based analysis of localized clusters; broadening the scope of global value chain analysis; and re-engaging the analysis of core-periphery relations. Ultimately the case for EEG2 is to ensure that economic geographic perspectives are fully incorporated in debates over the co-evolution of economy and environment, in research and policy terms one of, if not the, central challenges of development in the 21st century.","[Patchell, Jerry] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hayter, Roger] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Geog, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Simon Fraser University,"Patchell, J (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",sopatch@ust.hk; hayter@sfu.ca,,,,,,,149,35,43,2,76,,,,0435-3684,1468-0467,,,,JUN,2013,95B,2,,,,,111,130,,10.1111/geob.12012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geob.12012,,,,Geography,,Geography,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seafood demand is steadily rising due to growth in the global human population, affluence, and per capita consumption. Seafood supply is also growing, despite declining wild fish stocks, with phenomenal advances in aquaculture, that is, the cultivation of aquatic organisms. Aquaculture supplied 42 % of the world's fish in 2012 and is forecast to eclipse capture fisheries production by 2030. The balance between these two seafood production systems has profound implications for global food security, income distribution, and ecological sustainability. Here, a qualitative analysis of the ethics and sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture is presented. An innovative practical ethics approach is introduced which adapts the ethical matrix, a conceptual tool for analyzing the wellbeing, autonomy, and justice of different interest groups, and Rapfish, a rapid appraisal technique used to evaluate the sustainability of fisheries along six performance modalities, including ethics. Using case studies of global large- and small-scale capture fisheries and generalized carnivorous and omnivorous aquaculture systems, I show that human institutions and social actors interact in complex governance processes to influence seafood ethics and sustainability.","[Lam, Mimi E.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Lam, Mimi E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 2207 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Lam, ME (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;Lam, ME (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 2207 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",mimibethlam@gmail.com,,,,,,,140,22,24,4,112,,,,1187-7863,1573-322X,,,,FEB,2016,29,1,,,SI,,35,65,,10.1007/s10806-015-9587-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-015-9587-2,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Ethics; Environmental Sciences; History & Philosophy Of Science",,Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; History & Philosophy of Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

As one of the largest carbon emitters, China has launched a series of policies to achieve carbon peaking and neutrality collectively referred to as China's dual carbon policy. However, existing research on the impact of China's dual carbon policy on green innovation by heavy-polluting enterprises is insufficient. To fill this gap, this study constructed a theoretical model to draw hypotheses about the impact of the dual carbon policy on enterprises' green innovation and verified this impact using a difference-in-differences model to conduct a quasi-natural experiment based on data from 2010 to 2022 from Chinese A-share-listed enterprises. The results indicate that the dual carbon policy had a significantly positive influence on green innovation in heavy-polluting enterprises. Moreover, environmental tax mediated this effect, while enterprises' total costs and subsidies positively moderated it. Additionally, the impact exhibited variations based on several key factors, including green patent type, carbon emissions, enterprise ownership structure, and Environmental, Social, and Governance ratings.

This study explores the effects of ESG on systemic tail risk. This study finds that ESG can significantly decrease the level of corporate systemic tail risk. The heterogeneity analysis shows that the restraining impact is more obvious in non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises with higher financing constraints, and industries with lower levels of competition. Additionally, this study discuss the channel mechanism of ESG on systemic tail risk in enterprises from both internal and external perspectives.

They primarily aim at enhancing the sustainability of agricultural production processes. The global palm oil supply, the different environmental and social problems related to it, and the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification clearly illustrate this. However, global sustainability standards may also have unintended impacts on food security and local development, which are not explicitly taken into account. This article explores the unnoticed effects of voluntary palm oil certification in Indonesia and Ghana and identifies their implications on local and national food provision. As voluntary labels and certification schemes are an emerging category of global governance instruments, their role in food security, as a global public good, should be taken seriously and connected to political and scientific debates on their future involvement in realizing food security.

Using an augmented Chinese input-output table in which information about firm ownership and type of traded goods are explicitly reported, we show that ignoring firm heterogeneity causes embodied CO2 emissions in Chinese exports to be overestimated by 20% at the national level, with huge differences at the sector level, for 2007. This is because different types of firms that are allocated to the same sector of the conventional Chinese input-output table vary greatly in terms of market share, production technology and carbon intensity. This overestimation of export-related carbon emissions would be even higher if it were not for the fact that 80% of CO2 emissions embodied in exports of foreign-owned firms are, in fact, emitted by Chinese-owned firms upstream in the supply chain. The main reason is that the largest CO2 emitter, the electricity sector located upstream in Chinese domestic supply chains, is strongly dominated by Chinese-owned firms with very high carbon intensity.

Both critics and proponents of corporate social responsibility (CSR) interpret this as a necessary but uncertain development. Business response has demonstrably failed in the past. Contributing to the CSR and private environmental governance effectiveness literature, this article argues that while voluntary corporate climate governance efforts are essential and improving, they are far from sufficient for meaningful decarbonization. Through an evaluation of the three main underlying corporate carbon management practices (target setting, carbon pricing and carbon reporting), the article highlights how company efforts create business advantage (e.g. risk management) but fall short on ecological effectiveness (i.e. absolute carbon reduction). In response, the paper argues the importance of greater climate policy co-regulation. This includes indirect enabling by governments and the IPCC to encourage incremental improvements in company efforts. It also includes more direct, state-led prescriptive interventions coordinated across supply chains and supported by international organizations, to ensure corporate participation and deeper transformative change to business models, industry structures and consumptive patterns at the root of the global climate crisis.","[Lister, Jane] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Ctr Transportat Studies, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Lister, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Ctr Transportat Studies, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [857-2007-0022],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The author wishes to thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (grant: 857-2007-0022]; Jocelyn Fraser for valuable insights and research assistance; and Charlie Roger and David Held for very generous feedback and helpful guidance.,,73,25,25,3,39,,,,1758-5880,1758-5899,,,,NOV,2018,9,4,,,,,538,548,,10.1111/1758-5899.12618,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12618,,,,International Relations; Political Science,,International Relations; Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research focuses on how IoT enhances Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices within organizations, addressing key sustainability challenges and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study identifies three primary findings: (1) IoT applications directly enhance power source management in the environmental domain, improving Business Strategy and Long-term Growth (BSLG) and Measurement and Reporting (M&R) capabilities. This is achieved through real-time monitoring, smart building management, and predictive maintenance. In the social sphere, IoT strengthens supply chain transparency, bolstering Stakeholder Management (SM) through real-time tracking and blockchain-integrated systems for product authenticity verification. IoT comprehensively empowers performing risk management in the governance realm, improving Organizational Culture (OC) through early warning systems and predictive analytics for risk mitigation. (2) IoT integration facilitates Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM), Real-Time Responsiveness (RTR), and Business Risk Management (BRM), key components of IoT-DMC. Furthermore, it supports the development of Effective Stakeholder Management (ESM), Resource Efficiency (RE), and Sustainable Competitive Outcomes (SCO) within IoT-CSL. (3) While highlighting the potential of IoT in advancing CSL, the research also acknowledges challenges such as initial investment costs, data privacy concerns, technological complexity, energy consumption of IoT devices, and electronic waste management. The study concludes that successful IoT implementation in CSL requires careful planning, robust data management, and a holistic approach considering both benefits and potential drawbacks.","[Hsieh, Ming Yuan] Natl Taichung Univ Educ, Dept Int Business, Taichung 403454, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Ming Yuan] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Coll Sustainabil & Green Energy, Taoyuan City 320317, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Education; National Central University,"Hsieh, MY (corresponding author), Natl Taichung Univ Educ, Dept Int Business, Taichung 403454, Taiwan.;Hsieh, MY (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Grad Coll Sustainabil & Green Energy, Taoyuan City 320317, Taiwan.",cpawisely@mail.ntcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,53,2,2,11,11,,,,2543-1536,2542-6605,,,,DEC,2024,28,,,,,,,,101382,10.1016/j.iot.2024.101382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iot.2024.101382,,SEP 2024,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This report creates and critically evaluates two complementary accounting mechanisms for air pollution emissions resulting from local transportation systems-for use in ESG disclosure and impact mitigation planning. These mechanisms are applied to a case study of businesses involved in food freight in Los Angeles: demonstrating the scope of local goods movement impacts on air quality and climate, and paving a path for additional analyses to follow. By quantifying the scope of impact from certain business and supply chain operations, this analysis makes the case for enhanced corporate responsibility by documenting and then reducing transportation system emissions from supply chain and logistics systems.","[Nowlan, Aileen; Fine, James; O'Connor, Timothy] Environm Def Fund, 257 Pk Ave S, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Burget, Spencer] Atlas Publ Policy, Washington, DC 20001 USA",Environmental Defense Fund,"Nowlan, A (corresponding author), Environm Def Fund, 257 Pk Ave S, New York, NY 10010 USA.",anowlan@edf.org; jfine@edf.org; toconnor@edf.org; spencer.burget@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,4,4,4,39,,,,,2071-1050,,,,SEP,2021,13,18,,,,,,,10194,10.3390/su131810194,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131810194,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is urgent and important to protect the environment, promote green transformation, and realize sustainable development. Consequently, increasing attention is being paid to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) actions. This study empirically investigated the effect of companies' ESG activities on the ESG perceptions and purchase intentions of agricultural food consumers in Hebei Province, China, using structural equation modeling. The results of the study show that, firstly, the environmental and social factors of ESG activities had a significant positive effect on consumer ESG perception while governance had a non-significant effect on consumer ESG perception. Secondly, the environmental, social, and governance components of ESG activities had a significant positive effect on purchase intention. Thirdly, there was a significant mediating effect of consumer ESG perception (environmental and social, excluding governance). The theoretical contribution of this study is to reveal the important role of consumers' ESG perceptions and to emphasize the unique contribution of governance factors in purchase intentions. In addition, this study supports the effect of ESG activities on agri-food consumer behavior through empirical data, which provides a new theoretical perspective on agri-food retailers' ESG practices and helps to further promote the green transformation of Chinese agricultural food retailers.","[Song, Pan-Ting; Kang, Tae-Won] Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Logist, Gunsan 54150, South Korea; [Oyunbazar, Batsuuri] Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Global Start Up, Gunsan 54150, South Korea",Kunsan National University; Kunsan National University,"Kang, TW (corresponding author), Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Logist, Gunsan 54150, South Korea.",2120169@kunsan.ac.kr; 2120168@kunsan.ac.kr; twkang@kunsan.ac.kr,,,,,,,65,0,0,40,40,,,,,2071-1050,,,,OCT,2024,16,19,,,,,,,8376,10.3390/su16198376,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16198376,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, (i) the SSH have too often been sidelined and/or narrowly pigeonholed by policymakers, funders, and other decision-makers when driving research agendas, and (ii) the setting of SSH-focused research agendas has not historically embedded inclusive and deliberative processes. The aim of this paper is to address these gaps through the production of a research agenda outlining future SSH research priorities for energy efficiency. A Horizon Scanning exercise was run, which sought to identify 100 priority SSH questions for energy efficiency research. This exercise included 152 researchers with prior SSH expertise on energy efficiency, who together spanned 62 (sub-)disciplines of SSH, 23 countries, and a full range of career stages. The resultant questions were inductively clustered into seven themes as follows: (1) Citizenship, engagement and knowledge exchange in relation to energy efficiency; (2) Energy efficiency in relation to equity, justice, poverty and vulnerability; (3) Energy efficiency in relation to everyday life and practices of energy consumption and production; (4) Framing, defining and measuring energy efficiency; (5) Governance, policy and political issues around energy efficiency; (6) Roles of economic systems, supply chains and financial mechanisms in improving energy efficiency; and (7) The interactions, unintended consequences and rebound effects of energy efficiency interventions. Given the consistent centrality of energy efficiency in policy programmes, this paper highlights that well-developed SSH approaches are ready to be mobilised to contribute to the development, and/or to understand the implications, of energy efficiency measures and governance solutions. Implicitly, it also emphasises the heterogeneity of SSH policy evidence that can be produced. The agenda will be of use for both (1) those new to the energy-SSH field (including policyworkers), for learnings on the capabilities and capacities of energy-SSH, and (2) established energy-SSH researchers, for insights on the collectively held futures of energy-SSH research.","[Foulds, Chris; Royston, Sarah; Bharucha, Zareen Pervez; Robison, Rosie] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Global Sustainabil Inst, Cambridge, England; [Berker, Thomas] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Ctr Technol & Soc, Trondheim, Norway; [Nakopoulou, Efi; Arapostathis, Stathis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Athens, Greece; [Abram, Simone] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham, England; [Abram, Simone] Univ Durham, Durham Energy Inst, Durham, England; [Ancic, Branko] Inst Social Res Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Badescu, Gabriel] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj, Dept Polit Sci, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Bull, Richard] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, Nottingham, England; [Cohen, Jed] Salt River Project Integrated Syst Planning & Sup, Tempe, AZ USA; [Dunlop, Tessa] European Commiss, Unit Knowledge Policy Concepts & Methods H1, Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Dunphy, Niall] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn & Architecture, Cork, Ireland; [Dunphy, Niall] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Dupont, Claire] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Governance & Management, Ghent, Belgium; [Fischer, Corinna] Oeko Inst eV, Sustainable Prod & Mat Flows Div, Darmstadt, Germany; [Gram-Hanssen, Kirsten] Aalborg Univ, Dept Built Environm, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Grandclement, Catherine] Elect France EDF, Res Grp Energy Technol & Soc, Paris, France; [Heiskanen, Eva] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Jeliazkova, Maria] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Dept Publ Policies & Social Changes, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Jorgens, Helge] Iscte Inst Univ Lisboa, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Policy, Lisbon, Portugal; [Keller, Margit] Univ Tartu, Inst Social Studies, Tartu, Estonia; [Kern, Florian] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Ecol Econ & Environm Policy, Berlin, Germany; [Lombardi, Patrizia] Politecn Torino, Urban & Reg Interuniv Dept, Turin, Italy; [Mourik, Ruth] DuneWorks, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Ornetzeder, Michael] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Technol Assessment, Vienna, Austria; [Pearson, Peter J.

The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS. It makes the case for adopting a holistic, 4-P (planet, people, profit, policy) approach in agri-food system studies.","[El Bilali, Hamid] Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies CIHEAM Ba, I-70010 Bari, Italy; [Strassner, Carola] FH Munster Univ Appl Sci, Dept Food Nutr & Facil, D-48149 Munich, Germany; [Ben Hassen, Tarek] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Int Affairs, Doha 2713, Qatar","CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI; University of Applied Sciences, Muenster; Qatar University","El Bilali, H (corresponding author), Int Ctr Adv Mediterranean Agron Studies CIHEAM Ba, I-70010 Bari, Italy.",elbilali@iamb.it; strassner@fh-muenster.de; thassen@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,,1323,79,81,32,191,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUN,2021,13,11,,,,,,,6260,10.3390/su13116260,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13116260,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on CI resilience, disaster risk reduction, supply chain sustainability, energy and climate adaptation literature, this study seeks to learn from the contemporary TFS vulnerabilities to avoid perpetuating them in a future climate-resilient, equitable, and carbon free transportation energy system. A unique combination of five vulnerability traits is identified: unprecedented transition; complex and widespread interdependencies; hazardous materials; complex organizational networks; and path-dependency. Emblematic TFS-related disasters in the U.S., and the projected impact of wildfires and flooding to the sector in California are explored to illustrate these vulnerabilities and their environmental justice (EJ) issues. We argue that our lack of knowledge of CI sociotechnical networks is a key vulnerability that jeopardizes societal goals of decarbonization policies, notably those concerning (1) procedural justice and (2) the identification of transportation energy services critical users such as emergency response. We propose framing the TFS as a social, technical, and environmental system to promote complex system governance that is more capable of identifying strategic partnerships and coalitions for CI resilience, and developing methods to study and implement climate risk transparency and adaptation attribution that advances procedural aspects of EJ for the transitional and future TFS.","[Lindbergh, Sarah; Radke, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 230 Bauer Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lindbergh, Sarah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Transportat Studies, 107B Mclaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [He, Yiyi] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Design, Sch City & Reg Planning, 245 Fourth St NW,Suite 204 E, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Radke, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, City & Reg Planning, 230, Bauer Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lindbergh, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, 230 Bauer Wurster Hall 2000, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",sarah_lindbergh@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,124,1,1,10,10,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,AUG,2024,114,,,,,,,,103585,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2024.103585,,MAY 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With China controlling the majority of global critical mineral production and processing, geopolitical competition and concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities are on the rise. This perspective article presents the concept of friend-shoring within the context of energy studies, using the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) as a case study to examine its effects on critical mineral supply chains, energy transition, and international energy relations. Although friend-shoring may help alleviate supply chain vulnerabilities for Western nations, the success of the MSP depends on striking a balance between reducing reliance on China and managing the economic costs of alternative initiatives that support national and geopolitical security, all while upholding environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. The article also proposes directions for future research on friend-shoring and the MSP within energy studies, which has the potential to offer valuable insights into their effects on critical minerals supply chains, the energy transition and international energy relations.","[Vivoda, Vlado] Rabdan Acad, Dhafeer St, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Vivoda, V (corresponding author), Rabdan Acad, Dhafeer St, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",vvivoda@ra.ac.ae,,,,,,,73,38,40,44,125,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,JUN,2023,100,,,,,,,,103085,10.1016/j.erss.2023.103085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2023.103085,,APR 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It argues that, not only they are unsuccessful on their own terms, but also they actually make the task more difficult by the unintended consequence of normalising the act of polluting and crowding out alternatives. The theoretical contribution of the paper is to draw a link between two bodies of literature. The first is the business ethics literature on the dominance of market-based rather than direct regulation, and the second is the literature on market ethics, particularly the work of Michael Sandel on how MBMs crowd out non-market norms. The empirical contribution is to use the international maritime transport sector to illustrate the way market-based regulation renders alternatives such as direct regulation and supply-side approaches invisible.","[Monios, Jason] Kedge Business Sch, BP 921, F-13288 Marseille 9, France",Kedge Business School,"Monios, J (corresponding author), Kedge Business Sch, BP 921, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",jason.monios@kedgebs.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [895-2017-1003],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(CGIARSocial Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research has been partly supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project (N circle 895-2017-1003) on Green Shipping: Governance and Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain.,,94,4,4,10,38,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,OCT,2023,187,2,,,,,283,299,,10.1007/s10551-022-05256-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-022-05256-1,,SEP 2022,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Meanwhile, corporate sustainability relies on the effective management of natural capital and ecosystem services used in production. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) offers an important practical mechanism for addressing these issues. However, the uptake of corporate-financed PES has been underwhelming, implying that companies may face institutional and motivational challenges to participate in PES. This article presents an assessment framework to determine the conduciveness of PES to real-world corporate environmental strategies and actions, be they (a) voluntary or compliance-based, (b) reactive or proactive, (c) requiring low or high amounts of data, (d) seeking a direct or indirect return on investment (ROI), (e) conducted proximal to or far from the operation site, (f) short-term or long-term, and (g) utilising internal or external resources. Interview data elicited from public, private, and civil sector actors in Thailand and the Philippines highlights key barriers to corporate-financed PES. Results imply companies may be: (1) hesitant to get involved with unknown or uncertain concepts such as ecosystem services; (2) reluctant to fund the technical studies and repeat payments that PES requires; (3) disinterested in direct ROI-instead content with philanthropic projects that can boost public relations; and (4) bound by protocols that restrict the spatial and temporal scales at which PES can operate. To overcome these challenges, policy makers could devise reputational and economic incentives, and incorporate ecosystem services into existing institutions such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and ISO 14001. Meanwhile, PES practitioners (government agencies and NGOs) should use quick and simple metrics to quantify ecosystem services, and tolerate buyer willingness-to-pay. Increasing corporate ecosystem service demand, and participation in PES, will likely require firm-level institutional change, and business strategies to improve supply chain management and mitigate the negative effects of environmental and climate change.","[Thompson, Benjamin S.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Thompson, BS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",Benjamin.thompson@u.nus.edu,,,National University of Singapore (NUS),National University of Singapore (NUS)(National University of Singapore),"I am grateful to two anonymous reviewers for insightful comments that have improved this manuscript.

P is also responsible for endemic eutrophication in waterbodies due to poor stewardship in the food chain. Catchments are natural social-ecologically bounded systems for P use in agriculture and water management. Stakeholders, such as farmers, water and sewerage service companies, local authorities, and environmental organisations mediate catchment adaptive capacity to P supply risks and P pollution in waterbodies. Adaptive capacity at this level has been insufficiently explored in addressing the P challenge, yet is essential to it. We address this gap by exploring through a qualitative study of stakeholders in two United Kingdom catchments. Our results suggest that the awareness and relevance of P-supply challenges is low in catchments, but the problem of waterbody vulnerability to excess P is of greater concern. Our findings highlight the roles in adaptive capacity of entrenched practices; knowledge and training activities and organisations; stakeholder cooperation and synergy; funding, infrastructure, and technology; the governance environment; and time needed to draw down P. We find that farmers and water companies are especially important to adaptive capacity as they directly interact with P flows. We therefore suggest that catchment adaptive capacity would be significantly improved through a well supported, and expanded package of existing efforts such as providing scientific evidence of catchment P dynamics; training; payments; more empowered local governance. This effort would support catchment stakeholders to adopt effective P-stewardship practices within a multi-decade integrated catchment management strategy.","[Lyon, Christopher; Martin-Ortega, Julia] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lyon, Christopher] McGill Univ, Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Jacobs, Brent] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rothwell, Shane A.; Forber, Kirsty J.; Withers, Paul J.

In this article, I focus on how such technocratic interventions are transforming the processes by which tropical timber is technically rendered into calculational abstractions known as volumes in Peru's tropical timber supply chains. Drawing on twenty-four months of fieldwork following the activities of loggers, timber industrialists, and state technocrats across Peru's Amazonian region of Loreto, I show how calculational abstractions can never fully circumvent the frictions of power, history, and bodily experience. Rather, technocratic interventions aiming to standardize tropical timber -calculation procedures ultimately transform volumes into fertile ethnographic terrains from which to appreciate how competing forms of political imagination intersect and collide with each other as Amazonia enters the age of climate change and biodiversity loss.","[Dianderas, Eduardo romero] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Dianderas, ER (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",,,,Social Science Research Council; National Science Foundation; Explorer's Club,Social Science Research Council; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Explorer's Club,"Acknowledgments Funding for this research was generously provided by the Wen- ner-Gren Foundation, the Social Science Research Council, the National Science Foundation, and the Explorer's Club.

New mines must be developed to supply the 34 minerals necessary for low-carbon energy technologies and infrastructure. Responsible investment is critical to ensure that mining for the energy transition does not come at unacceptable social and environmental costs. Investment decisions rely on access to site-level information. Achieving both reliable and sustainable mineral supply chains is a complex proposition that requires deep local-level knowledge for all sites across the supply chain. This paper analyses a global dataset of local disclosures for 444 geolocated mining projects hosting the bulk of future energy transition minerals supply. The dataset captures disclosures related to the interactions between mining projects and their local context and connects a supply source point and its host context to global supply chains. Our analysis reveals the paucity of local-level data, with 37% of analysed records containing no context-related disclosure, and another 30% containing minimal, compliance-centred disclosure. We also find evidence of disclosure not matching reality, e.g. 78% of records of projects intersecting Indigenous peoples land do not have Indigenous people-related disclosures. These findings put into question the capacity of investors and governments to make informed decisions about mining development, including which sites to develop and how. We also analyse the magnitude and types of costs incurred at mine sites and find that 12% of projects face or have faced severe costs originating from interactions with the local context. We stress the need for full local disclosures to ensure responsible governance and investment in the mining sector.","[Lebre, Eleonore; Sharma, Vigya; Remigio, Amelia Corzo] Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Lèbre, E (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Social Responsibil Min, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",e.lebre@uq.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DE220101129]; Australian Research Council [DE220101129] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors would like to thank Professor Deanna Kemp for her invaluable advice and feedback throughout the preparation of this paper.

Additionally, the effects of industry sector, firm size, and governance practices on transparency are examined. Design/methodology/approach - Data were retrieved from Bloomberg using the financial analysis environmental, social and governance function for companies comprising the S&P 500 index. Descriptive statistics are provided on each of the three components separately (ESG). Nonparametric procedures are used to test for significant differences in transparency within each of these three areas based on industry sector. Additionally, nonparametric tests are used to determine the impact of firm size (market capitalization) and governance factors (board size, board gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, and linking executive compensation to ESG disclosure) on the composite ESG score. Findings - Descriptive statistics reveal that S&P 500 companies differ in their level of disclosure across the three areas (ESG). The highest level of transparency is found on Governance and the lowest on Environmental. Moreover, there is much variability in the percentage of S&P 500 companies disclosing information about specific Social policies (e.g. child labor). Significant differences in transparency on both the Social and Governance dimensions are found between certain industry sectors. The results also reveal that large-cap companies have significantly higher ESG disclosure scores than mid-cap companies and that governance factors impact ESG disclosure. Significantly, higher ESG disclosure scores are observed for S&P 500 firms with larger boards of directors, with boards that are more gender diverse, that allow CEO duality, and that link executive compensation to ESG scores. Originality/value - This study focuses on corporate transparency through a granular analysis of ESG disclosure scores when most other studies have been primarily conducted at the macro level. Stakeholders, analysts, and shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing firms' sustainability disclosures in their assessment of management quality, as it reflects on the practices/policies that are employed to improve firms' environmental and social footprints.","[Tamimi, Nabil; Sebastianelli, Rose] Univ Scranton, Kania Sch Management, Dept Operat & Informat Management, Scranton, PA 18510 USA",University of Scranton,"Tamimi, N (corresponding author), Univ Scranton, Kania Sch Management, Dept Operat & Informat Management, Scranton, PA 18510 USA.",nabil.tamimi@scranton.edu,,,,,,,66,266,283,41,552,,,,0025-1747,1758-6070,,,,,2017,55,8,,,,,1660,1680,,10.1108/MD-01-2017-0018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-01-2017-0018,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

They place pressure on supply chains to become sustainable, and for this reason, third-party logistics (3PL) service providers, as specialized professionals, play a vital role in sustainable supply chain management. Although developments in technology in the era of Industry 4.0 have been effective at directing 3PLs along the path towards sustainability, integrated management of forward and reverse logistics systems in order to achieve a circular economy and to become sustainable remains a problem, even in developed countries. However, benchmarking and using the experiences of others can help to speed up this path at a minimal cost. An interval type-2 fuzzy super-slack-based measure network DEA was developed to make such benchmarking possible. Governance style, staff behavior, environmental management systems, and social elements are considered, alongside the principles of the circular economy, in order to compare the sustainability performance of 17 3PLs with respect to different aspects through the application of the developed DEA model. Proper benchmarking with respect to strategies and operations of the 3PLs that are recognized as efficient makes it possible for these 3PLs to overcome obstacles and progress at a lower cost. The results show that 3PLs do not have a comprehensive sustainability strategy that is coordinated with an overall vision of the total supply chain. An investigation into the development of a framework with multiple steps for the guidance of 3PLs, as well as the whole supply chain, towards sustainability in the Industry 4.0 era would be a fruitful next study.","[Pishdar, Mahsa] Univ Tehran, Dept Ind & Technol Management, Fac Management & Accounting, Coll Farabi, Qom 1746937181, Iran; [Danesh Shakib, Masoumeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Qazvin Branch, Ind Management Dept, Qazvin 341851416, Iran; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita; Vilkonis, Arvydas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Tehran; Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Antucheviciene, J (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",pishdarmahsa@gmail.com; m.shakib@qiau.ac.ir; jurgita.antucheviciene@vilniustech.lt; arvydas.vilkonis@stud.vgtu.lt,,,,,,,81,13,13,2,66,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUN,2021,13,11,,,,,,,6497,10.3390/su13116497,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13116497,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The import of large amounts will be required, but stakeholders have sustainability concerns. Utilities are adopting self-regulatory certification schemes to reduce stakeholder pressures but the interplay between these efforts, stakeholder and policy dynamics, and business risks is not well understood. This study uses literature, interviews, and a survey of 120 stakeholders to delineate influential actors in the discourse, principal concerns, and ways to ameliorate opposition and risk. The work finds many actors opposed to forest energy systems, and shows how critique is directed toward a nexus of industry and policymakers. It also indicates that critics have an ascendant status and can catalyze changes in policy and business practice in response to their concerns. Key concerns involve carbon, biodiversity, and deforestation; however, it is found that self-governance systems do not yet incorporate metrics to meet emerging expectations. The study concludes that efforts must deliver robust track records of strong ecological, climate, and social performance for forest energy supply chains to allay concerns - as distinct from just sustainability certification'. Work must include increased efforts to source woody biomass from the EU-27(+) to engender trust in forest energy actors, and scientific studies to delineate strong' versus weak' carbon and temporal carbon' performance for forest energy systems. This also suggests a need to delineate silvicultural regimes that facilitate the management of forest energy supply chains for improved carbon performance.

At its core, CSR aims to align business values with the needs and expectations of a broader range of stakeholders, beyond just investors and shareholders. In oil palm, this entails taking responsibility for social and environmental impacts, often beyond what is required by law, to build social and environmental capital in pursuit of a local license to operate. Third-party certification standards are a popular tool for guiding and monitoring the impact of CSR programs and have taken root in oil palm through the multi-stakeholder Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Eight years running, the RSPO has made substantial inroads to improve the environmental and social performance of Southeast Asia's largest and fastest growing plantation industry. Yet serious challenges remain for RSPO to mainstream environmentally sustainable and socially responsible practices throughout the supply chain. Based on experiences working with multi-stakeholder groups to implement RSPO, including industry, government, local communities, and NGOs, we highlight areas where change is required not only among growers but also the broader RSPO membership to build on recent achievements and accelerate progress. Major challenges include (1) improving corporate governance of plantation companies to translate boardroom CSR decisions into conservation actions on the ground; (2) pushing RSPO member processors, traders, manufacturers, and retailers, who profit from palm oil, to share the cost burden of implementing sustainability, (3) strengthening NGO partnerships with companies to provide the social and environmental expertise companies require but still lack, and (4) creating a more supportive regulatory structure in producer countries to implement sustainability. Challenges to RSPO progress can be overcome, but will require coordinated action to ensure that the scale and pace of change is sufficient to deliver long-term benefits for the environment before it is too late.","[Paoli, Gary D.; Yaap, Betsy; Wells, Philip L.; Sileuw, Aisyah] Daemeter Consulting, Bogor 16151, West Java, Indonesia; [Yaap, Betsy] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia",James Cook University,"Paoli, GD (corresponding author), Daemeter Consulting, Jl Tangkuban Perahu 6, Bogor 16151, West Java, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,14,27,30,0,80,,,,1940-0829,,,,,,2010,3,4,,,,,438,446,,10.1177/194008291000300408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/194008291000300408,,,,Biodiversity Conservation,,Biodiversity & Conservation,,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each stage of the fossil fuel life cycle - extraction, processing, transport, and combustion - generates toxic air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions that drive the global climate crisis. Addressing the harmful effects of energy decisions, including unequal risk distribution across various governance levels, supply chains, and political jurisdictions, is a complex task for policymakers and society. A deeper understanding of how harms are embodied within fossil fuel life cycles is needed. This paper provides a narrative review of recent studies within the United States (U.S.) that document both public health harms and disproportionate impacts along the fossil fuel life cycle. In the U.S. the public health hazards from air and water pollution, and risks associated with climate change, fall disproportionately on Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor communities. Sacrifice zones and systemic racism are deeply intertwined within the fossil-fuel based economy. We argue systemic racism subsidizes the fossil fuel industry by enabling it to externalize the costs of pollution and environmental degradation onto communities of color. We position fossil fuel racism as a subset of environmental racism and argue that this framing is useful because it shifts analytical and political focus to the systems and structures which are actively protecting and promoting continued production of fossil fuels. We discuss the implications of this body of research for climate policy, and outline how poorly designed carbon-centric policies-which focus narrowly on GHGs reduction-could fail to alleviate the racialized disparities or potentially worsen it for some communities. We emphasize the need to move beyond carbon-centric approaches to climate solutions to more integrative approaches to policy design that can improve public health, tackle the global climate crisis, and rectify our legacy of fossil fuel racism. Specifically we call for a managed phase out of fossil fuel production and the enactment of wider programs of social, economic, and democratic reforms via a Green New Deal. Adequately addressing the climate crisis and fossil fuel racism require political and policy solutions that disrupt the power and actions of the fossil fuel industry and their state allies.","[Donaghy, Timothy Q.; Jiang, Charles Y.] Greenpeace USA, 1300 1St NW,Suite 1100 East, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Healy, Noel] Salem State Univ, Dept Geog, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA 01970 USA; [Battle, Colette Pichon] Taproot Earth, Slidell, LA USA; [Jiang, Charles Y.] Yale Law Sch, 127 Wall St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Salem State University; Yale University,"Donaghy, TQ (corresponding author), Greenpeace USA, 1300 1St NW,Suite 1100 East, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",tim.donaghy@greenpeace.org,,,,,,,258,49,53,32,75,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,JUN,2023,100,,,,SI,,,,103104,10.1016/j.erss.2023.103104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2023.103104,,MAY 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using secondary data from diverse sources on the supply networks of 319 firms, extending to the Tier-2 level, we present and test a robust empirical model that also accounts for potential endogeneity effects. To understand this key relationship between BSN complexity and environmental performance at a deeper level, we further test the moderating influence of BSN members' reach on this key relationship. We also test the moderating effects of a focal firm's control over its BSN on this key relationship. We find that both the vertical complexity dimension and the horizontal complexity dimension of BSNs had a U-shaped relationship with the participating firms' GHG emissions. In contrast, the spatial complexity dimension of BSNs had a positive impact on the participating firms' GHG emissions. With respect to the moderating effects, we found that firms' control over their BSN negatively influenced these relationships, whereas the reach of the BSN members positively influenced these relationships. Taken together, this set of mixed-pattern findings casts new light on the broad literature of multitier BSNs, environmental sustainability, and the effective management of supply chains. The managerial implications of our findings are also discussed.","[Adhikary, Anirban] Indian Inst Management Udaipur, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Sharma, Amalesh] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Diatha, Krishna Sundar] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Prod & Operat Management Area, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Jayaram, Jayanth] Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Udaipur (IIMU); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",anirban.adhikary@iimu.ac.in; asharma@mays.tamu.edu; diatha@iimb.ac.in; jayaram@moore.sc.edu,,,Wipro Limited,Wipro Limited,The first author would like to thank Wipro Limited for the Wipro Sustainability Fellowship during his PhD programme.,,88,24,26,5,38,,,,0925-5273,1873-7579,,,,DEC,2020,230,,,,,,,,107864,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107864,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107864,,,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Gadinis, S; Miazad, A",,,,"Gadinis, Stavros; Miazad, Amelia",,,Corporate Law and Social Risk,VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW,,,,Article,,,,,,,GOOD FAITH; RESPONSIBILITY; FIRM; OVERCONFIDENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DISCLOSURES; CHARACTER; TRUST,"Over a quarter of total assets under management are now invested in socially responsible companies. This turn to sustainability has gained solid ground over the last few years, earning the commitment of hundreds of CEOs and dominating the global business agenda. This marks an astounding repudiation of Wall Street's get-rich-quick mentality, as well as a direct challenge to corporate law's reigning mantra of profit maximization above all. But corporate law scholars are skeptical about the rise of sustainability. Some scoff at companies' promises to do the right thing as empty rhetoric. But companies are revisiting core business practices and adjusting central governance mechanisms, such as executive compensation, to reward improvements in sustainability performance. For other theorists, directors and officers beholden to shareholder primacy can opt for sustainability only as long as it also maximizes profits. While doctrinally straightforward, this approach is highly problematic in practice. The wide range of issues nurtured under the sustainability movement-ranging from environment and climate, to diversity and other workplace concerns, to privacy and supply chain management-do not always lend themselves readily to a profit-maximizing logic and are often costly in the short term. We offer a new solution to this quandary. We argue that, through their sustainability initiatives, companies are looking primarily for safeguards against downside risks, and not simply for opportunities to increase their profits. Social risk has proven highly destructive for corporate value even when the company's key failure is not violating laws, as the recent crises at Facebook and Uber demonstrate. Sustainability can help avoid such crises because it provides corporate boards with input from stakeholders such as employees, NGOs, local authorities, and regulatory agencies. These stakeholders are uniquely placed to register the impact of company policies on the ground and can communicate concerns early. Contrasting sustainability with compliance, the only risk monitoring mechanism sanctioned in our laws, we note distinct advantages. While compliance's scope is tethered to legal violations, sustainability encourages intervention even when laws have not caught up. Compliance's emphasis on detection and punishment distorts management's incentives and incites fears of retribution in stakeholders. Rather than dwelling on the past, sustainability builds a new vision for the future hoping to inspire and gain trust. We base our account of sustainability on interviews and roundtable discussions with over three hundred participants, including leading public and private companies, large asset managers, investors and pension funds, shareholder advisory firms, and sustainability standard setters and data providers. Our conversations confirm that it was investors who pushed hard for environmental and social initiatives, putting pressure on more reserved managers and boards. We argue that investors' support for sustainability is precisely because it helps fight risks that are otherwise hard to diversify. Asset managers, in particular, who own significant positions in every U.S. public company, are exposed to industry-wide and market-wide risk and may suffer externalities from a company's reckless behavior. While investors have been early supporters, CEOs and executives are only recently opening up to sustainability, which continues to face some resistance in corporate boardrooms. We argue that directors' and officers' unwillingness to address social risk is a manifestation of agency conflicts. Averting crises is a thankless task, and boards have few incentives to undertake action without external pressure. Moreover, the intractability of many sustainability concerns, combined with management's confidence in the company's success, leads to systematically downplaying social risk. But by failing to establish an appropriate sustainability function, directors and managers are unnecessarily exposing their shareholders to increased risk. Boards should ensure that their company has a well-running sustainability function with proper board oversight that reaches out to stakeholders relevant to the company's business. This governance reform, we conclude, is essential to allow sustainability to reach its full potential.","[Gadinis, Stavros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Miazad, Amelia] Business Soc Inst Berkeley Law, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Gadinis, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,296,55,57,2,12,,,,0042-2533,1942-9886,,,,OCT,2020,73,5,,,,,1401,1477,,,,,,,Law,,Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is perhaps unsurprising, given that limited literature on the theory and practice of PES has a dedicated focus on businesses. This article unifies the PES and business literatures in order to address the awareness and management challenges that corporations face in engaging in PES. First, it shows how corporations fit into the economic theory that underpins PES, demonstrating that corporate-financed PES schemes can exhibit a diversity and hybridity of Coasean and Pigouvian characteristics. Second, it shows how PES fits into corporate sustainability theory, demonstrating how PES can help companies achieve synergies across the economic, environmental, and social tenets of the triple bottom line; for example, by helping gain social license to operate from adjacent communities, or by using PES to meet sustainability reporting requirements related to emissions and water management. Third, it shows the different PES options available to firms based on their industrial sector, operating practices, and business strategies. The options with higher potential are maintenance and enhancement of production inputs across the supply chain, and carbon offsetting and insetting to help meet climate change mitigation regulations and avoid fines. Fourth, it identifies lessons learned when transitioning from theory to practice by synthesising the latest empirical research on corporate-financed PES schemes-considering exactly what these 'should' or 'could' resemble, for example, in terms of their additionality, conditionality, permanence, co-benefits, budgeting, and bargaining. Examples are drawn from corporate-financed schemes in forests and watersheds across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The article concludes that these schemes remain small in number and size, but have significant potential to increase-and this can be aided by future research on corporate motives, understandings, and actions on PES.","[Thompson, Benjamin S.] Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Thompson, BS (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Fac Arts, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",benjamin.thompson@monash.edu,,,,,,,99,10,11,8,60,,,,,2071-1050,,,,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8307,10.3390/su13158307,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158307,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the mechanisms for achieving these interlinked goals are not well understood. Here we analyse the wind energy manufacturing global value chain, using a dataset on 389 component supplier firms (2006-2016) that work with 13 original equipment manufacturers. We assess how technology complexity, that is, the knowledge intensity and difficulty of manufacturing components, shapes the location of suppliers. For countries without existing wind industries, we find evidence of the emergence of suppliers for only low-complexity components (for example, towers and generators). For countries with existing wind industries, we find that suppliers' evolution, that is, changes in their international supply relationships, is less likely for high-complexity components (for example, blades and gearboxes). Our findings show the importance of understanding technologies along with firms and countries within global value chains for achieving policy goals. Clean energy technology manufacturing relies on global value chains, yet the patterns of these chains are poorly understood, obscuring the underlying drivers.

Campaigns since 2007 to demand that brands stop buying palm oil linked to tropical deforestation confirm the rising influence over corporate policies and market demand. Many activists are portraying the outcomes as victories toward saving rainforests. Yet, three factors are limiting the value for improving on-the-ground management: industry influence over, and governance limits of, palm oil certification; ongoing sales of uncertified palm oil as demand shifts to nonbrand buyers; and illegalities and weak regulatory enforcement in producer countries, notably Indonesia and Malaysia. Theoretically, this analysis demonstrates the importance, when evaluating activist campaigns, of distinguishing between the influence on corporate policies and markets and the effectiveness for environmental outcomes.","[Dauvergne, Peter] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Dauvergne, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, C425-1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",peter.dauvergne@ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [435-2014-00115],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: A grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (reference number 435-2014-00115) supported research for this article.",,94,58,63,0,45,,,,1070-4965,1552-5465,,,,JUN,2017,26,2,,,,,135,155,,10.1177/1070496517701249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1070496517701249,,,,Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,,Development Studies; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It explores the mechanisms by which ESG performance influences debt risk, including diversification of funding sources, optimized capital utilization, and improved market supply-demand dynamics. The mitigating effect of ESG on debt risk is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, large corporations, and corporations with robust internal controls, especially under conditions of low marketization and adverse macroeconomic circumstances. Moreover, in light of the global emphasis on climate risks, this study assesses their significant influence on debt default risk, particularly through the environmental aspect of ESG. Innovatively, this study incorporates dual climate risk scenarios to comprehensively analyze the interaction between ESG performance and debt default risk. Findings indicate that ESG performance significantly lowers debt risk in corporates facing higher internal climate challenges, while the effects on external supply chain climate risks are less evident. These insights contribute to the theoretical understanding of ESG and financial risk management and provide practical strategies for corporates pursuing sustainability in an unstable climatic environment.","[Shang, Yuping; Xiao, Zisheng] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Nasim, Asma] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, England; [Zhao, Xin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Manchester Metropolitan University; Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Zhao, X (corresponding author), Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",shangyuping@hfut.edu.cn; 2021214437@mail.hfut.edu.cn; A.Nasim@mmu.ac.uk; zhaoshin_1993@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72304084, 72403001]; Social Sciences Planning Youth Project of Anhui Province [AHSKQ2022D138, AHSKQ2023D059]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [2408085QG228]; Anhui Province Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions [2023AH030015]; Innovation Development Research Project of Anhui Province [2023CX507]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Sciences Planning Youth Project of Anhui Province; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Anhui Province Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions; Innovation Development Research Project of Anhui Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72304084, 72403001) , the Social Sciences Planning Youth Project of Anhui Province (Grant No. AHSKQ2022D138, AHSKQ2023D059) , the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Grant No. 2408085QG228) , the Anhui Province Excellent Young Talents Fund Program of Higher Education Institutions (Grant No. 2023AH030015) , and the Innovation Development Research Project of Anhui Province (Grant No. 2023CX507) .",,86,1,1,31,31,,,,0261-5606,1873-0639,,,,FEB,2025,151,,,,,,,,103248,10.1016/j.jimonfin.2024.103248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jimonfin.2024.103248,,NOV 2024,,"Business, Finance",,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using the case of Australian beef, the authors construct and evaluate three procurement activity portfolios and evaluate how these activity sets pull towards or against diverse organisational goals and/or science-based sustainability objectives. Design/methodology/approachA review of the academic and practitioner literature identified three key pillars for sustainable Australian beef procurement: animal welfare, environmental management and climate change (i.e. emissions). A subset of sustainable beef production activities (n = 100) was identified through this review plus semi-structured interviews with Australian beef retailers and industry bodies. This activity set was filtered (n = 40) and scored by a panel of science experts via a series of workshops and an additional survey. Using these data, the authors use a k-means cluster analysis (k = 3) to consider the strong or weak contributions of each activity portfolio towards typical sustainable beef goals. FindingsA portfolio-based view of sustainable procurement puts the trade-offs between activities and the need for clear sustainability prioritisation into sharp focus. The authors find that individual strategies may be singularly more or less impactful, complex or popular, but when combined as a suite of activities enacted towards a particular goal or set of goals, essential for success. The authors find that obtaining balance across sustainable beef pillars versus within specific pillars can narrow the optimal set of activities that can succeed against multiple sustainability goals. Practical implicationsFor procurement managers, the balance between clear focus and multidimensional progress is a difficult challenge. It requires the bold identification and articulation of an organisation's interlocking corporate, industry or environmental objectives and flexibility on the strategies, tools and resources required. The authors posit that shifting away from a focus on rigid metrics may be useful in breaking the impasse on meaningful action. Social implicationsUsing a set of known activities and strategies that a procurement manager might draw from in operationalising sustainability goals, the authors cluster activities into three discrete activity portfolios. Each portfolio requires differing levels of effort, implementation complexity and potential for within-pillar and cross-pillar impact (i.e. co-benefits). Assessing the evidence and potential for cross-pillar impacts of individual strategies is a complex undertaking, indicative of the systems and tangled interactions that characterise sustainability science more broadly. Originality/valueBy assessing how the procurement function can be leveraged and operationalised towards sustainability goals through a lens of optimal portfolio management, the authors provide a way forward for the procurement managers working within large retailers and agri-food businesses to progress towards multiple sustainability pillars simultaneously.","[Ricketts, Katie D.

Despite urgent calls for diversification on regional scales, particularly in regions dominated by industrialized, low-diversity agriculture, strategies for diversification on such scales are in early stages of development, conceptually and practically. We outline such a strategy, and its implementation by the Forever Green Partnership, a public-private-NGO coalition in support of agricultural diversification in the U.S. Midwest region. Our strategy supports introduction and scaling of multiple novel crops in a region, which requires development of many interdependent supporting elements, including supportive markets, infrastructure, policy, finance, and R&D. The core of our strategy is development of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) for a set of novel crops. We define SSCs as rudimentary systems of these supporting elements for novel crops, linking on-farm crop production to end-use markets while advancing economic, environmental, and social sustainability criteria that are demanded by stakeholders. SSCs provide a scaffold upon which fully-developed support systems for multiple novel crops can be constructed, thus driving regional diversification. SSCs cannot be built in a day; rather they must evolve as production of novel crops expands over time and space, and as new challenges and opportunities emerge. Therefore, regional diversification requires a system to sustain this evolutionary process across time and multiple novel crops. We posit that an effective system can be built from two crucial elements: a process of conscious and concerted cultural evolution, and a polycentric network that organizes and supports that process. We outline this system and its conceptual basis, and its implementation by the Forever Green Partnership, and associated challenges and accomplishments. Three years after its inception, the Partnership has attracted substantial resources, developed a polycentric network, and some elements of the cultural-evolution process are in place. However, node development is uneven across the network, hindering its operation. In addition to advancing strategies for regional-scale diversification, the Partnership is seeking to advance conceptual and practical understanding of sustainability transitions in agriculture, and to explore the potential value of conscious cultural evolution in such transitions.","[Jordan, Nicholas R.; Conway, Tara Maireid; Cureton, Colin] Univ Minnesota, Agron & Plant Genet Dept, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Wilson, David Sloan] Binghamton Univ New York, Binghamton, NY USA; [Noble, Kate; Miller, Keith] Terraluna Collaborat, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Jordan, NR (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Agron & Plant Genet Dept, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",jorda020@umn.edu,,,Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research; Walton Family Foundation; Minnesota Department of Agriculture; SAES-University of Minnesota,Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research; Walton Family Foundation; Minnesota Department of Agriculture; SAES-University of Minnesota,"This research was funded by grants and contracts from the Foundation for Food and Agricultural Research, Walton Family Foundation, Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and SAES-University of Minnesota.",,88,4,5,8,25,,,,,2571-581X,,,,MAY 18,2023,7,,,,,,,,1012759,10.3389/fsufs.2023.1012759,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1012759,,,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article proposes that 'neo-austerity urbanism' has become a relevant political strategy that supports such barriers. It considers the case of Lisbon and is informed by an interview-based inquiry aimed at identifying the implementation barriers blocking the development of transformative UA initiatives in this city while making such initiatives an integral part of neo-austerity urbanism. Three types of barriers were identified: those derived from the envisioned urban realm; the governance system in place; and the urban agriculture model envisioned.

The quantified survey comprised 669 respondents. The findings highlighted the critical role of functional transparency and telepresence of a mobile application in driving consumers' warm glow and ascribed responsibility.

Evidence from the worldwide logistics sector,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,Article,,,,,,Logistics; CSR; Performance; Reporting; Signaling; Greenwashing; ESG,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; SERVICE PROVIDERS; PERFORMANCE-MEASUREMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; REVERSE LOGISTICS; MODERATING ROLE; DISCLOSURE; GREEN; STRATEGIES,"Drawing on signaling and greenwashing theories, the objective of this study is to investigate the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and CSR reporting in the logistics sector. The CSR performance was proxied by the composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) indicator as well as its three pillars. For this purpose, the data was derived from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the years between 2012 and 2018. According to the results, companies with greater CSR performance are more likely to publish a CSR report and companies with greater CSR performance are more likely to publish a higher number of CSR reports. Thus, the results confirm the validity of the signaling theory and reject greenwashing tendency in the logistics sector. Upon findings, we suggest several implications for the logistics sector, academics, firms, and shareholders as well as stakeholders. The proven link between CSR performance-reporting sends very important signals to shareholders and other stakeholders such that the information embedded in the reports reflect the actual realization of CSR practices.

BS refers to a company's efforts to go beyond focusing only on profitability, also to manage its environmental, social, and broader economic impact on the marketplace and society as a whole. The research objective of this study is therefore to develop and test a framework of BS, based upon the triple bottom line (TBL) approach. Methodology/approach: Companies with more than 100 employees were identified to take part in the study. Respondents included executives in charge of BS initiatives, such as chief sustainability officers, sustainable business managers, and CEOs. Ultimately, 261 companies agreed to participate. Questionnaires (and an accompanying letter with survey details and contact information on the researchers) were sent to the targeted key informant in the company. A total of 110 usable questionnaires were returned, generating a final response rate of 42.1%. Findings: To assess the underlying pattern of dimensions and items of the BS framework, factor analyses were conducted. An initial factor analysis revealed 3 separate subframeworks of BS (economic, social, and environmental dimensions of the TBL-approach), all of which demonstrate satisfactory factor solutions. A second factor analysis iteration, containing all subframeworks of BS (i.e., 20 dimensions and 60 items) generated a total explained variance of 80%, although the factor loadings of 3 dimensions and their items merged with 3 other dimensions. The final factor solution generated a satisfactory 17-factor solution and explained 83% of the variance, indicating satisfactory convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity, as well as reliability of each dimension. Research implications: The study proposes a BS framework and concludes that the measurement metrics of the BS framework, which were developed and tested, are valid and reliable. Suggestions for applications, research limitations, and further research are provided. The BS framework may be used by companies to assess and monitor their sustainable business practices in the marketplace and society. The framework provides managerial structure and guidance in terms of the dimensions to be taken into consideration and also the items for measuring each of the dimensions of the BS framework in the market and society. The study is not without its limitations and further work is needed to verify the validity and reliability of the empirical findings of the BS framework across contexts and over time. As it stands, the investigation provides a foundation for further research, offering opportunities for updates, amendments, and refinements. Originality/value/contribution: A principal contribution of this study is the empirically developed and tested BS framework. It is based on the elements of the TBL approach, consisting of dimensions and measurement items. The BS framework and its hierarchical layers provide a structured contribution that assesses and monitors the managerial implementation of sustainable business practices and sustainable business models. Furthermore, the structural properties of the BS framework, in relation to contextual variables, provide additional research opportunities for the future.","[Svensson, Goran; Hogevold, Nils] Kristiania Univ Coll, PB 1195, N-0107 Oslo, Norway; [Ferro, Carlos] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Varela, Juan Carlos Sosa] Univ Turabo, Gurabo, PR USA; [Padin, Carmen] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Wagner, Beverly] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Kristiania University College; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; University of Strathclyde,"Svensson, G (corresponding author), Kristiania Univ Coll, PB 1195, N-0107 Oslo, Norway.",goran.svensson@hh.se,,,,,,,76,52,66,3,84,,,,1051-712X,1547-0628,,,,,2016,23,2,,,,,153,188,,10.1080/1051712X.2016.1169119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1051712X.2016.1169119,,,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on qualitative data that focuses on relationships between producers, development agencies, and Wal-Mart-owned supermarkets in Honduras, the research presented here demonstrates how, by introducing food safety standards to development agencies' outreach efforts, but without necessarily certifying producers or offering a price premium, Wal-Mart uses these standards to simultaneously differentiate production practices by promoting quality, while maintaining a standardized market. As a result, the responsibility and costs for incentivizing growers to change their practices is shifted to nongovernmental organizations. Therefore, although an extensive body of literature describes standards and third-party certification systems as the means for corporations to control production practices, this research indicates that public-private partnerships are a new vehicle by which corporations can influence agricultural production practices. In addition, this article argues that the inclusion of food safety standards in development projects leads to the conflation of food safety and sustainability, without adequately interrogating which agroecological processes food safety standards include and exclude. Therefore, retailers' private food safety standards dominate how sustainability is perceived and practiced in the development context.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Youth Family & Community Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Bloom, JD (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Youth Family & Community Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [1103180]; USDA's National Institute for Food and Agriculture [2011-67011-30760]; Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment; Pennsylvania State University College of Agricultural Sciences Graduate Research Award; NIFA [2011-67011-30760, 579295] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1103180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA's National Institute for Food and Agriculture; Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment; Pennsylvania State University College of Agricultural Sciences Graduate Research Award; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food & Agriculture); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Many thanks to those who provided helpful comments and feedback on earlier versions of this article including Clare Hinrichs, Jason Konefal, Daniel Tobin, Kristal Jones, and two anonymous reviewers.

The hidden costs and visible conflicts behind the Prosecco wine 'miracle',JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,,Article,,,,,,Value chains; Hidden costs; Conflict; Wine; Prosecco,GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; MARKETS; GEOGRAPHIES; NETWORKS; AREAS; POWER,"Prosecco, a wine that two decades ago was virtually unknown outside of Italy and was considered inferior to other sparkling wines, has become immensely popular. But how did Prosecco producers gear up to meet a booming demand in a highly regulated wine industry such as Italy's? Is this an example of an inclusive growth trajectory? Who is capturing the benefits of this growth and who is bearing its hidden costs? Through the case study of Prosecco, I identify the everyday practices and struggles that underpin the growth of Prosecco in relation to nature, landscape and land use, and examine how the environmental, health and other hidden costs of agrofood value chains shape various layers of visible conflict. The great growth that has characterized the 'Prosecco miracle' of the 2010s arises from the reinvention of a geographic origin that was under threat following the 2008 EU wine reform. The 'discovery' of a village named Prosecco, located quite far from the original core area of Prosecco production, provided the vector for a large expansion of Prosecco viticulture and wine production, and the emergence of a veritable export bubble. This expansion, supported by key institutions, regulators and the regional political elite, is putting pressure on nature and landscapes and is fomenting local protests against indiscriminate agro-chemical spraying. I find that, while the industry claims to be addressing its key sustainability challenges, a number of conflicts and tensions persist. Ultimately, the case study of Prosecco provides key insights to current debates on the hidden costs of agro-food value chains and their resulting conflicts - confirming that commodity expansion is often linked to processes of appropriation of nature, landscapes and territories, and to the ability of business to capture surplus while externalizing the hidden social, health and environmental costs of production.","[Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Ponte, Stefano] Univ Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa",Copenhagen Business School; University of Johannesburg,"Ponte, S (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",spo.msc@cbs.dk,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author would like to thank Hannah Elliot, Lisa Ann Richey and other participants of the CBDS paper development seminar (held at Copenhagen Business School on 16/4/2021) for their useful comments.

A UK-based review,JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM,,,,Article,,,,,,food tourism; agriculture; social capital; policy; United Kingdom,CULINARY TOURISM; DIVERSIFICATION; AUTHENTICITY,"This paper focuses on the role of food tourism in delivering sustainability agendas by examining how the agriculture and tourism sectors have struggled to realise measurable successes because of constraints, conflicting ambitions and low levels of social capital. It focuses on the United Kingdom, which has tasked regional development agencies to adopt food tourism as a means to grow local economies, create jobs and improve natural resources and diversify. In 2009/10, 16 interviews and six workshops were conducted with stakeholders to gauge industry challenges and needs in implementing food tourism. Based on qualitative findings, a model was developed which maps five emergent themes (knowledge exchange, the supply chain, fear of change, regionalisation and marketing) alongside five sustainability principles (strong and just society, good governance, sustainable economy, working within environmental limits and using sound science responsibly). The paper argues that if food tourism is to deliver its purported sustainable benefits, the policy environment must cultivate significant social capital through the cooperation of different industries with varying needs, motivations and challenges through joint marketing schemes, more localised distribution channels and enhanced policy engagement. Scotland and Wales are more successful than England, but overall food and tourism are not yet in effective partnership.","[Everett, Sally] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Lord Ashcroft Int Business Sch, Cambridge, England; [Slocum, Susan L.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Anglia Ruskin University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Everett, S (corresponding author), Anglia Ruskin Univ, Lord Ashcroft Int Business Sch, Cambridge, England.",everett_sally@hotmail.com,,,,,,,75,86,97,0,101,,,,0966-9582,1747-7646,,,,,2013,21,6,,,,,789,809,,10.1080/09669582.2012.741601,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2012.741601,,,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a compelling business case for ESG acceptance and integration; however, it is challenging to integrate ESG because there is no decision support tool for integrating ESG into the natural resource exploiting industry. This study applies the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) multicriteria decision-making method (MCDM) to develop a hierarchical decision support framework for integrating ESG into the natural resource industry. Twenty-five experts selected from multiple stakeholder groups in the natural resource industry evaluated a total of 3 main criteria and 25 sub-criteria identified through literature reviews and company sustainability reports. The results showed that E is the most important factor, followed by S and G. The overall top five sub-criteria include, Governance structure (G2), Emission (E1), Health and Safety (S1), the composition of the highest governance body and its committee (G6), and Risk Governance (G3). The results imply that managers should seek to integrate ESG into the natural resource industry for sustainable supply chain management because it has a strong potential to improve the credibility of their sustainability performance reporting. Again, managers and practitioners in the natural resource exploiting industry should sustain their environmental efforts, especially regarding emissions but should also consider energy issues and spills to improve the overall sustainability performance of the industry. Policymakers can consider implementing reporting and disclosure requirements that mandate natural resource extraction companies to provide transparent and comprehensive information on their ESG performance.","[Quayson, Matthew; Hu, Weihao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hi Tech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Quayson, Matthew] Ho Tech Univ, Dept Logist & Supply Chain Management, Ho, Ghana; [Bai, Chunguang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hi Tech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Mahmoudi, Amin] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei] Sichuan Mineral Resources Res Ctr, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Omoruyi, Osayuwamen] Sol Plaatje Univ, Sch Econ & Management Sci, Private Bag X5008, ZA-8300 Kimberley, South Africa",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Southeast University - China; Chengdu University of Technology,"Bai, CG (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave,West Hi Tech Zone, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",mquayson@htu.edu.gh; Cbai@uestc.edu.cn; pmp.mahmoudi@gmail.com; whu@uestc.edu.cn; osayuwamen.omoruyi@spu.ac.za,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72072021, 71772032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Funding This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 72072021 and 71772032.,,84,26,26,11,48,,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,AUG,2023,85,,A,,,,,,103988,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103988,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103988,,AUG 2023,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Bayesian network model is developed to assess the container shipping company's overall sustainability performance. Mitigation strategies are also designed. Theoretically, this research establishes a customised evaluation and mitigation framework for container shipping companies' sustainability risks considering a decision maker's risk appetite. The five most influential risks are 'weak organisational governance', 'insufficient seafarer training & education', 'weak social sustainability culture', 'maritime accident', and 'weak environmental sustainability culture'.

A systematic map,ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,,,,Article,,,,,,Voluntary sustainability standard; Sustainable fisheries; Market-based incentives; Impact evaluation; MSC,MSC CERTIFICATION; PRIVATE LABELS; FISHERIES; PERFORMANCE; ATTRIBUTES,"Background Voluntary Sustainability Standards and ecolabels are market-based mechanisms used to encourage producers and consumers toward environmental sustainability. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) aims to improve ocean health and promote a sustainable seafood market. There is growing interest in the program's impacts (direct and indirect) from changes to fisheries management and consumer awareness to market access and the reputation of fisheries. To better understand what is known about the program's impacts and the quality of evidence available, this map collates and describes articles on the environmental, social, institutional and economic effects of the MSC, identifying the methods used to determine impacts, and highlighting knowledge gaps and clusters. Methods Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches of peer-reviewed literature were conducted in Web of Science, SCOPUS and AGRIS. Grey literature was gathered from Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and three subject-specific websites. A total of 771 articles were retrieved, 271 of which were screened at full-text. 28 articles met all inclusion criteria and a further 37 met all the criteria but did not have a comparator. Additionally, 108 articles that describe the MSC but do not investigate its impacts (thus failing on 'comparator' and 'outcome' inclusion criteria) were included in the narrative report. This provides an overview of MSC topics that are of general interest to researchers in comparison to articles that investigate MSC's impact. Results Evidence of the impact of MSC certification fall in the following topic categories: economic (38%), environmental (25%), governance (29%) and social (8%). These articles documented diverse outcomes related to MSC certification. The most common are price premiums, market access, changes in stock health, ecosystem impacts and fisheries management changes. A key knowledge gap are articles on the effects of the MSC's Chain of Custody Standard and its effects on the supply chain. Generally, literature focused on European and North American fisheries with little focus on fisheries situated in lower-income countries. Conclusions Research interest in the MSC has grown over the last two decades, however, little research uses study designs and evidence that can robustly detect or attribute change to the MSC. Greater focus on conducting robust quasi-experimental designs would help to better understand the program effects. Comparing areas of interest in the general literature (which, for example, shows greater focus on the governance aspects of the programme than found in literature using comparators) suggests that this is partly due to lack of resources, data access and the challenge of obtaining counterfactuals. Nevertheless, some topics were absent in all areas, such as the social and economic dynamics that link harvesters and supply chain actors. It is important to fill the identified knowledge gaps as the behaviours of certified harvesters, supply chain actors and other stakeholders are the key through which the public influence sustainability, market inclusion/exclusion operates, and inequality is generated. Understanding these processes can have wider relevance in the field, informing the design of other sustainability interventions.","[Arton, Ashleigh; Longo, Catherine S.] Marine Stewardship Council, Sci & Stand, London, England; [Leiman, Anthony] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Petrokofsky, Gillian] Univ Oxford, Biodivers Inst, Long Term Ecol & Resource Stewardship Lab, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Toonen, Hilde] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Cape Town; University of Oxford; Wageningen University & Research,"Arton, A (corresponding author), Marine Stewardship Council, Sci & Stand, London, England.",Ashleigh.Arton@msc.org,,,MSC,MSC,"AA and CL are employees of the MSC and as such receive salaries from the organisation that is the focus of this systematic map protocol.

By recycling rare earth resources from obsolete equipment, the reliance on newly mined rare earth resources can be reduced, thereby reducing the related environmental and energy footprints and increasing the stability of the supply chain. This study aims to systematically and strategically analyze and discuss the recycling impacts of renewable energy generation (REG)-related rare earth resources in terms of environmental, economic, social, and governance aspects. A SWOT strategical analysis framework integrating a management cycle and intelligent text data mining is built to address the above tasks from an ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) perspective. The SWOT analysis of the rare earth recycling impacts focuses on strengths (e.g., reduced dependence on rare resources, reduced environmental and emission pressure), weaknesses (e.g., high cost, technology and management complexity), opportunities (e.g., policy support, technological innovations, diversification of the global supply chain), and threats (e.g., market volatility, the emergence of alternative materials). This analysis framework reveals textual topic changes and suggests cyclic and strategical improvement pathways to analyze the multi-dimensional recycling impacts. The text data analysis results indicate that the trend of rare earth recycling is gradually transformed from technologies, supply and demand, and secondary resources into resource and environment sustainable development. Beyond overcoming identified challenges, future pathways should focus more on the integration of advanced emerging technologies, life cycle management, and dynamic adjustment of recycling strategies. This study could provide policymakers and industry practitioners with recommendations and outlook on current development status and improvement strategies to promote REG-related rare earth recycling.","[Zhang, Lei; Jiang, Peng; Zhang, Yibo] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Van Fan, Yee] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst ECI, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; University of Oxford; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Jiang, P (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",pengjiang@scu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [72474149, 72088101, 72061127004]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1908501]; Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province [2024NSFSC1081]",National Natural Science Founda-tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China (Grant No. 72474149, 72088101 and 72061127004) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFC1908501) , and the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (Grant No. 2024NSFSC1081) .

Based on the panel data of 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China from 2000 to 2019, spatial Dubin model (SDM) is used to analyze the influence of agricultural economic growth and other factors on planting non-point source pollution. Innovate from the perspective of research objects and research methods, and the research results show (1) In the past 20 years, the amount of fertilizer applied and crop straw yield increased continuously. Through the fertilizer and farmland solid waste discharge of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), calculation of the equal-standard discharges of planting non-point source pollution shows that China's planting non-point source pollution is serious. Among the investigated areas in 2019, the equal-standard discharges of planting non-point source pollution in Heilongjiang Province were the highest and have reached 24.35 x 10(10) m(3). (2) The global Moran index of 20 years in the study area shows obvious spatial aggregation and diffusion characteristics, and has a significant positive global spatial autocorrelation, indicating that planting non-point source pollution discharges of the study area have potential interdependence in space. (3) SDM time-fixed effect model showed that the equal-standard discharges of planting non-point source pollution had a significant negative spatial spillover effect, and the spatial lag coefficient was - 0.11. Among the influencing factors, agricultural economic growth, technological progress, financial support to agriculture level, consumption capacity, industrial structure, and risk perception have significant spatial spillover effects on planting non-point source pollution. The results of effect decomposition show that the positive spatial spillover effect of agricultural economic growth on adjacent areas is greater than the negative effect on the local area. Based on the analysis of significant influencing factors, the paper provides direction guidance for the formulation of planting non-point source pollution control policy.","[Li, Xin; Shang, Jie] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Northeast Forestry University - China,"Li, X (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",hello_o_o@nefu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation [71573036]; National Social Science Fund: Research on the coupling of blockchain technology and agricultural ecological products supply chain governance [20FGLB059],National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund: Research on the coupling of blockchain technology and agricultural ecological products supply chain governance,This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation Project: Farmers' behavior of fertilizer application and agricultural non-point source pollution control: impact mechanism and policy simulation research (71573036) and National Social Science Fund: Research on the coupling of blockchain technology and agricultural ecological products supply chain governance (20FGLB059).,,49,12,13,13,96,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,APR,2023,30,18,,,,,51607,51623,,10.1007/s11356-023-25929-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-25929-2,,FEB 2023,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Utilizing a concise empirical framework, our findings substantiate the catalytic role of China's ETS in reducing ESG greenwashing activities. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation varies depending on firm's size, governance quality, and pollution nature. Notably, the impact of the ETS also differs based on cohort, calendar times, and exposure duration. Furthermore, our analysis explores the complex mechanisms through which ETS influences ESG greenwashing across four key dimensions, revealing that factors like innovation (including R&D and green innovation) and supply chain dynamics enhance the scheme's ability to curb greenwashing. Conversely, financial constraints and the digital divide can undermine the effectiveness of China's ETS, potentially leading to increased greenwashing practices.","[Tao, Miaomiao; Poletti, Stephen] Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Energy Ctr, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Policy, Sch Management, Fujian 361005, Peoples R China",University of Auckland; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Policy, Sch Management, Fujian 361005, Peoples R China.",tao.miaomiao@auckland.ac.nz; bqlin@xmu.edu.cn; s.poletti@auckland.ac.nz,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72133003],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program, No 72133003) .",,53,2,2,58,61,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,NOV,2024,370,,,,,,,,122681,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122681,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122681,,OCT 2024,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While connecting value-related success to financial performance is a niche field among academicians and researchers, the debate is still on Does it matter the going value of non-financial disclosures (NFD) relevant? To clarify ambiguous perceptions in existing literature, we examine how NFD connects to sustainable development by conducting an in-depth scientometric analysis to gain insights into evolution, trends, and other multi-dimensional aspects to map centralities and bursts in non-financial sustain -ability indicators. We used bibliometric data from a pool of 1568 studies from Web of Science published in Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) journals between 1991 and 2021 to identify the prominent research areas in this stream and the pattern of the interrelationship among various disciplines. The current investigation reveals several novel features of ESG disclosures, such as corporate sus-tainable performance, environmental performance, environmental disclosures, sustainable supply chains, sus-tainability indicators, and integrated reporting. This study highlights bottlenecks and suggests the scope of future research on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) to meet sustainable business goals. The findings of this study include 13 major clusters refining ESG for sustainability, concluding with a new theory encapsulating sustainable development through non-financial disclosure in business processes.

Therefore, the research problem seeks to explore How do socio-economic challenges, financial inequities, and traditional practices in the rural gem mining industry of Passara, and Lunugala in Badulla district hinder its contribution to sustainable development and equitable growth?. Hence, the objectives of this study are two-fold: firstly, to identify the socio-economic challenges faced by workers and owners in the rural gem mining industry of Passara, and Lunugala. Secondly, to investigate financial disparities and power dynamics between investors/ owners and workers in the gem mining sector, focusing on their impact on sustainable development. The research adopts a qualitative approach, employing interpretivism and inductive reasoning to assess the experiences, challenges, and aspirations of five investors/owners and fifteen workers in gem mining. The findings highlight critical socio-economic hurdles, financial disparities between owners and workers, and the need for policy interventions to foster equitable growth and environmental sustainability.

Uniform implementation of the BMPs poses a challenge if most of the shrimp farms in a given region are small (<2 ha). The adoption of BMPs and the associated economics were studied in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, the state that leads India's shrimp production. The overall rate of adoption was approximately 73%. Using factor analysis, all the partly adopted BMPs were categorized into six thematic factors: optimized input supply, improved management practices, routine maintenance, social responsibility, group approach, and culture-system-related and other practices. The ordinary least square regression model explained the factors that influenced the decision to adopt a given practice. These factors included key socio-economic variables such as age, education, and membership of farmers associations. Partial budget analysis revealed that adopting all the recommended BMPs in full would decrease the net returns from each crop by 16.6%. Although adopting the BMPs is voluntary, the practices crucial to the success of a crop were adopted by all the farmers (almost as if it were mandatory to adopt them), whereas those that involved significant costs were left out. Although small farmers can be persuaded to adopt the BMPs through awareness programmes, upgrading their holdings to a size at which a standardized farming system is feasible needs substantial investment. The governments of shrimp-exporting nations should improve their regulatory structure to embrace an inclusive governance model involving all the key actors in the value chain to make the small scale shrimp farming sustainable.

The emergence of complex global value chains (GVCs) in recent decades, in which a country can operate as both a consumer and producer simulta-neously, has led to a further rise in emissions. The complexity of these GVCs makes it increasingly difficult to determine what country is responsible for the emissions embodied within them. Here, we propose a new method based on input-output analysis to identify and distinguish self-and shared responsibility for CO2 emissions along GVCs, where self-responsibility describes emissions embodied in purely domestic value chains. Our results show that developing countries' self-responsibility for CO2 emissions has been the largest driver in the growth of total GVC embodied emissions since 2001. Even considering the shared responsibility for emission transfers via GVCs, developing countries' total responsibility has exceeded that of developed countries since 2012. We argue that climate negotiations should seriously consider GVC-based responsibility sharing to enable more effective climate policies.","[Meng, Bo] Japan External Trade Org, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Meng, Bo] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Ind Dev & Environm Governance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Meng, Bo] Tokyo Fdn Policy Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Liu, Yu] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yuning] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Meng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhi] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Arlington, VA USA; [Xue, Jinjun] Nagoya Univ, SinoCarbon Carbon Neutral Innovat Joint Lab, Nagoya, Japan; [Andrew, Robbie] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, Oslo, Norway; [Feng, Kuishuang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD USA; [Qi, Ye] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yongping] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst State Governance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Meng, Bo; Xue, Jinjun; Sun, Yongping; Wang, Keying] Hubei Univ Econ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Emiss Trading Syst Coconstr, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Huaping] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Huaping] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Peking University; Tsinghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; George Mason University; Nagoya University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Hubei University of Economics; China University of Geosciences; Jiangsu University,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Gao, YN (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, M (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",yu.liu@pku.edu.cn; gao_yuning@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; mengli2010@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"IDE-JETRO's project Global Value Chains in Transition III [ROB220422006]; University of International Business and Economics, China [20K01674, 20KK0033]; Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China [21AZD067]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72125010, 71974186, 71873075, 72204159, 72074069, 71733002]; Center for Industrial Development and Environmental Governance (CIDEG) 's main project Tracing China's CO2 Emissions in Global Supply Chains; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20KK0033, 20K01674] Funding Source: KAKEN","IDE-JETRO's project Global Value Chains in Transition III; University of International Business and Economics, China; Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Industrial Development and Environmental Governance (CIDEG) 's main project Tracing China's CO2 Emissions in Global Supply Chains; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research is supported by the following projects: IDE-JETRO's project Global Value Chains in Transition III (no.

In doing so, I make two contributions. The first is empirical: documenting this exploratory campaign and mapping activist strategies and outcomes against the gold production network. The second is theoretical: evaluating whether the GPN toolkit can help explain how the nature of a commodity and its markets impact activist strategies and outcomes. Recasting industries as sites of social struggle, a GPN approach offers a more nuanced understanding of the power permeating markets than more conventional supply chain analyses. The results clarify the challenges activists face when politicising industries by targeting brands, particularly in the extractives sector. But the findings also illuminate opportunities, including the more subtle pathways of activist influence as they: (1) gather and disseminate information, (2) place social and environmental issues on the industry agenda, (3) spur industry to create institutions around these issues, (4) insert themselves and their agenda into the production network, and (5) form alliances with industry actors pushing for change.","[Bloomfield, Michael John] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Int Dev, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Bloomfield, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Int Dev, Bath, Avon, England.",m.j.bloomfield@bath.ac.uk,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [752-2009-0713],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 752-2009-0713].,,68,16,18,1,13,,,,1356-3467,1469-9923,,,,,2017,22,6,,,,,727,742,,10.1080/13563467.2017.1321624,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2017.1321624,,,,Economics; International Relations; Political Science,,Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

By exploring potential mechanisms, this study confirms that the promotion effect of the manager's green experience on corporate carbon emission performance is driven by higher green attention and a larger scale of green investment. Heterogenous tests show that the impact of the manager's green experience on carbon emission is diluted in state-owned enterprises, companies with better corporate governance, and regions with stronger environmental regulation.

Unfortunately, supplier diversity programs have been hindered by less than wholehearted buyer adoption and stakeholder engagement. The original scoping of supplier diversity also holds limitations when comparing to the multidimensionality of the diversity and inclusion concept. The purpose of this article is to share lessons learned from the development of an innovative supplier diversity program by Moet Hennessy aimed at more sustainably scoping, scaling and stimulating supplier diversity programs.Design/methodology/approachThe development and the design of Moet Hennessy's supplier diversity program is presented. The design was informed, and partially supported by, a collaboration with the author. Critical reflections on pitfalls and outstanding questions are developed based upon the program design.FindingsMoet Hennessy developed a supplier diversity program that is more comprehensively defined, targets a more global scale and includes innovative stakeholder engagement techniques such as the development of supplier diversity champions in the business. The program also is embedded in existing environmental social and governance initiatives.Originality/valueMoet Hennessy's supplier diversity program was not mandated by one of its customers but sourced from an academic collaboration and stimulated by competitive opportunity. The program was designed bottoms up, not top down. The program is sponsored outside of procurement and has champions throughout the business. The program expands beyond the traditional scoping of supplier diversity programs. Pathways and pitfalls for managers are identified based upon insights from Moet Hennessy's experience. These inform suggestions for further research.","[van Hoek, Remko] Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, SCM Dept, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Lebigot, Dominique] LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Paris, France; [Bagot, Antoine; Sexton, Shannon] Moet Hennessy, New York, NY USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"van Hoek, R (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Sam M Walton Coll Business, SCM Dept, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",rvanhoek@uark.edu,,,,,,,21,4,4,5,11,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,MAY 31,2024,29,3,,,SI,,460,467,,10.1108/SCM-01-2023-0041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-01-2023-0041,,SEP 2023,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Second, this study focuses on the moderating effects of internal and external pressures. Confucian culture and public pressure hinder the positive effects of AI, while technological proficiency and data security awareness amplify this positive impact. Finally, this study explores the potential pathways of AI based on corporate resource allocation and stakeholders. AI achieves corporate sustainable development by alleviating financing constraints, reducing agency costs, improving supply chain performance, labor productivity, resource utilization efficiency, and reducing corporate risks.

Based on a literature review, there have been almost no direct relationships between the I4-Food-Agriculture (I4FA) Nexus and the agroecosystem. This study aimed to evaluate the state-of-the-art relationships between the I4FA Nexus and the agroecosystem and to discuss the challenges in the sustainable FAI that can be assisted by the I4 technologies. This objective was fulfilled by (a) reviewing all the relevant publications and (b) drawing a conceptual relationship between the I4FA Nexus and the agroecosystem, in which the I4FA Nexus is categorized into socio-economic and environmental (SEE) perspectives. Four points are highlighted in the present review. First, I4 technology is projected to grow in the agricultural and food sectors today and in the future. Second, food agriculture output may benefit from I4 by considering the SEE benefits. Third, implementing I4 is a challenging journey for the sustainable FAI, especially for the small to medium enterprises (SMEs). Fourth, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles can help to manage I4's implementation in agriculture and food. The advantages of I4 deployment include (a) social benefits like increased occupational safety, workers' health, and food quality, security, and safety; (b) economic benefits, like using sensors to reduce agricultural food production costs, and the food supply chain; and (c) environmental benefits like reducing chemical leaching and fertilizer use. However, more studies are needed to address social adaptability, trust, privacy, and economic income uncertainty, especially in SMEs or in businesses or nations with lower resources; this will require time for adaptation to make the transition away from human ecology. For agriculture to be ESG-sustainable, the deployment of I4FA could be an answer with the support of an open-minded dialogue platform with ESG-minded leaders to complement sustainable agroecosystems on a global scale.","[Yap, Chee Kong] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Mutairi, Khalid Awadh] Univ Tabuk, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, POB 741, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of Tabuk,"Yap, CK (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",yapchee@upm.edu.my; kmutairi@ut.edu.sa,,,,,,,225,5,5,18,47,,,,,2304-8158,,,,JAN,2024,13,1,,,,,,,150,10.3390/foods13010150,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods13010150,,,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,"gold, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because the metals industry has been less likely to report engagement with the SDGs than other sectors, exploring its relationship with the SDGs is essential in accelerating its engagement with these goals. This study examines the relationship between the metals industry and the SDGs by analyzing reports of 61 metal companies. The analysis adopts the number of activities associated with SDGs as a proxy indicator in measuring the intensity of association between the company and 17 SDGs. The results show that the metals industry places most focus on SDGs 8, 3, and 12, but its activities are less associated with SDGs 14, 2, and 1 on the whole. Furthermore, this relationship with the SDGs shows different trends among metal producers: the steel industry places great weight on SDG 12 and less on SDGs 1 and 2, whereas the copper industry recognizes the relevance to SDGs 1 and 2. This is attributed to the different positions of the production companies in the supply chain because current SDG reporting seems to be strongly affected by the circumstances and stakeholders they face directly. For further commitment to the SDGs, these findings recommend that metal producers consider the values and benefits that the metals provide throughout the value chain. This study is of value in increasing knowledge about the metal industry's strengths and weaknesses within the SDG framework and suggests future involvement.","[Hatayama, Hiroki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, 16-1 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST),"Hatayama, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, 16-1 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan.",h-hatayama@aist.go.jp,,,,,,,39,31,32,8,65,,,,0921-3449,1879-0658,,,,MAR,2022,178,,,,,,,,106081,10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.106081,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.106081,,,,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We developed a series of hypotheses and a questionnaire to achieve the aims of the study. The partial least-squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the cause-effect relationship arising from the hypotheses. The results show contractual and relational governances affect BCI positively. Contractual governance, which consists of monitoring elements in safeguarding provisions, positively affect BCI and project performance. However, there is no effect found for safeguarding provisions that define the rights of parties in the contract.

The transition to low-carbon economies invokes a host of multiscalar dilemmas, injustices and trade-offs, notably between the global imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the local consequences of mineral mining. There are profound barriers to delivering a just energy transition at a planetary scale given the reliance of green technologies upon socio-environmentally harmful extractive practices across critical mineral supply chains. Adopting an interdisciplinary lens and drawing from a set of international case studies, we critically examine the intersection of critical minerals with just transition governance and explore possibilities for more plural, holistic and integrated just energy transition pathways. In this introduction article, we detail the ways in which the production of low-carbon technologies is bound up with global inequalities and ongoing coloniality. We then demonstrate the importance of adopting a global, inclusive outlook on just energy transitions.

The moderating role played by the top management commitment is further examined. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses alongside Hayes' PROCESS to check moderation effects. Results from a survey of 637 employees working in Small-and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) of Indian manufacturing firms indicate that EMPs result into increased environmental as well as financial performance of the firm. It was also found that energy efficiency mediates the relationship between the adoption of EMPs and environmental performance, amplified by top management commitment.

We extend the green economy concept by including the landscape as the provider of social, economic and environmental values. Our aim is to explore how companies could engage in creating landscape-inclusive solutions for sustainable landscapes. We propose a conceptual model of the relationship between companies and landscape services based on a demand for landscape benefits by companies, implications for wider society. We present a short overview of how scientists addressed the role of companies in landscape-inclusive solutions. We also give some examples taken from the World Wide Web to illustrate the variety of ways in which companies already invest in landscape services. Our findings suggest that the relationship between companies and landscapes is not yet strongly recognized in sustainability science. However, examples from practice show that some companies do recognize the added values of landscape services, to the extent that they invest in landscape management. We conclude that future research should provide information on the added value of landscape-inclusive solutions to companies, and increase their capacity to engage in regional social-ecological networks.","[Opdam, Paul; Steingrover, Eveliene] Wageningen Environm Res Alterra, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Opdam, Paul] Wageningen Univ, Land Use Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Opdam, P (corresponding author), Wageningen Environm Res Alterra, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.;Opdam, P (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Land Use Planning Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",paul.opdam@wur.nl; eveliene.steingrover@wur.nl,,,"TopsectorWater Programme - Dutch national government; Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality","TopsectorWater Programme - Dutch national government; Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality","The authors wish to thank the members of the Nature as Partner working group and the Green Circle inspiration group for their help and suggestions, especially with the conceptual model (Figure 2).

We employ the two-step system generalized method of moments (Sys-GMM) estimator to examine the relationship between CEO power and CDI and the mediating role of FRQ. We utilize a dataset of Vietnamese listed firms between 2015 and 2022, totalling 494 firm-year observations. We further perform a battery of robustness tests. We find that CEO power positively influences CDI, indicating that CEOs may enhance transparency to bolster their reputation. However, our results also reveal a negative impact of CEO power on FRQ, supporting the notion that powerful CEOs might prioritize personal interests at the expense of reporting integrity. Additionally, we demonstrate that FRQ mediates the relationship between CEO power and CDI, suggesting that while CEOs promote environmental disclosure' transparency, they may concurrently engage in earnings management practices that diminish FRQ. This research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the role of CEO power in facilitating both financial and environmental disclosures in an emerging market context. The study highlights the mediating role of FRQ, offering new insights into the governance mechanisms that influence corporate transparency.","[Khuong, Nguyen Vinh; Tai, Vu Tran Trong] Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Khuong, Nguyen Vinh; Tai, Vu Tran Trong] Vietnam Natl Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Anh, Le Huu Tuan] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Australia",Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) System; VNU-HCM University of Economics & Law (VNUHCM-UEL); Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) System; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Khuong, NV (corresponding author), Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Khuong, NV (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",khuongnv@uel.edu.vn; letuananh2512000@gmail.com,,,Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) [B2024-34-01],Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM),This research is funded by Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) under Grant Number B2024-34-01.,,139,0,0,1,1,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,2025 FEB 10,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/bse.4196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.4196,,FEB 2025,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Covering a total of 100 energy firms including electricity generation and mining from 2014 to 2016, this study observes that CSR significantly affects stock price crash risk in the energy industry, as employee protection, environmental protection, product quality control, consumers' right protection, and supply chain partners all significantly reduce an energy firm's stock price crash risk. We also employ the industry as our moderator to test whether different sub-industries have varying correlations between CSR and stock price crash risk, finding that the electricity generation firms with higher CSR scores especially in environmental protection, promoting technology innovation, and corporate image have significantly lower stock price crash risk, while the mining firms do not. These results suggest that compared to other CSR items, investors should pay more attention on pollution improvement and trading provisions that decrease this risk more effectively, especially in the electricity generation industry.","[Wu, Chia-Ming; Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, 118,Sect 1,Chung Hsiao W Rd, Taipei 10044, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Hu, JL (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, 118,Sect 1,Chung Hsiao W Rd, Taipei 10044, Taiwan.",cmwu.bm01g@nctu.edu.tw; jinlihu@mail.nctu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST107-2410-H-009-035]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are grateful to an anonymous referee and a senior editor of this journal for their valuable comments.

As share ownership becomes increasingly concentrated, and the market for Environmental, Social and Governance investment products grows, these investors are increasingly involved in governing the activities of publicly traded corporations (including leading agribusinesses). This paper brings together political economy and marketization studies research to explore how universal owners become concerned about particular environmental and ethical problems, why they overlook other public concerns, and in what ways their selective engagement with ethico-political issues might be altering the content of food politics. Comparing universal owners' engagements with farm animal welfare issues and with tropical deforestation within animal feed supply chains, we argue that these institutions engage with tropical deforestation because it presents a financially material risk to firms across multiple industries. By contrast, the specificity of farm animal welfare issues to agribusinesses means that they do not pose a material risk to the overall performance of universal owners' highly diversified asset portfolios. Efforts to concern universal owners about livestock agriculture's social, environmental and health impacts thus generate a food politics which focuses primarily on risks to global economic systems and renders animals themselves distinctly immaterial.","[Brice, Jeremy] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Brice, Jeremy] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Cusworth, George; Garnett, Tara] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Lorimer, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Hertford Coll, Oxford, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Brice, J (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.;Brice, J (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",jeremy.brice@manchester.ac.uk,,,"Wellcome Trust, Our Planet Our Health (Livestock, Environment and People - LEAP) [205212/Z/16/Z]","Wellcome Trust, Our Planet Our Health (Livestock, Environment and People - LEAP)(Wellcome Trust)","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust, Our Planet Our Health (Livestock, Environment and People -LEAP) (grant number 205212/Z/16/Z).",,49,5,5,3,28,,,,0308-518X,1472-3409,,,,NOV,2022,54,8,,,,,1551,1568,,10.1177/0308518X221121132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X221121132,,AUG 2022,,Environmental Studies; Geography,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ethnography analyses cooperation networks between organic food producers' and consumers' involving different nodes of community gardening initiatives, self-employed growers, local farmers and all of them under a unique cooperative integrating a community economy. The result it is a myriad of exchange practices ranging from reciprocity and barter to market exchange without intermediaries through on-line platforms. Along these exchanges different options of currency intervene giving rise to novel social and cooperative relations. Similar initiatives in Norway show less variation and are less experimental regarding forms of payment but share similarities in relation to material articulations, concerns and forms of alternative practice. Although these novel forms do not represent a complete break from the more standardized supply chains, and hence from the oppositions/contradictions of production and consumption, the participants see themselves as contributing to a more general process of de-commodification of food. We explore the extent to which the meaning and moral values are mutually constituted in relation to socioeconomic exchanges and environmental caring that each person experiences based on different forms of cooperation and reciprocity. Food, we suggest, is more than a commodity on the market that we may influence through our role as consumers. It is a significant focal point connecting our lives to those of others that articulates one's relations to society in a political manner.","[Gomez Mestres, S.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Bldg B, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Lien, Marianne E.] Univ Oslo, Dept Social Anthropol, POB 1091, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Oslo,"Mestres, SG (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Bldg B, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain.",silvia.gomez@uab.cat; m.e.lien@sai.uio.no,,,"program NILS Science and Sustainability, ABEL Individual Mobility of Researchers [012-ABEL-IM-2014]","program NILS Science and Sustainability, ABEL Individual Mobility of Researchers","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2017 Sovereignty, Contestation and 'the Economy'/Sharing economies and the commons International Conference organized by SOSCO (Research Group Sovereignty and Social Contestation) at Utrecht University, the Netherlands.

This study identifies the highest priority sustainability indicators for the New Zealand wine industry using materiality analysis. Thirteen information sources representative of different stakeholder perspectives considered to drive the need for sustainability assessment are analysed to provide a measure of sustainability issue salience and risk. Based on a meta-analysis of relevant information, it is found that environmental issues make up the highest priority issues, followed by social issues relating primarily to worker wellbeing. Significantly, economic and governance issues were not found to be high priorities. These findings are discussed in the context of the common bias in agricultural sustainability assessment towards environmental issues, and the broader business implications for sustainability assessment, strategy and policy.

This article examines the role of global financial networks in articulating the nexus and in connecting it to sustainability programs. It provides new insights into critical engagements with the nexus that, to date, have focused predominantly on water security and governance. The article examines how global financial networks conceptualized and concretized the nexus towards two ends: First, the nexus was used to effect the transition from state-oriented development models to financialized approaches of water development and sustainability. Here, the nexus was formulated in critique of, and as a solution to, the previously dominant approach to water development: integrated water resources management (IWRM). Second, the nexus was deployed to connect water, energy, food, and climate to the global economy in terms of complex systems. The identification of risks to the resilience of environmental and economic systems provided a new form of integration across the supply chains affected by the governance and security of water, energy, food, and climate. In both cases, the nexus mobilizes technologies of global finance, such as credit-risk ratings, to construct and defend new strategies for governing water security and to enable sub-sovereign actors, such as municipalities, to be incorporated into the global economy. The paper concludes that alignments of the nexus with sustainability programs, and the Sustainable Development Goals, must be reconsidered in view of the constraints posed by financial orientations towards the risks and resilience of economic and environmental systems.","[Schmidt, Jeremy J.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England",Durham University; University of London; King's College London,"Schmidt, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",jeremy.schmidt@durham.ac.uk; nathanial.matthews@kcl.ac.uk,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors thank Harriet Bulkeley, Kathryn Furlong, Sohini Kar, Pablo Mendez, and the anonymous reviewers for thoughtful comments on previous iterations of the paper.

In the narrative of telecoupling, the land disturbance caused by economy-wide international trade has been widely addressed using a multi-regional input-output analysis, but not sufficiently considering the telecoupled land use associated with a specific manufactured product. In this study, using the total material requirement, a new methodology is proposed for evaluating telecoupled land disturbances induced by manufacturing a given product in a given country. This product-focused method is a hybrid approach based on the integration of inventory data of a given product (bottom-up) and the global trade database (top-down). The developed methodology was applied to evaluate the multi-regional land disturbances induced by the production of gasoline vehicles (GVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in Japan, as a case study. Finally, the implication is further discussed from the perspective of supply risk, governance, and corporate social responsibility. It was found that the transition of automobile technology in Japan results in changes in the countries and regions most exposed to the telecoupled land disturbances: i.e., from Australia (26% for GVs) to Chile (27% for BEVs) and South Africa (20% for FCVs). The algorithm developed is relatively simplified so that it can be readily implemented to determine the telecoupled land disturbances associated with any product in any country for a sustainable interaction in their mineral trade with other distant countries and regions.","[Kosai, Shoki] Ritsumeikan Univ, Global Innovat Res Org, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Liao Hanqing; Zhang, Zhengyang; Matsubae, Kazuyo] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Yamasue, Eiji] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan",Ritsumeikan University; Tohoku University; Ritsumeikan University,"Kosai, S (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Global Innovat Res Org, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",kosai@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,"KAKENHI Grants [20K12272, 20K20013, 19H04329]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [S-16]; Ritsumeikan University Fund (R-GIRO); JST-Mirai Program [JPMJMI21I5]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K20013, 20K12272, 19H04329] Funding Source: KAKEN","KAKENHI Grants(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Ritsumeikan University Fund (R-GIRO); JST-Mirai Program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was partly supported by research funds from KAKENHI Grants (20K12272, 20K20013 and 19H04329) , from the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-16) , from Ritsumeikan University Fund (R-GIRO) , and from JST-Mirai Program (JPMJMI21I5) .",,106,8,8,2,52,,,,0921-3449,1879-0658,,,,MAR,2022,178,,,,,,,,106093,10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.106093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.106093,,,,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We review zero-deforestation commitments, and the peer-reviewed and gray literature, to characterize the role of these commitments in protecting and enhancing the well-being of indigenous and traditional forest-dependent people, laborers, and smallholders. First, we find that social criteria in zero-deforestation commitments pertain to labor standards, land rights, and community consultation. Second, we find that few publications examine the impacts of zero-deforestation commitments on social outcomes. Of those few, most are gray literature reports that rely on field-intensive data-collection to evaluate compliance with social criteria. Third, we highlight opportunities for linking zero-deforestation commitments to certification programs, and for developing jurisdictional approaches to sustainable sourcing.

The results indicate that sustainability practices significantly affect offshoring activities of MNCs. In particular, we found that sustainable business practices matter when the firm sells goods or owns assets in the given host nation.

To promote food safety supervision in the Chinese agricultural markets under the background of blockchain application, this paper develops a partnership comprising vendors, consumers, and the government. Using the theory of evolutionary game combined with the actual situation of China, the evolutionary process simulations of three participants prove that the tripartite subjects can realize a stable state under the specific relationship. Impact investigation results of typical influential factors indicate the following: (1) The behavior of vendors depends on the government's supervision and consumers' reporting attitude. Limiting the penalty amount for vendors to 66.7% of speculative gains can shorten the processing time for vendors to comply with the law. (2) Consumers play a vital role in food safety supervision of the agricultural market. The penalty for consumers should be limited to 1/3 of the reward amount. (3) The government's incentive-oriented and punishment-inhibited policies can promote blockchain technology in supervision. Punishment-inhibited and key influencing parameters can cooperate in obtaining the maximum regulatory benefits.

Fashion industry has undergone public analysis, facing demands for greater transparency about environmental and social sustainability. The growing public awareness of sustainability issues has led firms to declare their commitment to sustainable resources, but few changes have been registered. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe listed technological innovation as a key tool for making the fashion industry transparent and traceable regarding sustainability and circularity. The research and responsible innovation framework indicate appropriate ways to manage innovation from a responsible and ethical perspective, according to ethical corporate behaviour (ECB), particularly in the industries characterized by productive phases processed in more countries, such as the fashion industry. However, the linkages between responsible innovation, ECB towards innovative and sustainable business models, and their conceptualization, are still unclear in the fashion industry, achieving the goals included in the UN 2030 Agenda. This study draws on bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on 114 articles published between 1990 and 2021 allows to identify the above issues in the research domains, and outline the evolutionary trajectories, as well as to explore the literary corpus about responsible innovation (RI) in the ethical corporate behaviour (ECB) of the fashion industry and its Asian suppliers. The results highlight that fashion brands strive to develop RI and ECB along their supply chain. Still, the misalignment of corporate ethics and cultural values represents a significant obstacle to the adoption of business models, especially to achieve the goals of UN 2030 Agenda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that discusses RI as enabling driver in the ECB for fashion companies also defining a future research agenda including RI, ECB, iSBMs towards SDGs.","[Di Vaio, Assunta; D'Amore, Gabriella] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Hassan, Rohail] Univ Utara Malaysia UUM, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business OYAGSB, Kuala Lumpur 50300, Malaysia; [Tiscini, Riccardo] Mercatorum Univ Rome, Piazza Mattel 10, I-00186 Rome, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Di Vaio, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",susy.divaio@uniparthenope.it,,,Universita Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Universita Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by Universita Parthenope di Napoli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,164,25,25,15,111,,,,0217-4561,1572-9958,,,,SEP,2024,41,3,,,SI,,1129,1173,,10.1007/s10490-022-09844-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10490-022-09844-7,,AUG 2022,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that the family effect on firm environmental management practices ranges substantially, from extremely negative to no effect at all. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect depends on the type of firm, the industrial context, the type of economy, and the stages of the business cycle. This study offers a novel understanding of the extreme heterogeneity of environmental management practices of family businesses and serves as a springboard for future research aiming to better understand the environmental strategies of publicly traded firms with concentrated ownership structures. It also provides important and novel evidence for policymakers, investors, and business owners, particularly for firms with different ownership and management structures. Environmental management practices have been playing an increasingly prominent role in business strategy. However, in facing climate change and global warming, family firms, with their idiosyncratic characteristics, may react in unique ways. We have conducted an international study of 1690 family and nonfamily firms from 2007 to 2014 and found that environmental management practices vary substantially across different types of family firms, which tend to be over-represented among groups with both the poorest and most superior outcomes. We argue that family firm managers and consultants should consider strengthening the environmental pillar of strategy to keep up with competitors and become green champions. Moreover, regulators should consider family governance tendencies in establishing more stringent environmental policies and regulations, particularly in low-income countries and problematic concentrated industries. Investors too must pay attention to firm ownership and ownership structure in evaluating environmentally related business opportunities.","[Miroshnychenko, Ivan] Int Inst Management Dev, Ch Bellerive 23,POB 915, CH-1001 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Miller, Danny] HEC Montreal, Ctr Res Org Strategy & Governance, Chemin Cote St Catherine 3000, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [De Massis, Alfredo] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Ctr Family Business Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [De Massis, Alfredo] IMD, Lausanne, Switzerland; [De Massis, Alfredo] Univ Lancaster, Dept Entrepreneurship Strategy & Innovat, Management Sch, Lancaster, England; [Le Breton-Miller, Isabelle] HEC Montreal, Dept Management, Chemin Cote St Catherine 3000, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",International Institute for Management Development (IMD); Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; International Institute for Management Development (IMD); Lancaster University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"De Massis, A (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Ctr Family Business Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",alfredo.demassis@unibz.it,,,Libera Universit di Bolzano; Annual European Academy of Management (EURAM) in Canada; Annual International Family Enterprise Research Academy,Libera Universit di Bolzano; Annual European Academy of Management (EURAM) in Canada; Annual International Family Enterprise Research Academy,"We benefited from the comments of participants at the 81st Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management (AOM) in the USA, the Annual European Academy of Management (EURAM) in Canada, the Annual International Family Enterprise Research Academy (IFERA) in Spain, and the Business and Society Research Seminar in Belgium.

Thus, supplier dependence is particularly critical to the supplier's CSR, especially for Chinese suppliers with resource constraints. However, there is limited understanding and research on the degree to which a supplier depends on major buyers for the supplier's CSR from the supplier's perspective. Based on a sample of 284 Chinese listed companies, this study analyses the relationship between supplier dependence and suppliers' CSR through the lens of resource dependence theory (RDT). In addition, we investigate the moderating roles of industrial dynamism and corporate transparency in the relationship between supplier dependence and suppliers' CSR. The results indicate that supplier dependence has a negative impact on the Chinese supplier's CSR performance. Meanwhile, the negative impact of supplier dependence is mitigated for the supplier's more volatile industrial context, while improving corporate transparency enhances the negative impact of supplier dependence. This study verifies the applicability of RDT for the analysis of CSR in the supply chain in emerging markets such as China. Moreover, the study further extends research on the role of buyer-supplier relationships in CSR in the supply chain by extending the research perspective to the supplier side and adding the external and internal uncertainty of the supplier to the theoretical framework for analysis. We also provide managerial implications for implementing Chinese suppliers' CSR from the buyer's and supplier's perspectives.","[Zhang, Zhe; Hu, Dan; Liang, Liang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, 193 Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhe; Hu, Dan; Liang, Liang] Minist Educ, Key Lab Proc Optimizat & Intelligent Decis Making, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology,"Hu, D (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, 193 Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zhangzhe@mail.hfut.edu.cn; deborah_hu@hfut.edu.cn; lliang@hfut.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71904040, 71971074, 71971072]; Ministry of Education of China [16YJC790029]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71904040, 71971074, 71971072), and Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 16YJC790029).",,76,32,32,15,149,,,,1478-4092,1873-6505,,,,DEC,2021,27,5,,,,,,,100702,10.1016/j.pursup.2021.100702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2021.100702,,NOV 2021,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach A sample of consumers was surveyed in farmers' markets and social network analysis (SNA) was adopted as a methodological approach to reconstruct the links between the worlds of production and consumption and to derive the relative importance attributed to various factors that promote relational structures. Findings The work demonstrates the importance of sustainability - as a productive and behavioural model of firms - for the construction of efficient and durable relationship systems in two farmer markets in Sicily. In particular, four fundamental components emerge in the construction of networks represented by consumer sensitivity to sustainability processes, the individual behavioural model of purchasing and consumption, the expectation of political direction and the level and factors of knowledge of the firm. The clustering elements of the relationships were found to be the territory and local products, the environmentalist attitude and the protection of resources, as well as the adoption of a rational waste disposal policy, the fight against food waste, the encouragement of healthier and more sustainable consumption styles, clear and transparent communication and the activation of sustainable supply chain processes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The factors in each of these classes are analysed in relation to their effect over time, on the basis of 49 SAD programmes reported in the literature. Findings show that the social factors of engagement and empowerment, not often addressed in existing SAD programmes, are of significant influence to effect over time, as are the environmental factors of food safety, and the economic factors of production and capacity development. As such this paper shows that in in addition to the well-acknowledged need for knowledge and skills related to food safety, production and capacity development, SAD programmes also need to address the social factors of engagement and empowerment to enable sustainable change over time for SAD through participation.","[Kusnandar, K.; Brazier, F.

Agricultural impacts are not confined to arid and semi-arid regions, but are increasingly experienced in more temperate and humid regions. A transferable drought management framework is needed to transition from coping to adapting to drought through supporting improved planning and policy decision-making through the supply chain from primary producers to consumers. A combination methodology using a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach, an analysis of weekly agricultural trade publications and semi-structured interviews were used to explore drought impacts and responses, using the 2018 United Kingdom drought as a case study. While most reported responses were on-farm, a diverse range of measures were implemented across institutional scales and through the supply chain, reflecting complex interactions within the food system. However, drought responses were dominated by reactive and crisis-driven actions to cope with, or enhance the recovery from, drought; but which contributed little to increased resilience to future droughts. Our transferable drought management framework shows how improved collaboration and multi-sector engagement across spatial, governance and supply-chain scales to develop human and social capital can enable the transition from coping (short-term and reactive) to adapting (long-term and anticipatory) strategies to increase agricultural resilience to future droughts.","[Holman, I.

The U-Shaped Pattern in China's Agricultural and Food Firms",AGRIBUSINESS,,,,Article; Early Access,,,,,,a U-shaped nonlinear pattern; ESG performance; financial performance; media attention; sustainable development,CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY,"ESG (environmental, social, and governance) practices, an internationally recognized concept of a firm's sustainability, can serve as a bridge to enhance effective communication between firms and various stakeholders. It is also a new tool for measuring firms' value. This study employs a balanced panel data set of 114 publicly traded agricultural and food firms in China from 2016 to 2022. It empirically investigates the relationship between ESG and financial performance based on shareholder primacy theory and stakeholder theory. Employing a two-way fixed effects (FE) model, our findings reveal a U-shaped nonlinear pattern in how ESG impacts financial performance. It differs from previous studies that found predominantly positive relationships: Specifically, the average ESG score for firms is 0.396, the median is 0.390, and the inflection point of the U-shape occurs at 0.53. When firms' ESG investments are less than 0.53, the high initial ESG cost makes it difficult to transform ESG into financial improvement. However, once this threshold is surpassed, good ESG can convey an excellent reputation to the public and increase anti-risk ability-which, in turn, significantly improves firms' financial performance and facilitates long-term development. Also, our study demonstrates that firms' ownership and different positions in the supply chain differentially affect the relationship between ESG and financial performance. This paper also offers insights into promoting the sustainable development of Chinese agri-food firms.","[Zhang, Yanyan; Xiong, Tao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Tao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Hub Informat & Price Predict Operat, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University,"Xiong, T (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Xiong, T (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Hub Informat & Price Predict Operat, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",taoxiong@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72171099]; Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China [22ZD079]; Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education [20JZD015],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72171099), Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Project No. 22&ZD079), and Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education (Project No. 20JZD015).",,44,0,0,22,22,,,,0742-4477,1520-6297,,,,2024 OCT 21,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/agr.21989,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.21989,,OCT 2024,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Existing researches on GTI seldom consider consumer preference and market competition, and there is a lack of comparative research on GTI governance mechanisms among different governments. Therefore, considering consumer green technology preference and market competition, this paper proposes three different government intervention policies, i.e., no intervention (B), intervening firm (F) and intervening consumer (C), and develops a three-layer Stackelberg game model including the government, green and non-green firms and consumers to study the impact of three government interventions on GTI, product pricing and profits. Backward induction is used to solve optimal decisions. Then, to maximize social welfare, the optimal government intervention schemes under different conditions are discussed. Considering the impact of consumer behavior and product competition on GTI, this paper innovatively compares the optimal decision-making of manufacturers and the optimal government intervention scheme selection in different conditions from the perspective of maximizing social welfare. The results show that there is no optimal decision that is immutable. Market share of green products is positively correlated with the production cost adjustment coefficient. The intervention decision, GTI and green product pricing are negatively correlated with the green improvement coefficient and positively correlated with the environmental improvement coefficient. This research can be used to better guide the government how to design and select effective GTI incentive mechanism and guide manufacturers how to make the best response mechanism in the competitive environment.","[Liu, Li; Xu, Jiangtao; Zhang, Zaisheng] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhe] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jiangtao] Hainan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Nanjing Audit University; Hainan University,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China.",sunshineli@tju.edu.cn; wangzhe@nau.edu.cn; jiangtaoxu@tju.edu.cn; zhangzs@tju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72102112, 72072092]; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [2020SJA0342]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [21KJB630010]; Green, Low-carbon and Circular Economy Institute of Yancheng [22405]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Green, Low-carbon and Circular Economy Institute of Yancheng","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers who provided valuable comments and suggestions to significantly improve the quality of the paper.

It is also a right step towards the fuel conservation and environmental concern in disposing used commodities. Economics of logistics and transportation plays a major role in deciding the competitiveness of the product, either new or used, in the market. With the upward trends of fuel and logistics costs, manufacturing industries have little option other than keeping the cost of transportation the lowest. Many organizations now started implementing lesser expensive and proper transport modes to keep the maintenance of supply chain cost to the minimum. Proper handling of returned commodities to recover value without affecting the environment may need appropriate techniques or methodologies. This paper deals with the routing of vehicles with energy conservation as the agenda in the value recovering method named as repair service work. It is done through a big data-based deep learning model, in a multicommodity environment. Here, the transportation of commodities to repair service facilities is given an in-depth focus to reduce the energy use. The minimization of the distance traveled by the truck fleet reduces the energy consumption by the trucks. This article deals with the optimization of emergency logistic with the assistance of deep learning approach, whereas this approach attains 57.19km with 6 optimized routes.

(UN, 2015). We deal with the logistic network, an important component of the Supply Chain, in industries either generating or using hazardous material (HM) in some stage of their productive processes. A major concern when transporting HM or locating hazardous facilities is to minimize risks and hazards to the population and environment. Most studies on this issue only consider one type of HM and fail to differentiate populations with different degrees of vulnerability. This work addresses both the problem of locating hazardous facilities and routing HMs across a large, densely populated urban area, minimizing the associated costs and hazards imposed on the population. Populations, aggregated in centers, were differentiated into vulnerable populations, which are the hardest to evacuate in a short period of time, and non-vulnerable populations. Several types of HMs with different degrees of hazard were considered. We propose a multi-objective programming model with multiple origin-destination (OD) pairs that considers maximizing the minimum weighted distance between hazardous facilities and the exposed vulnerable population, maximizing the minimum weighted distance from HM transportation arcs to the exposed vulnerable population, minimizing the total hazard imposed on the non-vulnerable population, and routing and location costs.

This study examines the causal relationship between climate change and firms' ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance using data from Chinese manufacturing firms listed between 2009 and 2021, while controlling for firm-specific and climate-related factors. The findings reveal that temperature deviation (TD) significantly improves firms' ESG performance, a result that remains robust across various tests. Moreover, TD enhances ESG performance primarily through reputation and costs channels, with stronger effects observed in firms with low reputations compared to high-reputation firms, and in high energy-consuming firms compared to those with low energy consumption. This study offers a novel perspective on how climate change impacts firms at the operational level and provides actionable recommendations for governments to support and promote improved ESG performance.","[Xue, Mengzhe] Zhejiang Tech Inst Econ, Sch Logist & Supply Chain Management, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mengyuan; Zheng, Bowen] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Du, Anna Min] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Scotland",Zhejiang University of Technology; Edinburgh Napier University,"Du, AM (corresponding author), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Business Sch, Edinburgh, Scotland.",mengzhexue@163.com; 211122290021@zjut.edu.cn; a.du@napier.ac.uk; zjutzbw@zjut.edu.cn,,,"Zhejiang Provincial Social Science Foundation of China [21NDJC319YBM, 25NDJC103YB]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Wenzhou [24WSK143YBM]",Zhejiang Provincial Social Science Foundation of China; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Wenzhou,This work was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Social Science Foundation of China (Grant number 21NDJC319YBM; 25NDJC103YB); the Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project of Wenzhou (Grant number 24WSK143YBM).,,62,2,2,28,28,,,,1059-0560,1873-8036,,,,MAR,2025,98,,,,,,,,103863,10.1016/j.iref.2025.103863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2025.103863,,MAR 2025,,"Business, Finance; Economics",,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a major challenge exists: high rates of food waste within supply chains. The problem is often seen as a technological issue-a lack of proper infrastructure and coordination creates inefficiencies. This research takes a different perspective, focusing on social relations within the supply chain. It uses the concept of food waste regimes to understand the underlying structures, relationships, and systems that cause food waste, with a focus on Tanzania's avocado trade. The goals of the research are to: (1) Identify the factors contributing to food waste within Tanzania's avocado supply chains, particularly in the context of export-oriented production; (2) Explore how these factors change as production shifts towards exports; (3) Analyse the fairness (equity) of how waste burdens are distributed among those involved. We adopted a follow the thing approach, combining interviews and observations across both domestic and export avocado supply chains in Tanzania. The research reveals that interactions between various aspects of the supply chain-practices, physical properties of the product (avocado perishability), and established institutions-influence where food waste occurs and who shoulders the burden of that waste. The research exposes how unequal power dynamics between participants lead to some actors bearing a disproportionate amount of the risk and cost of food waste. By taking a social relations approach, this research highlights that tackling food waste and social inequality are intertwined issues. The paper suggests potential areas for future research and intervention to address these interconnected challenges.","[Cromwell, Jonas] Univ Leeds, Sch Food Sci & Nutr, Leeds, England; [Whitfield, Stephen; Quinn, Claire Helen] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, England; [Blake, Megan Kathleen] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Sheffield,"Cromwell, J (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Food Sci & Nutr, Leeds, England.",j.cromwell@leeds.ac.uk,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500215/1]; Economic and Social Research Council; Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, University of Sheffield, UK [101060887]; European Commission's Horizon Europe programme; Horizon Europe - Pillar II [101060887] Funding Source: Horizon Europe - Pillar II","Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, University of Sheffield, UK; European Commission's Horizon Europe programme; Horizon Europe - Pillar II(European Union (EU)Horizon Europe - Pillar II)","The authors would like to acknowledge and thank all the farmers, farmer groups and cooperatives, traders and exporters who spoke with us and shared their experiences.

The theoretical framework based on technology, the organization and the environment (TOE) from a configuration perspective provides a new integrated theoretical perspective for studying the green transformation path of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The research purpose of this article is to use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and necessary condition analysis (NCA) to explore the configuration effects of various antecedents in the TOE theoretical framework of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, technology (green technological innovation, digital transformation)-the organization (redundant resources, supply chain concentration, information transparency)-the environment (environmental governance pressure), to achieve a green transformation. The research findings show that no single factor is a necessary condition for achieving a high level of green transformation. There are six ways to achieve high green transformation levels for manufacturing enterprises, namely, technology-information collaborative green transformation, technology-supply chain collaborative-driven green transformation, digital-organization collaborative-driven green transformation, innovation-organization collaborative-driven green transformation, organization-environment collaborative-driven green transformation, and full-level multifactor collaborative-driven green transformation. The research conclusion will further expand research on the green transformation of enterprises and provide useful and practical references for green transformation paths of enterprises.","[Miao, Zeyan; Zhao, Guohao] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics,"Miao, ZY (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.",201120202002@stu.sxufe.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [23YJC630202]; Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China; [71774105],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China);",The study was approved by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 71774105) and Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of China (grant number: 23YJC630202),,49,14,14,69,189,,,,2045-2322,,,,,NOV 6,2023,13,1,,,,,,,19181,10.1038/s41598-023-46454-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46454-9,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While previous literature has demonstrated the value of informal institutions for filling gaps left by formal institutions, the role of failed informal institutions has received less attention. Our analysis reveals how, in the case of an unprecedented challenge like climate adaptation, relying on informal institutions with less agency can actually erode the strength of existing institutions in a form of negative institutional plasticity. In this case, emerging polycentric governance was unsuccessful, unable to construct clearly demarcated responsibilities due to impedance by the path dependence of the current federalist system. The latter works well for traditional infrastructure investments with a closed pool of stakeholders, but not for ports where multiple scales of embeddedness, both horizontally and vertically, produce a collective action problem with no mechanism for resolution.","[Ng, Adolf K.

As a result, how the government can regulate the uncertified recycler to improve environment and public health during the recycling processes has become a critical issue. To help tackle this issue, we build an evolutionary game model to study the interactions between the government and the uncertified recycler. We conduct stability analysis of each participant and obtain four asymptotically stable states. Furthermore, we conduct numerical simulations for comparative analysis based on the current situation of the Chinese e-waste recycling industry. Our results are as follows. First, there exist multiple asymptotically stable states for the government and the uncertified recycler, namely (no-governance, maintaining status quo), (governance, maintaining status quo), (governance, industrial upgrading), and (no-governance, industrial upgrading). Then, we verify the validity of the evolutionary game model through numerical simulations and find that penalty, supervision cost, additional investment cost, and financial subsidy can significantly influence the behavioral strategy of the government and the uncertified recycler. Finally, we find that the government should adopt the reward-penalty-supervision mechanism to promote the healthy development of the e-waste recycling industry and protect the environment and public health. Specifically, first, the government's subsidy for the uncertified recycler has upper and lower limits. Exceeding the upper limit will result in an excessive financial burden to the government, while falling below the lower limit will hinder the uncertified recycler from technology upgrading. Second, the government should strengthen the supervision of the uncertified recycler and increase the punishment for violations. Third, the government should focus on controlling the supervision cost. Fourth, according to the asymptotically stable state (no-governance, industrial upgrading), the government should prepare to withdraw from the market when the uncertified recycler chooses industrial upgrading.","[Wang, Qixiang; Li, Bangyi] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Kong, Linghui] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Guangzhou 510320, Peoples R China; [Li, Jin] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Key Res Inst, Sch Management & Business, Modern Business Res Ctr, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fan] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Accounting, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Kong, LH (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Guangzhou 510320, Peoples R China.",270409@nau.edu.cn; wangzhe90@nuaa.edu.cn; jinli@mail.zjgsu.edu.cn; 20131818@gdufe.edu.cn; wangfan1031@mail.zjgsu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [18CGL039, 19BGL194]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY20G020006, LY18G020006]; Major Humanities and Social Sciences Research Projects at Zhejiang Universities [2018QN007]; Guangzhou Development District communications Investment Group Co.

Design/methodology/approach The study analysed the impacts of sustainability multiple issues on one-year lagged return on assets, developing a longitudinal analysis focused on best and worst companies' samples for a timeframe of ten years. Notably, we performed OLS regressions on unbalanced panels data collecting overall 1,760 annual observations from 318 companies. Moreover, we examined the moderating effects of slack resources on the relationship between sustainability and the short-term firms' profitability. Findings The results show that the best sustainable companies usually improve future profitability. Conversely, the worst ones should prioritize efforts in specific initiatives (i.e. responsible products, eco-innovation, management and governance commitment to sustainability), which positively affect their profitability and compensate possible short-term financial losses due to CSR strategy execution and sustainable production/supply chain management. Finally, the study found mixed results regarding the moderating effects of slack resources on the scrutinized relationships. Practical implications The paper highlights the key environmental, social and governance aspects to be addressed for consolidating and enhancing the virtuous relationship between non-financial and financial performance, distinguishing between best and worst sustainability performers. Originality/value This study is among the first that decomposed sustainability in multiple micro aspects (i.e. sustainable strategy, products and processes) investigating the effects of each of them on the short-term agri-food firms' profitability.","[Cupertino, Sebastiano; Vitale, Gianluca; Riccaboni, Angelo] Univ Siena, Dept Business & Law, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Cupertino, S (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Business & Law, Siena, Italy.",cupertino@unisi.it; gianluca.vitale@unisi.it; angelo.riccaboni@unisi.it,,,,,,,45,16,16,7,30,,,,0007-070X,1758-4108,,,,SEP 21,2021,123,13,,,,,317,336,,10.1108/BFJ-02-2021-0154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-02-2021-0154,,AUG 2021,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study employs, for the first time, the grounded theory (GT) methodology to investigate how sustainability is perceived and practiced by the entrepreneurs of the Italian poultry supply chain. The results provide insights into how changes toward greater sustainability can be transformed into concrete pathways that function within the organizational design. The outcome could be the reconfiguration of the organizational design, whereby the practice becomes incisive, or its circumvention, whereby the practice is adopted only superficially. The development of a more standardized ESG reporting system, along with incentivization measures and policies supporting small and medium-sized agrifood companies in the adoption of sustainability practices, could contribute to overcoming the detachment between the sustainability perceived and practiced by agrifood companies and to effectively adopting environmental sustainability as a development strategy.","[Toscano, Armando] Pipera Persone Ambienti Profess Network Soc & Env, I-20127 Milan, Italy; [Balzarotti, Melissa; Re, Ilaria] Consorzio Italbiotec, I-20126 Milan, Italy",,"Balzarotti, M (corresponding author), Consorzio Italbiotec, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",melissa.balzarotti@italbiotec.it,,,Cariplo Foundation,Cariplo Foundation(Fondazione Cariplo),"This research is part of the project SMART FEED-Sustainable Model for Agroenergy and Feed production by UrbanWaste Recycling and Treatment, funded by the Cariplo Foundation in the context of the call for the proposal Circular Economy for a sustainable future 2019, grant number 2019-2206.",,91,14,15,7,91,,,,,2071-1050,,,,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,14088,10.3390/su142114088,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114088,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change is converging with socio-economic, demographic and technological changes to create a 'perfect storm' for the region's electricity system. Distribution networks are particularly affected, with these factors contributing to tremendous peak demand growth, about double the rate of growth in average demand in recent years. This paper reviews how Australia's electricity system is adapting to multiple drivers of peak electricity demand. We use socio-technical transitions theory to understand the temporal interconnected social and technical dimensions of adaptation in this setting. Specifically, we present an historical narrative of the emergence of centralisation in Australia and outline the peak demand problem in SEQ and review adaptation options from the international literature. We also analyse the interactions between key social groups and their adaptation responses over the past decade. Our analysis shows that adaptation has become a contested process between supply-chain actors and end-users, each with different economic objectives, adaptation needs and capacities. The resulting adaptation dynamic that is emerging shows worrying signs of maladaptation.

International trade has exacerbated the pressures of China's carbon emissions and water consumption. This work establishes a multi-regional input-output model for time series analysis. It aims to understand how human final demands affect an economy's water consumption and carbon emissions by contrasting the similarity and dissimilarity of China's carbon footprint and water footprint. The results show that >90% of China's carbon and water footprints are embodied in trade, and China was a net exporter of embodied carbon and virtual water from 1990 to 2010. This could mean that China is burdened with more environmental pollution and resource pressures in the global supply and demand chain. We find that China's main net export destination of carbon-water-intensive products are developed areas such as North America and Europe, while China's main net import sources are developing areas such as Africa and Southeast Asia. Heavy industry and transportation contain the most carbon footprint in China, while agriculture, fishery and light industry contain the most water footprint. Also, China's embodied carbon and virtual water in diverse sectors in different years vary from region to region. The similarities and differences between China's carbon and water footprints should be considered when making decisions to better governance of climate change and water crisis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating the literature on digital transformation and MSPs, we delineate firms' MSP efforts along with three dimensions (digital operation efforts, technology sharing efforts, and flat management efforts) and posit that each addresses specific challenges associated with the environmental, social, and governance components of ESG performance. Using a sample of 213 publicly listed Chinese firms, encompassing 1527 firm-year observations, we measure the variation in the three dimensions of MSP efforts through a deep neural network-based latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to analyze their annual reports. We find that digital operation efforts enhance environmental, social, and governance performance; technology sharing efforts primarily improve environmental and social performance; and flat management efforts boost only governance performance. In addition, these effects are more pronounced for large firms than for small firms. Two robustness checks, employing patent applications and granted patents as alternative indicators of firms' MSP efforts, further corroborate these findings. This research augments both the MSP and ESG literature, offering actionable insights for firms, governments, and non-governmental organizations.","[Ma, Yongchao Martin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yongchao Martin; Teng, Ying; Yang, Zhilin; Zheng, Xu (Vivian)] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mkt, Kowloon Tong, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Zhongzhun] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Mkt, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; City University of Hong Kong; Sichuan University,"Teng, Y (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mkt, Kowloon Tong, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",martin@hust.edu.cn; danieldeng@scu.edu.cn; yingteng2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; mkzyang@cityu.edu.hk; xuzheng@cityu.edu.hk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72072065, 71672063, 72072152]; Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR [CityU 11502218]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"Yongchao Martin Ma and Zhongzhun Deng, as co -first authors, contributed equally to this work.

As such, the case raises a number of questions around shifting trade patterns and their implications for sustainability outcomes. I address these questions through four propositions - three mechanisms and one condition - through which South-South trade can expand the opportunities for sustainable development. While the exact nature of sustainable development outcomes will ultimately be decided through domestic political struggles, shifts toward more equal trade can make sustainable production more likely. Overall, the analysis draws attention to nuanced ways in which end markets shape their respective supply chains and how these dynamics impact the potential for actors operating at the bottom of supply chains to shape sustainability outcomes.","[Bloomfield, Michael J.] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Bloomfield, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England.",m.j.bloomfield@bath.ac.uk,,,"John Fell Fund, University of Oxford","John Fell Fund, University of Oxford","I would like to thank the editors of this special issue and the anonymous reviewers for their generous comments throughout the process.

This study explores whether green manufacturing (GM) is expensive and how external institutional environmental pressures influence the cost of GM among industrial enterprises in emerging economies. Through an analysis of 10,380 observations of 1470 listed manufacturing firms in the Chinese share market from 2008 to 2015, this paper finds that GM increases operating cost (OC). In addition, the positive relationship between GM and OC is strengthened with reduced pollution level in the local city. Furthermore, synergistic effects of the local pollution level and the local government's pollution information transparency are found. Firms' OC increases more as firms carry out GM when both the local pollution level and pollution information transparency of local government are high, or when the local pollution level and the local government's pollution information transparency are low.","[Mao, Yunshi; Wang, Jing] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangjingask@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China; Project of Green Industry Chain Evaluation Index System and Green Governance Mechanism [15AZD061],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Project of Green Industry Chain Evaluation Index System and Green Governance Mechanism,"Our gratitude goes to the National Social Science Foundation of China, as this study is supported by the Project of Green Industry Chain Evaluation Index System and Green Governance Mechanism (Project No. 15AZD061).",,59,31,33,3,55,,,,0020-7543,1366-588X,,,,DEC 2,2019,57,23,,,SI,,7235,7247,,10.1080/00207543.2018.1480842,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2018.1480842,,,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While there is no evidence that soy has reduced food security in Brazil, tax redistributions and value-added activities from soy remain limited, particularly in comparison to sugarcane production.

This has led to the promulgation of several sustainable procurement indicators (SPIs) and disclosure indexes (DIs) to guide businesses in meeting 'responsible' or 'ethical' business operations. However, extant SPIs and guidelines have reliability challenges due to in-consistencies and varying focuses as most DIs are skewed towards non-discriminatory practices and equity in wealth and income distribution. This study proposes a methodological framework and uses 33 indicators of globally accepted ethical norms and standards for business conduct to develop an index for disclosure of sustainable procurement practices. Based on the proposed framework, we conducted a proof-of-concept study using a sample of 60 companies in four industries listed in the Australian Securities Exchange. The findings reveal significant variations in disclosure, with less than 20% of the investigated companies reporting 80% or more of the 33 indicators that constitute the disclosure index. It is observed that companies tend to disclose more in the governance and the environmental dimensions, but less in the economic and the social domains. These results indicate that the disclosure index developed using the proposed framework can be a useful tool for assessing transparency in reporting sustainable procurement practices and can help improve sustainability performance across the supply chain. The index thus provides stakeholders and the public with a lens to examine and monitor a company's sustainable sourcing practices.","[Lau, Kwok Hung; Yadlapalli, Aswini; Abdulrahman, Muhammad Dan-Asabe; Chhetri, Prem; Thai, Vinh] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Melbourne, Australia; [Lau, Kwok Hung] Level 8,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lau, KH (corresponding author), Level 8,445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",charles.lau@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,68,3,3,2,11,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,SEP 25,2023,420,,,,,,,,138357,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138357,,AUG 2023,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed tool is based on an incremental perspective, according to two main dimensions: mutual trust among partners and the extent of the cooperation. Design/methodology/approach - This study used a synthesising approach to gauge potential contributions previously spread across different streams of research and disciplines that are now integrated into the framework. We conduct a deep literature review to characterise the horizontal collaboration phenomenon along two levels of analysis. In doing so, we examined relevant literature in the field of horizontal cooperation in logistics to critically appraise aims of, impediments to and existing models for horizontal collaboration. Additionally, we reviewed seminal literature of four organisational theories to assess their potential to contribute to the theoretical foundations of the growing topic of horizontal collaboration. Transaction Cost Economics, Social Exchange, Resource Dependence and Social Dilemma represent the theoretical foundations to cast light to how to design and implement inter-organisational horizontal initiatives. Findings - The proposed tool organises horizontal collaborations within three steps for each of the two levels of classification: trust and extent of the cooperation. The organisational theories reviewed play different roles to help in different stages of the horizontal collaboration. Additionally, for each combination of trust/extent of the cooperation coherent pairs of aims of the collaboration and assets that are to be shared are defined. Research limitations/implications - The article represents the first attempt to analyse horizontal collaboration from within the discipline itself and from the wider field of SCM through other well-established theoretical lenses. The proposed tool has shed some light into the black box of (un) successful horizontal collaboration, but it is theory based - which represents its main limitations - thus, requiring further testing of the research streams suggested in the paper. Practical implications - The article not only gives insights into theoretical challenges of horizontal collaborations that needs further investigation but is also useful to companies involved in horizontal collaborations by helping define coherent assets that are to be shared to achieve specific goals. In its more theoretical underpinning, the framework can also inspire the partnership philosophy and help sketch a collaborative evolutionary path. Originality/value - The lack of a theoretically robust landmark that could help understand, design and implement horizontal collaborations has been defined as a major theoretical and practical shortcoming. The article represents the first contribution aimed at filling that gap.","[Pomponi, Francesco] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Fratocchi, Luciano] Univ Aquila, Dept Ind & Informat Engn & Econ, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Tafuri, Silvia Rossi] Cranfield Sch Management, Supply Chain Res Ctr, Cranfield, Beds, England",University of Brighton; University of L'Aquila; Cranfield University,"Pomponi, F (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",f.pomponi@brighton.ac.uk,,,,,,,112,106,117,9,135,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,,2015,20,1,,,,,83,97,,10.1108/SCM-02-2014-0078,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-02-2014-0078,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have in depth analysed 671 publications from 1990 to mid-2023, employing Leximancer and VOSviewer tools. Our analysis uncovered key themes, including buildings, waste management, value chains, and sustainable development, linking the circular cities concept and circular economy framework. Emerging research trends, such as urban metabolism, urban mining, governance models, the built environment, sustainability benchmarks, and value chain management, signify deliberate shifts towards higher circular development and implementation. These trajectories harmonise with overarching sustainable development goals. Contemporary research emphasises urban mining, circular indicators, adaptive resource reuse, and urban structure regeneration. This focus facilitates transitioning from linear models to heightened circularity within urban contexts. Research inclination is shifting from traditional economic and environmental concerns towards holistic urban configurations that prioritise social integration, communal well-being, and the dynamics of the social economy. Through this analytical expedition, we offer novel insights that enhance our understanding of the intricate symbiosis between circular cities and the circular economy.

The first, efficiency-substitution agriculture, aims to improve input use efficiency and to minimise environmental impacts of modern farming systems. It is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second, biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming, socialecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation, identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing multi-actor and multidomain approaches based on a combination of scientific and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative systems designed by stakeholders.","[Duru, Michel; Therond, Olivier; Fares, M'hand] INRA, UMR 1248 AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Duru, Michel; Therond, Olivier; Fares, M'hand] Univ Toulouse, INPT, UMR 1248 AGIR, F-31029 Toulouse, France",INRAE; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse,"Duru, M (corresponding author), INRA, UMR 1248 AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",michel.duru@toulouse.inra.fr; Olivier.Therond@toulouse.inra.fr,,,"French Agency for Research; French National Research Agency; RTRA Sciences and Technologies for Aviation and Space; seventh European framework programme (Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology)","French Agency for Research(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); RTRA Sciences and Technologies for Aviation and Space; seventh European framework programme (Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology)(European Union (EU))","This paper has benefited from discussions in several projects: O2LA (Locally Adapted Organisms and Organisations) funded by the French Agency for Research, MICMAC Design (Modelling for Integrated Crop Management, Assessment and Cropping system design) funded by the French National Research Agency, MAELIA (Multi-agent for Environmental Norms impact Assessment) funded by the RTRA Sciences and Technologies for Aviation and Space, Cantogether (Crops and ANimals TOGETHER) funded by the seventh European framework programme (Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology) and Tata-Box (Territorial Agroecological Transition in Action: a tool-Box for designing and implementing a transition to a territorial agroecological system in agriculture) funded by the French National Research Agency.",,146,436,466,24,373,,,,1774-0746,1773-0155,,,,OCT,2015,35,4,,,,,1237,1257,,10.1007/s13593-015-0318-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0318-x,,,,Agronomy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A case study of municipal and fishery policy integration,CLIMATE POLICY,,,,Article,,,,,,Canada; climate policy integration; coastal fisheries; municipal adaptation planning,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; NORTHERN GULF COD; SUPPLY CHAINS; GOVERNANCE,"Place-based adaptation planning is an approach to address cross-sectoral and multi-level governance concerns as well as to build local adaptive capacity in vulnerable resource-dependent communities facing the adverse impacts of climate change. In contrast, sector-based adaptation planning focuses on addressing climate change impacts on individual economic sectors (e.g. fisheries or forestry) or sub-sectors (such as lobsters or timber). Yet, linking sectoral approaches with local adaptation policies is challenging. More effort is needed to identify opportunities for complementary adaptation strategies and policy integration to foster multiple benefits. In this article, we use a case study of fishery sector resources and municipal adaptation planning in Nova Scotia to demonstrate how meaningful entry points could catalyse policy integration and lead to co-benefits across multiple levels and stakeholder groups. Drawing on a fisheries systems and fish chain framework, we identify and assess several entry points for policy integration across sector-and place-based adaptation domains within coastal habitats, as well as harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors. The analysis highlights the multiple benefits of integrating local municipal adaptation plans with multi-scale resource sectors especially towards monitoring ecosystem changes, protecting essential infrastructure, and securing local livelihoods. POLICY RELEVANCE Climate change is having a growing impact on coastal communities around the world, with consequences for sea-level rise, critical habitats, essential infrastructure, and multiple economic sectors and industries. This Canadian case study demonstrates how municipal adaptation initiatives can be complementary to sector-based adaptation at both local and regional levels through various entry points across commodity production chains. Policy integration across place-based and sector-based adaptation processes should lead to multiple benefits such as conserving marine biodiversity, protecting essential infrastructure, and securing livelihoods. Our analysis, which focuses specifically on the fishery sector and coastal communities, shows that these co-benefits may arise particularly in such coastal-marine systems and provide policy lessons to terrestrial systems and other sectors.","[Khan, Ahmed; Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Business, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Khan, Ahmed; Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Armitage, Derek] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Environm Change & Governance Grp, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada; Saint Marys University - Canada; University of Waterloo,"Khan, A (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Sch Business, Halifax, NS, Canada.;Khan, A (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Halifax, NS, Canada.",ahmed.khan@smu.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC]; International Development Research Centre of Canada; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council; SSHRC, through the Community Conservation Research Network; SSHRC","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC](CGIARSocial Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); International Development Research Centre of Canada(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); SSHRC, through the Community Conservation Research Network(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); SSHRC(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","This research stems from the Governance Working Group of the Partnership for Canada-Caribbean Community Climate Change Adaptation project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC] and the International Development Research Centre of Canada.

The shift from fossil fuel -centric to material -centric equipment has also shifted the consideration and management of environmental and societal impacts across the technology life cycle. Societal desire to reduce raw material needs, mitigate supply chain social and governance challenges, and take advantage of the reuse and recycling capabilities of materials has enhanced interest in regenerative economic models, called circular economies (CEs). A recent critical review documented that solar PV is on a path towards increased circularity, but the need remains to expand activities beyond recycling to a broader set of environmental and policy activities to fully realize the benefits [1,2]. Thus, the goal of this research roadmap is to facilitate and accelerate the transition to a solar PV CE by 1) highlighting current opportunities for PV value chain stakeholders to adopt circular strategies and 2) assessing research and development (R &D) needs that can be addressed in the short term to advance a CE for the solar industry.","[Shaw, Stephanie L.; Rencheck, Mitchell L.; Siegfried, Gabriella A.; Libby, Cara] Elect Power Res Inst, 3420 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),"Shaw, SL (corresponding author), Elect Power Res Inst, 3420 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",sshaw@epri.com,,,,,,,141,3,3,9,19,,,,0038-092X,1471-1257,,,,JUL 1,2024,276,,,,,,,,112580,10.1016/j.solener.2024.112580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2024.112580,,JUN 2024,,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is of significant importance for emerging market firms aiming to expand their presence in international markets, as they are compelled to bolster their environmental and social sustainability capacity to enhance their export intensity. This study delves into the relationship between corporate sustainability and export intensity through a longitudinal examination of 141 firms listed on Borsa Istanbul from 2014 to 2021. The results suggest that corporate sustainability positively influences export intensity, and this influence is further positively moderated by research and development (R&D) intensity. Additionally, post hoc analysis employing supplementary data pertaining to the environmental, social, and governance dimensions of corporate sustainability reveals that environmental performance plays a positive role in shaping export intensity, with R&D intensity positively moderating this relationship. In summary, the findings underscore that exporting firms that effectively integrate impactful R&D intensity into their international business operations are likely to harness their sustainability strategies, particularly those related to the natural environment, to achieve higher export intensity.","[Aksoy, Mine; Canci, Metin; Hizarci, Atike Elanur] Yalova Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Yalova, Turkiye; [Yilmaz, Mustafa K.; Tatoglu, Ekrem] Ibn Haldun Univ, Sch Business, Basaksehir, Turkiye; [Golgeci, Ismail] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Golgeci, Ismail] Univ Vaasa, InnoLab, Vaasa, Finland; [Tatoglu, Ekrem] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Business Adm, Mubarak Al Abdullah, Kuwait",Yalova University; Ibn Haldun University; Aarhus University; University of Vaasa,"Golgeci, I (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark.;Golgeci, I (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, InnoLab, Vaasa, Finland.",maksoy@yalova.edu.tr; mustafa.yilmaz@ihu.edu.tr; i.golgeci@btech.au.dk; tatoglu.e@gust.edu.kw; metin.canci@yalova.edu.tr; atike.hizarci@yalova.edu.tr,,,,,,,116,1,1,19,48,,,,1069-031X,1547-7215,,,,DEC,2024,32,4,,,,,38,57,,10.1177/1069031X231214233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1069031X231214233,,JAN 2024,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We argue that there is a potential tension between input and output legitimacy in MSIs. Input legitimacy requires facilitating representation from a wide range of organizations with heterogeneous interests. This work, however, faces collective action problems that could lead to limited ambitions, lowering output legitimacy. We find that, under the right conditions a relatively small group of motivated actors, who we call institutional stewards, may be willing to undertake the cost and labor of building and maintaining the MSI. This can help reconcile the tension between input and output legitimacy in a formal sense, though it also results in inequalities in power. We test this claim using a case study of organizations' activities in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We find that a small group of founding members-and other members of long tenure-account for a disproportionate level of activity in the organization.","[Kruuse, Mikkel; Tangbaek, Kasper Reming; Jespersen, Kristjan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Gallemore, Caleb] Lafayette Coll, Int Affairs Program, Easton, PA 18042 USA",Copenhagen Business School; Lafayette College,"Kruuse, M (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mk.msc@cbs.dk; kasper_tangbaek@hotmail.com; kj.msc@cbs.dk; gallemoc@lafayette.edu,,,,,,,119,6,6,1,7,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6621,10.3390/su11236621,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236621,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To overcome these issues, companies need to adopt digital technologies, reshape consumer demand, and implement flexible work arrangements, with a focus on sustainability. This transition bolstered attention on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. In this study, we introduce new metrics to evaluate ESG performance in the logistics sector. To resolve inconsistencies in existing approaches, we propose the Standardised Unitless Rating (SUR) methodology, which combines satisfaction scores and criterion relevance. We employed the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (IT2FAHP) to calculate the relative weights of ESG criteria. The results show that newly established companies with innovative technology have performed better than traditional companies. This proposed method has been validated by comparing it with existing methods. Additionally, we observed the importance of relative weight as compared to criteria with equal weight. The findings suggest that incorporating process metrics could help companies enhance their ESG performance.","[Juvvala, Rambabu; Sangle, Shirish; Tiwari, Manoj Kumar] Indian Inst Management, Mumbai, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Mumbai,"Juvvala, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management, Mumbai, India.",Jrbabu777@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,2,2,31,41,,,,0020-7543,1366-588X,,,,FEB 16,2025,63,4,,,,,1256,1274,,10.1080/00207543.2024.2373417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2373417,,JUL 2024,,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",,Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Urban agglomeration has complex trade linkages internally and externally. Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) is the largest urban agglomeration in northern China and suffers from severe air pollution problems. Despite the importance of BC mitigation and the study area of JJJ, there is a lack of studies exploring the embodied BC emission transfers hidden behind trade within and across the JJJ urban agglomeration at the city scale, given the importance of interregional collaboration among cities for air pollution control. This paper applied the multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis and structure path analysis (SPA) to investigate the impact of trade on the BC emissions in JJJ and identify the critical sectors and supply chains, using the latest available China's city-level MRIO table. The results show that the embodied BC emission intensity in JJJ is 143.17 g/10(4) yuan, which exceeds the national average (121.89 g/10(4) yuan). The Construction sector contributes 27.93 % of the total embodied BC emissions in JJJ. The cities of Handan, Tangshan, and Hengshui are the largest providers of emission-intensive products (3.51, 2.83, and 2.05 Gg, respectively) while Beijing is the largest receiver (5.78 Gg). From a supply chain perspective, Coal and Metal Mining are the main upstream industries, accounting for a considerable proportion of the BC emissions supply chain. To enhance the interregional collaborative governance of BC pollution control in JJJ, horizontal governance mechanisms, decentralized and polycentric urban planning, industrial clustering and technology upgrading, and effective policies for specific regions and industrial sectors are suggested.","[Guo, Shan; Zhao, Qingyun; Zhang, Xiuzhi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [He, Ping] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yang] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands",Renmin University of China; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Groningen,"Guo, S; Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",shan.guo@connect.polyu.hk; zhaoqingyun986@ruc.edu.cn; ping2021.he@connect.polyu.hk; wang.y@rug.nl; zhangxiuzhi@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72004225]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [24YJAZH036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [23XNQT01],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72004225) , the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China (No. 24YJAZH036) , and the Funda-mental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (No. 23XNQT01) .",,72,1,1,35,35,,,,0195-9255,1873-6432,,,,JAN,2025,110,,,,,,,,107678,10.1016/j.eiar.2024.107678,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2024.107678,,SEP 2024,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lack of access to efficacious medicines in LMICs further exacerbates this inequity. Addressing inequitable access to medicines and assuring their sustainable use is critical to the well-being of these populations. Whilst inadequate access to medicines in LMICs has drawn much attention, less is known about the sustainable use of available medicines, particularly to ensure their efficacy and mitigate harm to the population and the environment. Uganda has adopted various measures to ensure sustainable medicines use, including a national medicines policy, essential medicines list, medicines regulation framework and promotion of domestic medicines production. Despite progress, challenges remain to achieving sustainable medicines use in the country, including fragmented access, inappropriate use, poor quality and inappropriate disposal. There is a need to consolidate the globally embraced One Health approach (fostering collaboration between human, animal and environmental health sectors) to addressing these challenges as espoused in the country's One Health strategic plan. Medicines supply chain management in public sector health facilities needs to be strengthened to minimize inventory shortages (stock-outs). A strategy for universal health insurance can minimize economic barriers to medicines access. Enhanced professional and medicines regulation in the private health market needs to be implemented. There are opportunities to build further capacity in Uganda, particularly infrastructure for regulation of its healthcare systems, policy and governance, workforce capacity building, and population action and engagement.","[Kamba, Pakoyo F.; Nambatya, Winnie; Aguma, Herbert B.; Rajab, Kalidi] Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm, POB 7072, Kampala, Uganda; [Charani, Esmita] Imperial Coll London, NIHR Hlth Protect Res Unit, Healthcare Associated Infect & Antimicrobial Resi, Hammersmith Campus, London W12 0NN, England; [Charani, Esmita] Univ Cape Town, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & HIV Med, Cape Town, South Africa",Makerere University; Imperial College London; University of Cape Town,"Kamba, PF (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm, POB 7072, Kampala, Uganda.",kambaf2000@yahoo.com,,,Economic and Social Research Council Council (ESRC); National Institute for Health Research; Government of the Republic of Uganda through Makerere University Research and Innovations Fund; UK Department of Health; Public Health England [HPRU2012-10047]; UK Department of Health and Social Care through the Fleming Fund Country Grant II for Uganda under the Infectious Diseases Institute; Public Health England; Department of Health; Economic and Social Research Council; Makerere University; ESRC [ES/P008313/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Government of the Republic of Uganda through Makerere University Research and Innovations Fund; UK Department of Health(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Public Health England; UK Department of Health and Social Care through the Fleming Fund Country Grant II for Uganda under the Infectious Diseases Institute; Public Health England; Department of Health; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Makerere University; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council Council (ESRC) and the National Institute for Health Research; Government of the Republic of Uganda through Makerere University Research and Innovations Fund; UK Department of Health in partnership with Public Health England, Grant/Award Number: HPRU2012-10047; UK Department of Health and Social Care through the Fleming Fund Country Grant II for Uganda under the Infectious Diseases Institute; Public Health England; Department of Health; National Institute for Health Research; Economic and Social Research Council; Makerere University",,63,2,2,1,12,,,,0306-5251,1365-2125,,,,SEP,2022,88,9,,,,,3936,3942,,10.1111/bcp.15324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcp.15324,,APR 2022,,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The theory explains why investors appear willing to pay a premium for responsible assets. According to recent reports, however, Covid-19, supply chain uncertainties, and the recent surge in inflation have led to a resurgence of investment in what could be considered non-responsible assets. Investor sentiment thus appears to have changed. Our research question in this paper is whether market uncertainty acts as a contingency variable of warm-glow preferences, such that in times of crisis, investors lose the taste for responsible assets, in favor of the preservation of their consumption and wealth. Exploring a global sample of 882 financial sector firms over two decades, we use panel regressions to link both operating and stock performance to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. We break down our sample into periods of low and high uncertainty. Our results indicate that uncertainty may moderate investors' warm-glow preferences, as hypothesized. Thus, our study adds uncertainty as an important contextual contingency to discussions on socially responsible investing: investors may be willing to do good in good times only.","[Dreyer, Johannes K.; Sund, Kristian J.; Tatomir, Mirel] Roskilde Univ, Dept Social Sci & Business, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Tatomir, Mirel] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Coll SDC, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tatomir, Mirel] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Niels Jensens Vej 2,Bldg 1190, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Roskilde University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Dreyer, JK (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Social Sci & Business, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",jodreyer@ruc.dk,,,Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research,Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research.

Globally, conflicts over renewables industry between the developed and emerging economies have affected the provision of green goods-thus slowing the overall welfare of global environmental governance. This article argues that the above phenomenon is a new form of green dilemma which arises from the long-lasting issue of balancing environmental protection and economic gains. It further tracks the historical evolutionary change of green dilemma, from version 1.0 to 2.0 to the current avatar of Green Dilemma 3.0. By developing the Green Dilemma Framework, the article aims to uncover the logic underlying the industrial policies and trade conflicts between the developed and emerging economies in their energy transitions. Utilizing the US vs China and US vs India conflicts in the solar PV industries as the two group of cases, the key feature of Green Dilemma 3.0 is illustrated as the conflict over status and control of the global division of labor in the new energy industry. This article offers a novel perspective on global inequality by deconstructing the unequal global production system that can act to restrict the optimization of energy use and production in tackling climate change and thus successively hindering global environmental governance in its realization of optimal results. Underneath global climate change governance, there is an un-equal global production network and political system, and both these follow a core, semi-periphery, and pe-riphery distribution of power structure. We argue that the inequality of global production system suppresses the effects of subsidy competition and erodes the economic foundation of global climate governance.","[Xu, Qinyi; Dhaundiyal, Shruti] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Xu, Qinyi] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge, England; [Guan, Chuanjing] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Polit Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of International Business & Economics,"Guan, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Polit Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qx224@cam.ac.uk; sd646@cam.ac.uk; gcjing@uibe.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [19QD19],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE,"The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Haoyang Zhang from Harvard University, and all the reviewers for their insightful comments and guidance.

Although it is well established that agriculture is a dominant driver of deforestation, rates and mechanisms remain disputed and often lack a clear evidence base. We synthesize the best available pantropical evidence to provide clarity on how agriculture drives deforestation. Although most (90 to 99%) deforestation across the tropics 2011 to 2015 was driven by agriculture, only 45 to 65% of deforested land became productive agriculture within a few years. Therefore, ending deforestation likely requires combining measures to create deforestation-free supply chains with landscape governance interventions.

Different stakeholders ranging from shippers and carriers to government and non-government associations have expressed worries and expectations about responsible consumption and production in shipping industry. This paper aims to advance the knowledge by exploring the adoption and performance value of responsible shipping practices. Using the concept analysis approach, we first construct a two-folder conceptual framework with strategic folder and practical folder considering the dual-role of shipping industry in servicing trade activities of the global economy. Accordingly, we carry out a two-way interpretation of responsible shipping in economic, environmental, social performance dimensions as well as supporting measures in resources and technological aspects at the strategic folder, and five processes (design, operations, management, governance, finance) at the practical folder. To examine the adoption and performance value of responsible shipping, we develop propositions concerning its implementation elements as well as the favorable conditions for adoption and the performance value. The framework provides insights to guide managers in shipping industry to design, plan, and implement responsible practices to meet the escalating public expectations for shipping operations in servicing international trade and global supply chain activities.","[Xue, Yuemei; Lai, Kee-Hung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, PolyU Business Sch, Shipping Res Ctr, Hung Hom,Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Lai, KH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, PolyU Business Sch, Shipping Res Ctr, Hung Hom,Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",mike.lai@polyu.edu.hk,,,Hong Kong Polytechnic University [P0036667]; General Research Fund of Hong Kong Research Grant Council [15502422],Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); General Research Fund of Hong Kong Research Grant Council,This work was partially supported by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (P0036667) and the General Research Fund of Hong Kong Research Grant Council (15502422).,,80,18,19,6,21,,,,0967-070X,1879-310X,,,,JAN,2023,130,,,,,,89,99,,10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.11.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.11.007,,NOV 2022,,Economics; Transportation,,Business & Economics; Transportation,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The List of Priority Municipalities (LPM) launched in 2008 became a central tenet of these efforts. It requires local agents in listed municipalities to individually and collectively reduce deforestation and implement a comprehensive farm-geocoding registry across the municipality. We combine region-wide spatial-temporal land-cover analysis and census data with in-depth fieldwork to examine the LPM policy at regional and municipal levels, discussing the policy's limitations in inducing effective responses across diverse municipalities. At the regional level, our study presents a new historical-geographic categorization and map of 530 Amazonian municipalities. We propose four regional clusters of municipalities according to patterns of deforestation, agricultural activities, demographic and agrarian structures, emancipation history, and socioenvironmental protection. We draw on this analysis to contextualize the trajectories of the 62 listed municipalities within the region's moving deforestation frontier and discuss why many of the achievements observed locally have not been replicated regionally. At the municipal level, we investigate four case studies in-depth to unveil the factors underlying the LPM policy mixed outcomes. We discuss how local agents' responses to the LPM policy are context-specific, reflecting their perception of trade-offs between the economic impacts of sanctions, incentives to collaborate, and potential benefits arising from environmental compliance. We detail and discuss how dynamic macro-political and institutional settings altering law enforcement mechanisms and market incentives interact with subnational environmental governance, either facilitating or inhibiting individual and collective actions locally. Finally, we discuss the role of inter-institutional collaboration and coordination among command-and-control policies, market-oriented initiatives, and incentives for local collective actions in triggering incentives for land-use and governance innovations against deforestation, both locally and regionally.

This paper assesses whether these assumptions hold through the analysis of how the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label for capture fisheries has managed supply, demand and civic concerns in the market for sustainability certifications. The MSC has created and now dominates the market for sustainable fish, but success has been accompanied by serious challenges. The MSC has so far failed to convincingly show that its certification system has positive environmental impacts, and it has marginalized Southern fisheries, especially in low-income countries. As an institutional solution to the global fishery crisis, the MSC seems to be better tuned to the creation of a market for sustainable fish rather than sustainable fisheries.","[Ponte, Stefano] Danish Inst Int Studies, DK-1401 Copenhagen C, Denmark; [Ponte, Stefano] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies; Copenhagen Business School,"Ponte, S (corresponding author), Danish Inst Int Studies, Strandgade 56, DK-1401 Copenhagen C, Denmark.",spo@diis.dk,,,,,,,53,169,186,1,105,,,,1471-0358,1471-0366,,,,APR-JUL,2012,12,2-3,,,SI,,300,315,,10.1111/j.1471-0366.2011.00345.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2011.00345.x,,,,Development Studies; Economics,,Development Studies; Business & Economics,,,Green Submitted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this vein, our study examines the role of board diversity in green growth, renewable energy, social inclusion, and natural capital protection. A green growth index was created using indicators endorsed by the Global Green Growth Organization to accomplish the research objectives. For the 2012-2023, a panel of 451 US non-financial firms was selected from the S&P1500 index. The proposed hypotheses were tested using a fixed effect and quantile-based GMM. The MMQR findings suggest a potential non-linear relationship between diversity in the top management team and green growth. Moreover, a diverse workforce can also encourage environmentally friendly practices. Furthermore, renewable energy has been found to benefit from US board diversity. However, a diverse boardroom can harm social inclusion in the US. In addition, workforce diversity stimulates renewable energy use and social inclusion and protects US natural capital. The impact of board diversity on green growth, renewable energy use (SDG7), and natural capital protection can be amplified by enhancing the diversity of independent directors, gender diversity, and professionals from different backgrounds. Diversity in the workforce and boardrooms is imperative to renewable energy, social inclusion and the protection of natural capital.

Positive electrode (cathode) materials within such batteries are rich in critical metals-particularly lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The large-scale mining of such metals, to meet increasing battery demands, poses concerns surrounding material exhaustion in addition to further environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. In particular, unethical mining practices and political instability within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the world's largest cobalt producer) have prompted research into cobalt-low and cobalt-free alternatives. This review aims to provide a holistic view of lithium-ion cathode development and inform advancements by highlighting the interdependencies across mining, material development, and end-of-life management. While material sustainability is reported through supply and demand projections, the potential socioenvironmental impacts of lithium-ion battery technology represent a hugely underresearched area among the aforementioned themes. Notably, the lack of attention paid toward future implications of increased nickel use across material management and development disciplines is also discussed.","[Murdock, Beth E.; Toghill, Kathryn E.; Tapia-Ruiz, Nuria] Univ Lancaster, Dept Chem, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England; [Murdock, Beth E.] Univ Lancaster, Inst Mat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England; [Tapia-Ruiz, Nuria] Faraday Inst, Quad 1 Harwell Sci & Innovat Campus, Didcot OX11 0RA, Oxon, England",Lancaster University; Lancaster University,"Tapia-Ruiz, N (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Chem, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England.",n.tapiaruiz@lancaster.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures [DS-2017-036]; Faraday Institution [FIRG017]; ISCF [EP/S003053/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures(Leverhulme Trust); Faraday Institution(The Faraday Institution); ISCF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),K.E.T. and N.T.-R. gratefully acknowledge the support of the Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures (grant number DS-2017-036) for the provision of a PhD studentship to B.E.M.

Through a case study of a disputed pulp mill in Chile, the study challenges that assumption by examining what the media representation reveals in terms of how legitimacy is constructed in the public sphere. The study asks how were the demands of marginalised stakeholders presented and contested in media texts over time and how this representation contributed to the legitimation process of the mill in the public sphere. Through a decolonial analysis of the newspaper texts, the study finds that the media representations preconditioned how legitimacy was constructed through deliberation, producing an absence of those who did not support the project. Not only does this type of exclusion affect the stakeholder willingness to participate but the legitimacy of the governance schemes itself is at risk when stakeholders chose to defend their demands in its exteriority. The study concludes that to overcome the challenge of exclusion in the public discourses, the focus of public participation need to change from an abstract rational argument driven debate toward an engaged dialogue on subsistence and co-existence in a world where all living beings are interconnected and valid contributors to the debate.

Focusing on lithium in South America, this article examines whether these initiatives address the main sustainability challenges posed by the mining industry and identifies their limitations. We analyze three initiatives relevant for that region: the European Batteries Regulation, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, and the Recommendations for Responsible Lithium Mining by German automotive stakeholders. Sustainability challenges were identified and prioritized through a Delphi survey involving 141 participants. Our findings indicate that while most environmental and social sustainability issues are addressed by these initiatives, economic concerns, particularly those related to development, are often overlooked. The initiatives vary in their comprehensiveness, with IRMA being the most thorough. The study reveals that the approaches and procedures of these initiatives mainly reflect the priorities of lithium-demanding regions and adopt a corporate- centered due diligence approach, limiting their effectiveness in addressing some of the prioritized challenges. Finally, the study emphasizes the need for capability-development mechanisms to enhance the ability of lithium- rich countries to meet higher sustainability standards.","[Obaya, Martin] Natl Sci & Technol Res Council Argentina, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Obaya, Martin] Natl Univ San Martin, Econ & Business Sch, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Murguia, Diego I.] Univ Buenos Aires, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Murguia, Diego I.] Univ Buenos Aires, Interdisciplinary Inst Polit Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Sanchez-Lopez, Daniela] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Cambridge, England",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; University of Cambridge,"Obaya, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Martin, Torre Desarrollo Acad 3-12,25 Mayo & Francia, RA-1650 Buenos Aires, Argentina.",mobaya@unsam.edu.ar,,,Swiss Network for International Studies [C21055],Swiss Network for International Studies,"The work was supported by the Swiss Network for International Studies, under the agreement N degrees C21055.",,78,4,4,12,16,,,,2214-790X,2214-7918,,,,SEP,2024,19,,,,,,,,101509,10.1016/j.exis.2024.101509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2024.101509,,AUG 2024,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This raises the important question of which digitisation factors most significantly impact environmental sustainability performance, as well as the mediating factor of sustainability innovation balance (the ability of a firm to balance the exploration of new innovations with the exploitation of existing innovations). A comprehensive survey instrument was developed and refined through expert feedback and a pilot study, leading to data collection from 374 professionals in the Freight and Logistics industry in Saudi Arabia, all of whom held senior positions in areas such as business development, IT, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) departments. This data was then analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results of this analysis showed that the key factors impacting sustainability performance were digital competence, strategy alignment, digital adaptability, innovation exploitation and innovation exploration. These findings contribute to the current literature by expanding our understanding of the real-world drivers of sustainability performance. In practical terms, the study will help managers improve sustainability performance by enhancing resource efficiency, streamlining, and supply chain management, as well as improving employee engagement and training, fostering a culture of sustainability within the organisation.","[Mutambik, Ibrahim] King Saud Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Informat Sci, POB 11451, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Mutambik, I (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Informat Sci, POB 11451, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",imutambik@ksu.edu.sa,,,"King Saud University [RSP2024R233]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","King Saud University(King Saud University); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This research was funded by the Researchers Supporting Project (RSP2024R233), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,127,4,4,24,53,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAY,2024,16,10,,,,,,,4310,10.3390/su16104310,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16104310,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because international responsibility is assigned to territorial emissions, countries at either end of the global supply chain effectively evade environmental responsibility by shifting fossil fuel combustion to manufacturing countries. In so doing, they lessen the political challenges of reducing domestic emissions. Although exporters of carbon-intensive goods are reluctant to disadvantage local producers, importers can craft policies that both reduce territorial emissions and create local jobs. Ironically, fossil fuel exporters can emerge as leaders in reducing their own territorial emissions, a finding illustrated by case studies of British Columbia and Norway. The conclusion argues that shifting responsibility for carbon emissions to the point of either final consumption or fossil fuel extraction could facilitate an international climate agreement.","[Harrison, Kathryn] Univ British Columbia, Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Harrison, Kathryn] Canadian Oil Sands, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Harrison, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada via the Sustainable Prosperity Research Network,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada via the Sustainable Prosperity Research Network(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada via the Sustainable Prosperity Research Network, superb research assistance from Stefan Pauer, and insightful feedback from Endre Tvinnereim, Brent Sutton, and the journal's anonymous reviewers.",,49,22,28,0,31,,,,1526-3800,1536-0091,,,,AUG,2015,15,3,,,,,27,48,,10.1162/GLEP_a_00310,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/GLEP_a_00310,,,,Environmental Studies; International Relations; Political Science,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations; Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results reveal that the regulatory factors and organizational factors, especially the political pressure of local governments and the administrative ranking of enterprise leader, are the critical factors to green mining construction in China, and the social factors are relatively insignificant. It can be concluded that the green mining construction is still politically driven campaign-based governance. Thus, it need priority stipulate the respective benefits and responsibilities, and then run the punitive and incentive policies such as environmental taxes, subsidies, and rewards.

The driving forces are often related not only to climate change and other environmental hazards but also to socioeconomic and political factors. In Africa, food security has also assumed a strong urban dimension, raising new issues of physical and financial access to food. However, beyond the conjunctural rhetoric around unregulated food policies, social unrest, socio-economic difficulties, and environmental stresses, an emphasis should be put on socio-cultural aspects of food security. This would be possible through an analysis of connectivities between various stages and actors, i.e., food exchange practices between various socio-ecological spaces, and governance coordination in food security strategies. Based on a study on cassava shortage in Cote d'Ivoire in 2015-2016, this paper explores socio-cultural factors associated with food shortage in urban settings. Findings from a qualitative research approach comprising key-informant interviews and focus group discussion with various stakeholders in the cassava value chain revealed that food shortage cannot always be explained by supply/demand narratives. The study shows that cassava supply mechanisms in the Abidjan area are not sustainable as the main producers of cassava for sale are migrant workers employed in rubber plantations and whose stability in the region depends on prices of this cash crop on the international market. Regions at the vicinity of Abidjan are supplying the city with cassava but the offer does not meet the requirements of cassava-based food processors who need specific types of the product. Moreover, strategies from the municipal and government authorities to circumvent the shortage often face resistance of populations if local norms and values are not considered. In food strategies, sociocultural dynamics should be considered alongside the complex socioeconomic and environmental factors shaping the social geography of food supply in African cities.","[Mobio, Aubin Jacob; Amanzou, Nogbou Andecthi Aubin; Dao, Daouda] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Mobio, Aubin Jacob; Fokou, Gilbert; Aka, Solange; Kouassi, Kouadio Benal; Kouakou, Kouakou Philipps; Amanzou, Nogbou Andecthi Aubin; Dao, Daouda; Bonfoh, Bassirou] Ctr Suisse Recherches Scientif Cote Div CSRS, 01 BP 1303, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Fokou, Gilbert] Human Sci Res Council HSRC, 116-118 Buitengracht St, Cape Town, South Africa; [Aka, Solange; Kouassi, Kouadio Benal] Univ Nangui Abrogoua, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Kreppel, Katharina Sophia] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Tengeru, Tanzania; [Amanzou, Nogbou Andecthi Aubin] Univ Alassane Ouattara, Bouake, Cote Ivoire; [Bonfoh, Bassirou] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland",Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny; Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire (CSRS); Universite Nangui Abrogoua; Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology; Universite Alassane Ouattara; University of Basel; Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute,"Mobio, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.;Mobio, AJ (corresponding author), Ctr Suisse Recherches Scientif Cote Div CSRS, 01 BP 1303, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",j.mobio@csrs.ci,,,Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire,Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire,This study was entirely funded by Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire.,,54,3,3,0,13,,,,,2193-7532,,,,JAN 11,2021,9,1,,,,,,,2,10.1186/s40100-020-00174-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40100-020-00174-0,,,,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics,,Agriculture; Business & Economics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To answer this question, we develop a Stackelberg game model to capture optimal government decisions. The results indicate that in a market with a high environmental governance cost and a large number of ride -hailing drivers who own traditional vehicles, the government should adopt the control policy; in a market with a low environmental governance cost and a small number of ride -hailing drivers who own traditional vehicles, the government should adopt subsidy policy.

Understanding the interactions and balance of power in agri-food systems is critical to effectively govern sustainability transitions. Here, we conduct a meta-study of 71 case studies in European agri-food systems to synthesise evidence on the diversity of actors and network configurations. We characterise the reported power-laden relationships to generate an agri-food network for each case study and then create a typology of archetypical network configurations. Our study provides three major insights. First, we find a diverse range of actors and complex network configurations. This indicates that the predominant focus on farmers in sustainability policy overlooks the other actors in their agrifood networks, thus risking suboptimal policy design and efficacy. Second, the typology identifies three groups of networks - agro-industrial control, multifunctional value chains, and civic food networks - associated with diverging levels of farmer autonomy. Agricultural governance should therefore consider the context-specific agency of farmers; policies that target farmer decision-making can only have impact if farmers have the capacity to change. Third, the typology demonstrates the potentially complementary roles of conventional and alternative value chains, as well as top-down state support and bottom-up civil society mobilisation. Agri-food networks hence provide diverse leverage points for sustainability transformation.","[Williams, Tim G.; Debonne, Niels; Levers, Christian; Swart, Rebecca; Verburg, Peter H.] VU Univ Amstedam, IVM Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bui, Sibylle] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, Grp Rech Droit Econ & Gest, F-06560 Nice, France; [Conti, Costanza] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Levers, Christian] Fed Res Inst Rural Areas Forestry & Fisheries, Thunen Inst Biodivers, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Braunschweig, Germany; [Verburg, Peter H.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Land Change Sci Res Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Williams, Tim G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, IVM Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog Grp, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Stockholm University; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Williams, TG (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, IVM Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog Grp, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.williams@vu.nl,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [CRSII5_183493]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CRSII5_183493] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation in the project What is Sustainable Intensification?

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Indus-try 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study fur-ther conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequen-tial relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integra-tion, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interre-lated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability de-veloped in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustain-able development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.","[Ghobakhloo, Morteza; Mubarak, Muhammad Faraz] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Iranmanesh, Mohammad] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia; [Mubarik, Mobashar] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Technol Management & Business, Parit Raja, Malaysia; [Rejeb, Abderahman] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Management & Law, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh] UCSI Univ, UCSI Grad Business Sch, 1 Jalan Menara Gading, Kuala Lumpur 56000, Malaysia; [Nilashi, Mehrbakhsh] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Global Sustainabil Studies CGSS, Usm Penang 11800, Malaysia",Kaunas University of Technology; Edith Cowan University; University of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia; University of Rome Tor Vergata; UCSI University; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Ghobakhloo, M (corresponding author), Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania.",morteza.ghobakhloo@ktu.lt; m.iranmanesh@ecu.edu.au; muhammad.mubarak@ktu.lt; Mobashar.com@gmail.com; abderrahmen.rejeb@gmail.com; nilashidotnet@hotmail.com,,,European Union [810318],European Union(European Union (EU)),This research has been a part of a project that received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation pro- gramme under grant agreement No 810318.,,73,170,171,46,262,,,,2352-5509,,,,,SEP,2022,33,,,,,,716,737,,10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.08.003,,AUG 2022,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find a positive association between ESG performance and FSDQ quality, suggesting that improved ESG performance is linked to enhanced disclosure quality and accountability and that managerial competence and strong organizational culture accentuate this relationship. Further analysis shows a stronger link between firms with high-quality accounting practices and good financial reporting readability, whereas complex financial reporting weakens this relationship. Our findings remain valid when alternative measures of key variables are used, and under propensity score analysis, Heckman's two-stage estimation, and cross-lagged and entropy balancing techniques, ensuring the analysis is robust and reliable. Overall, our findings provide important new insights into ESG performance, suggesting it fosters enhanced disclosure and accountability to stakeholders.","[Ferdous, Lutfa Tilat; Yeboah, Richard] Univ Leicester, Business Sch, Leicester, England; [Rana, Tarek] RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Dept Accounting, Melbourne, Australia",University of Leicester; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Rana, T (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Accounting Informat Syst & Supply Chain, Dept Accounting, Melbourne, Australia.",tarek.rana@rmit.edu.au,,,RMIT University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians,RMIT University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians,"Open access publishing facilitated by RMIT University, as part of the Wiley - RMIT University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.",,127,5,5,40,43,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,JAN,2025,34,1,,,,,162,186,,10.1002/bse.3982,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3982,,OCT 2024,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These resilience issues need to be addressed with a focus on the regional context in which farming systems operate because farms, farmers' organizations, service suppliers and supply chain actors are embedded in local environments and functions of agriculture. We define resilience of a farming system as its ability to ensure the provision of the system functions in the face of increasingly complex and accumulating economic, social, environmental and institutional shocks and stresses, through capacities of robustness, adaptability and transformability. We (i) develop a framework to assess the resilience of farming systems, and (ii) present a methodology to operationalize the framework with a view to Europe's diverse farming systems. The framework is designed to assess resilience to specific challenges (specified resilience) as well as a farming system's capacity to deal with the unknown, uncertainty and surprise (general resilience). The framework provides a heuristic to analyze system properties, challenges (shocks, long-term stresses), indicators to measure the performance of system functions, resilience capacities and resilience-enhancing attributes. Capacities and attributes refer to adaptive cycle processes of agricultural practices, farm demographics, governance and risk management. The novelty of the framework pertains to the focal scale of analysis, i.e. the farming system level, the consideration of accumulating challenges and various agricultural processes, and the consideration that farming systems provide multiple functions that can change over time. Furthermore, the distinction between three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, transformability) ensures that the framework goes beyond narrow definitions that limit resilience to robustness. The methodology deploys a mixed-methods approach: quantitative methods, such as statistics, econometrics and modelling, are used to identify underlying patterns, causal explanations and likely contributing factors; while qualitative methods, such as interviews, participatory approaches and stakeholder workshops, access experiential and contextual knowledge and provide more nuanced insights. More specifically, analysis along the framework explores multiple nested levels of farming systems (e.g. farm, farm household, supply chain, farming system) over a time horizon of 1-2 generations, thereby enabling reflection on potential temporal and scalar trade-offs across resilience attributes. The richness of the framework is illustrated for the arable farming system in Veenkolonien, the Netherlands. The analysis reveals a relatively low capacity of this farming system to transform and farmers feeling distressed about transformation, while other members of their households have experienced many examples of transformation.","[Meuwissen, Miranda P.

Institutional economics is arguably the most important subdiscipline of economics in enabling an inter-disciplinary and systems approach to ensure sustainable economy solutions. The purpose and academic contribution of the paper is to conduct the first systematic review of existing institutional economics frameworks that can be applied to explore sustainable development. The scientific value added of the review is to draw out, cluster, compare and contrast: the focus, contribution, use and institutional approaches of studies, as well as sector applicability, aims of sustainable development addressed and key gaps. Results show that most frameworks can be classed as applying new institutional economics approaches (or similar) and focus on common property or social ecological systems. Most of these frameworks see institutions as rules and often have a strong focus on formal rules. Another key finding is that most frameworks address the environmental aim of sustainable development, but few address all three aims. There was also found to be a lack of frameworks with a foreground focus on the end consumer and downstream supply chains that drive resources use and environmental impact. Classical institutional economics is largely neglected by most frameworks, yet classical institutional economics can inform the cultural shift to more sustainable economies, because of its focus on a wider range of informal institutions.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

A set of three low-carbon 'Transition Pathways' were developed to examine the influence of different governance arrangements on achieving a low-carbon future. They focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport. These transition pathways were developed by starting from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stake-holders and analysis of historical analogies. Here the quantified pathways are compared and contrasted with the main scenarios developed in the UK Government's 2011 Carbon Plan. This can aid an informed debate on the technical feasibility and social acceptability of realising transition pathways for decarbonising the UK energy sector by 2050. The contribution of these pathways to meeting Britain's energy and carbon reduction goals are therefore evaluated on a 'whole systems' basis, including the implications of 'upstream emissions' arising from the 'fuel supply chain' ahead of power generators themselves.","[Barton, John; Thomson, Murray] Loughborough Univ Technol, CREST, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Davies, Lloyd; Dooley, Ben] Univ Leeds, Sch Proc Environm & Mat Engn, Ctr Doctoral Training Low Carbon Technol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Foxon, Timothy J.] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Galloway, Stuart; Robertson, Elizabeth] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Glasgow G1 1XW, Lanark, Scotland; [Hammond, Geoffrey P.; O'Grady, Aine] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Loughborough University; University of Leeds; University of Sussex; University of Strathclyde; University of Bath,"Hammond, GP (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",g.p.hammond@bath.ac.uk,,,"UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); E.On UK (the integrated energy company) [EP/F022832/1]; EPSRC [EP/K005316/1, EP/G036608/1]; EPSRC [EP/F022832/1, EP/K005316/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); E.On UK (the integrated energy company); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This is an extended and updated version of a paper originally presented at the 10th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES 2015) held in Dubrovnik, Croatia over the period 27 September - 2 October 2015 (denoted then as paper SDEWES2015.00656).

Temperate-zone agroecological systems that are currently organized for production of summer-annual crops can be diversified by integration of fallow-season and perennial crops. Integration of such crops can improve sustainability of these agroecological systems, with minimal interference with current agricultural production. Importantly, these crops can provide feedstocks for a wide range of new bio-products that are forming a new agricultural bioeconomy, potentially providing greatly increased economic incentives for diversification. However, while there are many fallow-season and perennial crops that might be used in such a bioeconomic strategy for diversification, most are not yet well adapted and highly-marketable. Efforts are underway to enhance adaptation and marketability of many such crops. Critically, these efforts require a strategic approach that addresses the inherent complexity of these projects. We outline a suitable approach, which we term sustainable commercialization: a coordinated innovation process that integrates a new crop into the agriculture of a region, while intentionally addressing economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges via multi-stakeholder governance. This approach centers on a concerted effort to coordinate and govern innovation in three critical areas: germplasm development, multifunctional agroecosystem design and management, and development of end uses, supply chains, and markets. To exemplify the approach, we describe an ongoing effort to commercialize a new fallow-season crop, field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.).","[Jordan, N. R.; Ewing, P.; Williams, A.; Anderson, K.

Bangladesh, a key player in the global textile supply chain and one of the top producers, contributes significantly to these emissions. However, accessible data on activity and GHG emissions, crucial for researchers, the private sector, and policymakers in decision-making, is scarce. To address this gap, this study combines a detailed field survey with expert interviews to establish a comprehensive emission inventory. This inventory aims to identify hotspots and facilitate the adoption of effective mitigation strategies. Focusing on a prominent industrial zone's textile and readymade garments (RMG) industries, the research employs a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches and follows the IPCC guidelines to develop a GHG emission inventory for 2022. The study evaluates various emission sources, including scope 1 (onsite fuel combustions), scope 2 (grid electricity usage), and scope 3 (waste and wastewater treatment). In the total emissions (6043.5 Gg CO(2)eq.), textile and RMG industries contribute 67.8% and 32.2%, respectively, with scope 1 emissions dominating at 85%. Notably, scope 2 emissions exhibit significant uncertainty (-10.4% to +11.9%), largely due to variations in national grid emission factors. This study forecasts GHG emissions until 2030, considering current trends (26 thousand Gg CO2 eq.). It also explores various energy mix scenarios, factoring in the depletion of existing natural gas reserves (ranging from 8 thousand to 33 thousand Gg CO2 eq.).

The global market for critical minerals is highly vulnerable due to supply chain monopoly risks. Moreover, the mining, processing and refining of these elements involves substantial environmental and health risks, including, but not limited to, ecosystem degradation, chemical pollution, and hazards related to chemical and particulate exposure. Countries such as Australia, therefore, have developed national critical minerals strategies, which include investment in research to develop improved recovery methods and processing technologies. Australia has escalated continuous flow chemistry and critical minerals as critical priorities of national interest. In lieu of this, this review paper assesses the role of solvent extraction and other processing innovations using microchannel systems for the recovery of critical minerals. Microfluidic devices have captured worldwide attention for miniaturising reactor dimensions and, hence, provide huge potential for advancing the application of chemical processes that require precise control, enhanced mixing and rapid reactions. For mineral processing, continuous-flow operation can lead to advantages for extraction efficiency, processing time (productivity), and selectivity. Thus, this review summarises the up-to-date extraction performance of microfluidic devices along classes of critical minerals, as defined by their grouping in the periodic table. Attention is given to the fluidic concept used, e.g. the flow patterns, and how the microfluidic system is configured. From there, the achieved performance is reviewed, both for model and real world extractant solutions, the latter includes multiple minerals and issues of selectivity. Finally, a proposed recommendation is that microfluidics used should aim to impact the whole processing and supply chain, and to support and contribute to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) profiling, a crucial demand faced by the mining industry. The enabling technologies not only have the potential to change the environmental profile, but will also require a highly skilled and trained workforce, and hence can create new employment opportunities.","[Le, Tu Nguyen Quang; Tran, Quy Don; Tran, Nam Nghiep; Goodsite, Michael; Hessel, Volker] Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn & Adv Mat, Adelaide, Australia; [Tran, Nam Nghiep] Can Tho Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Priest, Craig; Skinner, William] Univ South Australia, Future Ind Inst, Adelaide, Australia; [Spandler, Carl; Cook, Nigel John] Univ Adelaide, Australian Crit Minerals Res Ctr, Adelaide, Australia; [Goodsite, Michael; Cook, Nigel John] Univ Adelaide, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Resources, Adelaide, Australia; [Cook, Nigel John] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, Australia; [Hessel, Volker] Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry, England; [Spandler, Carl] Univ Adelaide, Dept Earth Sci, Adelaide, Australia",University of Adelaide; Can Tho University; University of South Australia; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of Warwick; University of Adelaide,"Hessel, V (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn & Adv Mat, Adelaide, Australia.;Hessel, V (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry, England.",volker.hessel@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,167,9,9,12,51,,,,1463-9262,1463-9270,,,,NOV 28,2022,24,23,,,,,8879,8898,,10.1039/d2gc02214a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2gc02214a,,OCT 2022,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Located on the southwest outskirts of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, Rio Tinto's Kennecott mine not only produces so-called 'energy transition materials,' but also emerges as an industry exemplar in advancing environmental mediation, modernization, and decarbonization strategies. Employing participant observation, drawing on 31 semi-structured interviews and 7 focus groups, this article explores the intersections between extractive subjectivities and green extractivism. While Rio Tinto's Kennecott mine ranks among the highest towards environmental, social, and governance standards, we argue that the more enlightened and self-reflective a mining company becomes the more it entrenches a damaging extractive subjectivity. Revealing techniques employed by the company, we demonstrate how 'enlightened' or green extractivist approaches prolong mining, delay transformative socioecological restoration and reinforce existing extractive subjectivities to produce grey extractivism.","[Dunlap, Alexander A.; Novakovic, Bojana; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Boston Univ, Inst Global Sustainabil, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Dunlap, Alexander A.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Global Dev Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA USA",Boston University; University of Helsinki; Boston University,"Dunlap, AA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Inst Global Sustainabil, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Dunlap, AA (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Global Dev Studies, Helsinki, Finland.",alexander.a.dunlap@gmail.com,,,Alfred P.

Evidence from China,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY,,,,Article,,,,,,ESG performance; Climate risk; Heterogeneity analysis; China,SUPPLY CHAINS; CORPORATE,"Owing to its devastating nature, climate risk has become one of the top concerns of the world community. The literature on the effects of climate risk on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance is scarce. Using data from Chinese A-share listed firms from 2010 to 2019, this study aims to determine whether climate risk affects firms' ESG performance. The findings show that climate risk has a detrimental effect on the ESG performance of Chinese firms. A heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative effect of climate risk on firms' ESG performance is most pronounced for state-owned firms, growing and declining firms, and firms with more institutional investor shareholders. Furthermore, a mechanistic analysis shows that financing constraints, corporate diversification, and media attention enhance the negative effect of climate risk on ESG. In addition, after addressing several robustness checks and endogeneity issues, our conclusions remain valid. Thus, this study indicates the need to develop a comprehensive policy to achieve development goals by considering and valuing the impact of climate risk on firm's ESG performance.","[Chen, Yongtai] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Engn Audit, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yi-Shuai] Hunan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yi-Shuai] Hunan Univ, Res Inst Digital Soc & Blockchain, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yi-Shuai] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Ren, Yi-Shuai] Univ Auckland, Energy Ctr, Auckland, New Zealand; [Narayan, Seema] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Melbourne, Australia; [Huynh, Ngoc Quang Anh] UEH Univ, Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Coll Technol & Design, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam",Nanjing Audit University; Hunan University; Hunan University; Hunan University; University of Auckland; Monash University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Ren, YS (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Changsha, Peoples R China.",renyishuai1989@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72104075]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2022JJ40106]; Social Sciences Foundation of Jiangsu Province [19EYB020]; Hunan University Youth Talent Program,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Social Sciences Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Hunan University Youth Talent Program,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No. 72104075) ; the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2022JJ40106) ; the Social Sciences Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 19EYB020) ; and the Hunan University Youth Talent Program.,,57,28,28,74,201,,,,0313-5926,,,,,MAR,2024,81,,,,,,683,695,,10.1016/j.eap.2023.12.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2023.12.028,,DEC 2023,,Economics,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unlike the extant literature that has emphasized stakeholder and regulatory pressures, this paper argues that voluntary carbon disclosure is both beneficial and costly for corporations with respect to the existence of supportive management structures, explicit CSR practices, and the existence of complementary assets. Moreover, there is variation between European firms and other global businesses because of Europe's distinctive national business systems framework in conjunction with global supply chain imperatives. Empirically, this study employs a novel discrete-continuous modeling approach to distinguish between a corporation's decision to disclose and the linked but subsequent decision of how much to disclose climate change information. Results indicate that the main drivers of participation in voluntary carbon disclosure by the Global 500 firms is the existence of senior managers and executive-level officers and the adoption of ESG principles by global businesses. Conditional on participation, European Union-based and other global businesses that articulate a corporate vision for environmental sustainability, adopt ESG principles, and invest in complementary assets disclose climate change strategies and emissions at higher levels than companies without these internal firm capabilities. This study has implications for national climate policy and global climate change governance more generally, both of which increasingly focus on concrete climate solutions by corporations.","[Hsueh, Lily] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 455, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Hsueh, L (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 455, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",Lily.Hsueh@asu.edu,,,,,,,101,56,57,12,152,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,NOV,2019,28,7,,,,,1302,1322,,10.1002/bse.2317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2317,,,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While investing in and constructing new infrastructure is great for the economy, it has also added to the carbon emissions of major cities. The product design industry has recently become increasingly interested in creating and pricing cultural and creative goods in specific provinces. Thanks to the burgeoning global cultural and creative sector, a new platform has opened up for the evolution and modernization of China's ancient cultural practices. Cultural creativity has broken the rigid design and production pattern of traditional products from a business point of view, increasing their economic advantages and competition. Also, this study examines ICT's main and moderate effect on carbon emissions in the 27 provinces of China's economy from 2003 to 2019 using panel estimators. The estimated outcomes show the positive contribution to environmental damages by physical capital, tourism, cultural product prices, innovative, creative prices, and trade openness, while ICT significantly reduces emissions. Besides the moderate role of the digital economy on physical capital, tourism, CP, ICP, and tourism significantly reduce CO2 emissions.

With the growing importance of sustainability practices, emerging technologies have the potential to revolutionize reporting methods. However, there is a lack of research on the factors influencing the adoption of blockchain and cloud-based sustainability accounting in China. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine the key drivers and barriers to technology adoption for sustainability reporting among Chinese businesses. Through a systematic literature review, gaps in knowledge were identified. Primary data was collected through an online survey of firms, followed by in-depth case studies. The findings of the study reveal a positive relationship between company size and reporting behaviors. However, size alone is not sufficient to predict outcomes accurately. The industry type also has significant but small effects, although its impact on reporting behaviors varies. The relationship between profitability and reporting behaviors is intricate and contingent, requiring contextual examination. The adoption of blockchain technology is positively associated with capabilities, resources, skills, and regulatory factors. On the other hand, cloud computing adoption is linked to resources, management support, and risk exposures. However, the specific impacts of industry on adoption remain inconclusive. This study aims to offer empirical validation of relationships, shedding light on the intricate nature of interactions that necessitate nuanced conceptualizations incorporating contextual moderators. The findings underscore the importance of providing customized support and adaptable guidance to accommodate the evolving practices in sustainability accounting. Moreover, the assimilation of technology and organizational changes highlights the need for multifaceted stakeholder cooperation to drive responsible innovation and address the challenges posed by digital transformations in this field.","[Tian, Zhouyu] Yan'an Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Yanan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhouyu] Suzhou Univ, Business Sch, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhouyu] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Lening] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Discipline Inspection & Supervis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Litao] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Yanan University; Suzhou University; Shenyang Agricultural University; China University of Political Science & Law; Shanghai Ocean University,"Wang, LT (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",LitaoWang11011@sohu.com,,,"Shengyang Economic and Social Development Special Project [SYSK20200708]; Research project of economic and social development of Liaoning Province [2020lsljdybkt53]; Liaoning Provincial Social Science Planning Fund [L21BGL036, L22BTJ016]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research Youth Program of the Ministry of Education [20YJC630025]; Suzhou University Doctoral Research Initiation Fund Project [2023BSK031]; National Social Science Foundation of China [20BGL214]",Shengyang Economic and Social Development Special Project; Research project of economic and social development of Liaoning Province; Liaoning Provincial Social Science Planning Fund; Humanities and Social Sciences Research Youth Program of the Ministry of Education; Suzhou University Doctoral Research Initiation Fund Project; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors would like to acknowledge the following grants that provided support for this study:1.

However, such initiatives may not effectively reduce deforestation if they are not aligned with the spatial extent of remaining forests at risk. They may also fail to avert socio-economic risks if ZDCs do not consider smallholder farmers' needs. We assess the spatial and functional fit of ZDCs by mapping commodity-driven deforestation and socio-economic risks, and comparing them to the spatial coverage and implementation of ZDCs in the Indonesian palm oil sector. Our study finds that companies' ZDCs often underperform in four areas: traceability, compliance support for high-risk palm oil mills, transparency, and smallholder inclusion. In 2020, only one-third of companies sourcing from their own mills, and just 6% of those sourcing from external suppliers, achieved full traceability to plantations. Comparing the reach of ZDCs adopted by downstream buyers with those adopted by mill owners located further upstream, we find that high-quality ZDCs from buyers covered 62% of forests at risk, while mill owners' ZDCs only covered 23% of forests at risk within the mill supply base. In Kalimantan and Papua, the current and future deforestation frontiers, the forests most at risk of conversion were predominantly covered by weak ZDCs lacking in policy comprehensiveness and implementation. Additionally, we find that only 46% of independent smallholder oil palm plots are in mill supply sheds whose owners offer programs and support for independent smallholders, indicating that smallholder inclusion is a significant challenge for ZDC companies. These results highlight the lack of spatial and functional alignment between supply chain policies and their local context as a significant gap in ZDC implementation and a challenge that the EU Deforestation Regulation will face.","[Chandra, Adelina; Garrett, Rachael D.; Stigler, Matthieu; Grabs, Janina] Dept Environm Syst Sci, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Garrett, Rachael D.] Univ Cambridge, Conservat Res Inst, Cambridge, England; [Carlson, Kimberly M.] NYU, Dept Environm Studies, New York, NY USA; [Heilmayr, Robert; Benedict, Jason J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Environm Studies Program, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Heilmayr, Robert; Benedict, Jason J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Grabs, Janina] Univ Ramon Llull, ESADE Business Sch, Ave Torre Blanca 59, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08172, Spain",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; New York University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Chandra, A (corresponding author), Dept Environm Syst Sci, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",achandra@ethz.ch,,,US National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),No Statement Available,,68,1,1,7,12,,,,1748-9326,,,,,APR 1,2024,19,4,,,,,,,44054,10.1088/1748-9326/ad33d1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad33d1,,,,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concurrently, an evolving regulatory environment mandates publicly listed companies to report on ESG and climate emissions, taking into account supply chain risks as well. As a result, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly asked as suppliers to present a credible sustainability certificate. The esg2go rating and reporting system aims at improving the credibility and practicality of corporate sustainability assessment. It was jointly developed with its users and relevant stakeholders and is based on a calibrated benchmarking system from verifiable data. The rating method enables the measurement and comparison of sector- and firm size-specific sustainability performance. Its underlying adaptive parametrization is derived from a coherent and pragmatic definition of SME sustainability as the 'ability to co-exist'.

The wire and cable sector must urgently pursue sustainability due to its heavy reliance on resource-intensive materials like copper and plastic. Adapting to stricter global environmental regulations and meeting the increasing demand for eco-friendly products are essential for maintaining competitiveness and compliance in the industry. This study introduces an innovative hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model, named FFS-DEMATEL-TOPSIS, which effectively integrates the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodologies. Enhanced with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs), this model is designed to assess sustainable development strategies and evaluate current performance metrics comprehensively. This study primarily focuses on four dimensions of sustainability within the wire and cable sector, including environmental, social, corporate governance, and risk management. These dimensions are further expanded into 12 core criteria, providing a comprehensive framework for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices in the industry. The study results reveal that the top five criteria with the highest impact weights are board functionality, pollution zero emission, product carbon footprint, business risk, and supply chain management. Decision-makers should focus on comprehensively reviewing the current state of these areas and devise appropriate improvement strategies to enhance their performance. Notably, board functionality significantly influences other criteria, underscoring the importance of executive support in implementing sustainable development. This model and evaluation framework can serve as a foundation for assessing sustainability performance in other industries.","[Tsai, Jung-Fa; Shen, Shih-Ping] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Business Management, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 106344, Taiwan; [Lin, Ming-Hua] Univ Taipei, Dept Urban Ind Management & Mkt, 101,Sec 2,Zhongcheng Rd, Taipei 111036, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology,"Lin, MH (corresponding author), Univ Taipei, Dept Urban Ind Management & Mkt, 101,Sec 2,Zhongcheng Rd, Taipei 111036, Taiwan.",jftsai@ntut.edu.tw; gactech.steven@gmail.com; mhlin@utaipei.edu.tw,,,"National Science and Technology Council in Taiwan [NSTC 111-2410-H-027-006, NSTC 112-2410-H-027-005-MY2, NSTC 111-2410-H-845 -012-MY2]",National Science and Technology Council in Taiwan,"This research was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council in Taiwan under Grants NSTC 111-2410-H-027-006, NSTC 112-2410-H-027-005-MY2, and NSTC 111-2410-H-845 -012-MY2.",,39,1,1,3,8,,,,1618-954X,1618-9558,,,,MAR,2025,27,3,,,,,1115,1130,,10.1007/s10098-024-02897-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10098-024-02897-w,,JUN 2024,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system is an effective way to deal with the problems aroused from wrap tires in some countries. In order to analyze the driving factors for the EPR system in the Chinese tire industry, this study first identifies the key driving factors based on literature analysis, expert interviews, and field research. And then, using the grey decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (Grey-DEMATEL) method, the interrelationships among these factors were quantified analyzed. We find that the causal factor is to strengthen the service function of dealers and service providers and improve the satisfaction of sales channels. Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure the robustness of the results. Conclusions are summarized below. If the implementation of the EPR system for tire companies can promote the sales of new tires, achieving the economic and environmental benefits must be the most critical factor. The effect factor is to fulfill social responsibility and achieve the brand effect. This result is in line with the original intention of tire companies to fulfill social responsibility and realize resource recycling. The key factors are related to policy guidance and regulations at the national level. And managerial implications are suggested for promoting the EPR system in China tire industry.","[Hu Houbao; Chen Qiang] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Liu Junjun] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Fac Business Adm, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Liu, JJ (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Fac Business Adm, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",liujunj@swufe.edu.cn,,,Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation [21ZDA018],Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation,This work was supported by the Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation (grant number 21ZDA018).,,47,1,1,5,17,,,,1024-123X,1563-5147,,,,MAR 28,2022,2022,,,,,,,,4327074,10.1155/2022/4327074,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/4327074,,,,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",,Engineering; Mathematics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new integrated sustainability assessment framework (ISAF) is required to evaluate cross-cutting subjects and future research. Sustainability analysis based on conventional dimensions and complementary categories is needed for a digital energy transition. Industry 4.0 created a new platform and technological portfolio to improve the efficiency and automation of cleaner energy systems (lower environmental and social impacts and high performance). To address these aspects, a new methodology based on bibliometric analysis, systematic literature review, and energy systems thinking was developed. From Scopus and Web of Science databases, 1521 and 959 documents were respectively compiled and merged to select 181 articles related to these research subjects between 2017 and 2021. Out of this total, 62 articles from industrial manufacturing were identified as the most representative energy consumption sub-sector. These articles were analysed from the ISAF using conventional dimensions (environmental, economic, and social) and complementary categories of sustainability (technological innovation, governance and life cycle). The main findings reveal that worldwide studies addressing the nexus between Industry 4.0, Energy and Sustainability have increased significantly in recent years, primaly in high-income countries. These studies have centred on the industrial manufacturing subsector, assessing sustainability unevenly by focusing mainly on technological and environmental issues. Research gaps indicate that a comprehensive assessment of social, governance, and life cycle aspects is still required.","[Vallarta-Serrano, Stephany Isabel; Santoyo-Castelazo, Edgar; Vazquez-Sanchez, Holkan] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Mexico City 14380, Mexico; [Santoyo, Edgar; Garcia-Mandujano, Esther O.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Energias Renovables, Temixco 62580, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Santoyo-Castelazo, E (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Mexico City 14380, Mexico.",a00953860@tec.mx; esantoyo@tec.mx; esg@ier.unam.mx; eogm@ier.unam.mx; a01262326@exatec.tec.mx,,,,,,,160,8,8,5,36,,,,,1996-1073,,,,JUL,2023,16,14,,,,,,,5440,10.3390/en16145440,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16145440,,,,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on our collaborative research with these organizations and a review of their public statements, the paper identifies the values that guide their work. The paper then draws on the evidence of a series of workshops which revealed some of the challenges the partnerships face as they seek to put their values into practice, focusing on governance issues (and related funding challenges) and the implementation of equity, diversity and inclusion policies. Our findings show that the partnerships' work is consistent with the concept of values-based food systems though they do not use the term themselves. Our research also shows the range of work being undertaken by these local food partnerships with much in common but also some significant divergence in their activities.

By categorizing and aggregating insights from the empirical data and the relevant literature, the paper identifies country reputational risk as a factor determining the firm?s propensity to exclude specific offshore locations. However, its effect is contingent upon managers? interpretation of the critical elements of the business environment in a particular country. Thus, the study contributes by demystifying the role of ?managerial inputs?, which are often neglected within international sourcing literature. Further, reputational risk is delineated as a higher-order construct comprised of three lower-order constructs: unethical practices, institutional weakness, and quality concerns. Our findings distinguish reputational risk from the CSR framework because the dimensions of reputational risk identified in this study transcend beyond the governance, ethics, environmental and social spheres of CSR.

To this end, 145 publications were identified using a systematic literature review. The results revealed eight key areas of DT implementation including (i) virtual design, (ii) project planning and management, (iii) asset management and maintenance, (iv) safety management, (v) energy efficiency and sustainability, (vi) quality control and management, (vii) supply chain management and logistics, and (viii) structural health monitoring. The findings demonstrate that DT technology has the capacity to revolutionise the construction industry across these areas, enabling optimised designs, improved collaboration, real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, enhanced safety practices, energy performance optimisation, quality inspections, efficient supply chain management, and proactive maintenance. This study also identified several challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DT in construction, including (i) data integration and interoperability, (ii) data accuracy and completeness, (iii) scalability and complexity, (iv) privacy and security, and (v) standards and governance. To address these challenges, this paper recommends prioritising standardised data formats, protocols, and APIs for seamless collaboration, exploring semantic data modelling and ontologies for data integration, implementing validation processes and robust data governance for accuracy and completeness, harnessing high-performance computing and advanced modelling techniques for scalability and complexity, establishing comprehensive data protection and access controls for privacy and security, and developing widely accepted standards and governance frameworks with industry-wide collaboration. By addressing these challenges, the construction industry can unlock the full potential of DT technology, thus enhancing safety, reliability, and efficiency in construction projects.","[Omrany, Hossein; Husain, Amreen] Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Adelaide 5005, Australia; [Al-Obaidi, Karam M.] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Coll Social Sci & Arts, Dept Nat & Built Environm, Sheffield S1 1WB, England; [Ghaffarianhoseini, Amirhosein] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Future Environm, Dept Built Environm Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Adelaide; Sheffield Hallam University; Auckland University of Technology,"Omrany, H (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Adelaide 5005, Australia.",hossein.omrany@adelaide.edu.au; k.al-obaidi@shu.ac.uk; amreen.husain@student.adelaide.edu.au; amirhosein.ghaffarianhoseini@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,131,43,43,16,113,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUL,2023,15,14,,,,,,,10908,10.3390/su151410908,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151410908,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our inquiry analyzes the extent to which companies explicitly or implicitly incorporate stakeholder perspectives into their risk management practices. Based on the four fundamental pillars of risk management outlined by the Institute of Risk Management (IRM 2002), this study seeks to elucidate the multidimensional and comprehensive nature of stakeholder engagement in risk management processes. This study is based on a content analysis of 253 sustainability reports and Non-Financial Statements drawn from different categories of companies representing the Italian market: large companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), cooperatives, and public utilities. The results reveal that companies primarily address risk management and control in their reports, aligning with the literature. Although risk components are equally important in managing adverse events, the results show a high percentage of risk analysis unlike what emerged from the literature, and a smaller percentage of companies focused on risk monitoring and risk communication. Stakeholder engagement levels vary based on company type and the activities performed in the risk governance process. From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to systemic risk management research by integrating stakeholders into risk governance models. From a managerial perspective, this study offers implications for both risk management and sustainability disclosure practices.

A consistent and accurate quantification of their GHG emissions is an important prerequisite for the success of such efforts. However, emissions embodied in domestic and international supply chains, that can undermine the effectiveness of climate agreements, add challenges to the quantification of emissions originating from the consumption of goods and services produced elsewhere. We examine emission transfers between the states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance (USCA) and others. Our results show that states pledging to curb emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement were responsible for approximately 40% of total U.S. territorial GHG emissions. However, when accounting for transferred emissions through international and interstate supply chains of the products they consume, the share of Alliance states increased to 52.4% of the national total GHG emissions. The consumption-based emissions for some Alliance states, such as Massachusetts and New York, could be more than 1.5 times higher than their production-based emissions. Our detailed sectoral analysis highlights the challenges facing such agreements to extend cooperation in the future for larger joint benefit given the potential for carbon leakage from member states implementing stricter environmental policies that could lead to higher emissions from non-member states. It is critical for these arrangements to pay close attention to transferred emissions.","[Song, Kaihui; Baiocchi, Giovanni; Feng, Kuishuang; Sun, Laixiang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Song, Kaihui] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Data Driven EnviroLab, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Baiocchi, Giovanni] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hubacek, Klaus] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen ESRIG, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Sun, Laixiang] SOAS Univ London, Sch Finance & Management, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Wang, Daoping] Univ Cambridge, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Cambridge CB3 0FD, England; [Guan, Dabo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guan, Dabo] UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 6BT, England",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Groningen; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Cambridge; Tsinghua University; University of London; University College London,"Baiocchi, G (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",baiocchi@umd.edu,,,University of Maryland College of Behavioral and Social Science (BSOS) Dean?s Research Initiative; [2953980],University of Maryland College of Behavioral and Social Science (BSOS) Dean?s Research Initiative;,Acknowledgments University of Maryland College of Behavioral and Social Science (BSOS) Dean?s Research Initiative 2953980 (KS) .,,80,10,10,3,28,,,,0959-3780,1872-9495,,,,NOV,2022,77,,,,,,,,102596,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102596,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102596,,NOV 2022,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is touted by governments and industry as essential to a clean, just energy transition. However, critiques reveal tensions between this ideal and the realities of lithium extraction, questioning whether it represents a continuation of extractive capitalism or a pathway to sustainable development grounded in social and environmental justice. Our critical review of the literature synthesizes lithium supply chain dynamics and interdisciplinary critiques of lithium extractivism. It exposes the contradictions and challenges in relying on lithium for climate solutions. Key issues include high water usage, toxic waste, COQ emissions, and deepening global inequalities along racial and class lines. We argue that meaningful reform requires both local engagement with affected communities, especially Indigenous groups, and robust state policies to democratize the extraction process.","[Dowling, Carmel; Otero, Gerardo] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Int Studies, 7200-515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Otero, G (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Int Studies, 7200-515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada.",otero@sfu.ca,,,,,,,97,0,0,6,6,,,,2214-6296,2214-6326,,,,JAN,2025,119,,,,,,,,103862,10.1016/j.erss.2024.103862,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2024.103862,,NOV 2024,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the existing value chain or the trade of intermediate goods decomposition method cannot completely account for the carbon content of intermediate goods. So the paper developed a accounting model for inter-regional intermediate goods trade based on input-output model. The most significant advantage of this accounting model is that by further decomposing final output into three components-final consumption within the region, final consumption flowing to other regions, and final output flowing to other regions as intermediate goods that are not returned to the region-it achieves a more comprehensive decomposition of the value chain in comparison to the established models. This approach allows for the tracking of longer value chains and the accounting for intermediate goods inflows and outflows simultaneously. Furthermore, the accounting of trade in intermediate goods can be conducted for any number of countries, regions, and sectors within the input-output system, thereby providing a foundation for the comprehensive accounting of inter-regional carbon transfers within production networks. With the input-output tables and carbon emission inventories from the CEADs (the China Carbon Emissions Accounting Database), the paper has calculated the changes of the carbon transfer among provinces in the China's domestic production network from 2012 to 2017 and find that the inter-provincial intermediate goods trade and carbon transfer among provinces is increasing significantly. Each province has a strong incentive to overuse the carbon embodied in the intermediate goods from others, but lacks the motivation to reduce their own carbon emission. In the inter-provincial transfer of the carbon content of intermediate goods in China's domestic production network, the difference between the average value of the ratio of the carbon content of intermediate goods from other provinces used by each province and that supplied for use by other provinces to the ratio of the carbon content of intermediate goods produced by itself increased by 13.6% between 2012 and 2017. Only a few provinces are evolving towards a win-win between economic and environmental benefits, while most are still facing the evolutionary dilemma in choosing between economic and environmental benefits. In the future, we should comprehensively explore the cooperative governance of carbon emission reduction in the domestic production network, including establishing a national standard for calculating the carbon transfer in domestic production network, improving the carbon emission responsibility sharing mechanism and carbon emission reduction compensation systems.","[Yang, Puhang] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yong] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; Southwest University of Political Science & Law - China,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",changdeyangyong@163.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [23XGJ010]; Major Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission of China [22SKGH001],National Social Science Fund of China; Major Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission of China,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

To date, however, research has yet to focus on assessing the legitimacy of MSIs in their interactions with other actors within larger systems of deliberation. Drawing on the deliberative systems perspective developed within deliberative democracy theory, we theorise a normative framework to evaluate the roles of MSIs within the broader systems of governance they co-construct through their interactions with other initiatives, governments, non-governmental organisations, and other external actors. As we demonstrate in our evaluation of the illustrative case of the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety as a MSI in the context of the Bangladeshi garment industry, this framework can help researchers assess whether a MSI ultimately serves to enhance or undermine the deliberative legitimacy of the overall system of which it forms a part.","[Apffelstaedt, Kristin] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Schrage, Stephanie] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Gilbert, Dirk Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Business Eth & Management, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Kiel; University of Hamburg,"Gilbert, DU (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Business Eth & Management, Hamburg, Germany.",dirk.gilbert@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,We thank associate editors Juliane Reinecke and Andreas Rasche and the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable guidance in developing this article.

Cephalopod (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) fisheries can contribute to food security; however, their sustainable exploitation requires understanding connections between nature's contributions to people (NCP), food system policies and human wellbeing. Our global literature review methodology examined what is known about cephalopod food systems, value chains and supply chains, and associated market drivers. For analysis, we followed the IPBES conceptual framework to build a map of the links between cephalopod market drivers, NCP and good quality of life (GQL). Then we mapped cephalopod food system dynamics onto IPBES (in)direct drivers of change relating to catch, trade and consumption. This research contributes knowledge about key factors relating to cephalopods that can support transitions towards increased food security: the value of new aquatic food species; food safety and authenticity systems; place-based innovations and empowerment of communities; and consumer behaviour, lifestyle and motivations for better health and environmental sustainability along the food value chain. We outline requirements for a sustainable, equitable cephalopod food system policy landscape that values nature's contributions to people, considers UN Sustainable Development Goals and emphasises the role of seven overlapping IPBES (in)direct drivers of change: Economic, Governance, Sociocultural and Socio-psychological, Technological, Direct Exploitation, Natural Processes and Pollution. We present a novel market-based adaptation of the IPBES conceptual framework-our 'cephalopod food system framework', to represent how the cephalopod food system functions and how it can inform processes to improve sustainability and equity of the cephalopod food system. This synthesised knowledge provides the basis for diagnosing opportunities (e.g. high demand for products) and constraints (e.g. lack of data about how supply chain drivers link to cephalopod NCP) to be considered regarding the role of cephalopods in transformations towards a resilient and more diversified seafood production system. This social-ecological systems approach could apply to other wild harvest commodities with implications for diverse marine species and ecosystems and can inform those working to deliver marine and terrestrial food security while preserving biodiversity.

We need more holistic approaches that encompass all forest values across the landscape, rather than the current approach of dividing public forest management up across different government agencies. More collaborative approaches will be required to galvanise the resources, skills and knowledge that enables this shift in shared governance. Recent bushfires in Australia have heightened concerns that the management of public forest lands has largely failed to ensure the health of forest ecosystems, build resilience, and secure a promised balance between economic, social and environmental values. Investment in efforts to adapt forest management to address climate change has been limited; and empowering and increasing the role of Indigenous Australians in forest management could be significantly improved. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to improve the resilience of regional communities to major shocks and stresses caused by factors that encompass market dynamics, supply-chain disruptions and natural disasters. Three key strategies are proposed to strengthen forest management in Australia: first, establishing new shared governance models that bring together government agencies with Indigenous Australians and actors from the private sector and civil society; second, extending active and adaptive management across forest landscapes that builds resilience in our forests, local communities and society; and third, integrating traditional knowledge with scientific evidence and innovative technologies to enhance forest management for improved resilience and other outcomes.","[Jackson, W.] Intellagama Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Freeman, M.] Hollow Wood Enterprises Pty Ltd, Toorak, Australia; [Freeman, B.] Indufor Asia Pacific, Strategy & Sustainabil, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Parry-Husbands, H.] Pollinate, Surry Hills, Australia",Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance,"Jackson, W (corresponding author), Intellagama Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",william.jackson@intellagama.com,,,,,,,58,8,8,4,54,,,,0004-9158,2325-6087,,,,APR 3,2021,84,2,,,,,50,58,,10.1080/00049158.2021.1894383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2021.1894383,,MAR 2021,,Forestry,,Forestry,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been argued that CS practices have the potential of delivering value for port users and, as such, grant port operators and port managing entities competitive advantages. There is, however, limited evidence behind this claim. The difficulty with collecting such evidence is that we lack measures of port value creation, and CS metrics have rarely been developed and applied in ports. This paper provides a framework for collecting empirical evidence aimed at assessing in what way CS can benefit port competitiveness. The framework is built on a systematic literature analysis of the past years. The literature analysis exceeds previous comparable contributions by its analytical detail and provides valuable new insights on sustainability in the maritime domain. The research indicates that the accurate measurement of CS initiatives in the port sector is urgent and meaningful. When appropriately measured, the value that CS can deliver to port users becomes apparent. This is, however, often created indirectly via branding, risk mitigation, etc. The paper contributes to academic knowledge as it is the first to develop a rigorous CS measurement framework usable for ports in terms of value.","[Stein, Michael; Acciaro, Michele] Kuhne Logist Univ, Hapag Lloyd Ctr Shipping & Global Logist CSGL, Grosser Grasbrook 17, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany",Kuhne Logistics University,"Stein, M (corresponding author), Kuhne Logist Univ, Hapag Lloyd Ctr Shipping & Global Logist CSGL, Grosser Grasbrook 17, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany.",michael.stein@the-klu.org; michele.acciaro@the-klu.org,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project [895-2017-1003],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project,This research has been supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project (No 895-2017-1003): Green Shipping: Governance and Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain.

Sixty-five elements are considered critical and/or strategic by Australia, Canada, India, Japan, Korea, the European Union, the UK and the USA, owing to concerns about supply-chain vulnerability. Critical minerals are not a new concept, nor is the current background of geopolitical tension and rivalry. What is different is the enormous, forecasted demand for critical minerals needed for low-carbon technologies, and the urgency of bringing new production online to meet net zero objectives by 2050 through the development of new supply and the diversification of critical mineral supply chains. Here, we review Australia's unique endowment of critical minerals and strategic materials, opportunities for development and their global significance. Australia has an enormous critical minerals endowment with documented resources of 26 of the 31 commodities on Australia's Critical Minerals List in 477 deposits, of which 75% remain undeveloped. In addition, there is potential for new discoveries and realisation of by-product opportunities in all Australian states and the Northern Territory. Government geoscience coupled with an entrepreneurial minerals sector has played, and will continue to play, an indispensable role in growing Australia's resources base and growing downstream value through processing innovation. To maximise equitable benefits and sustainable growth from critical mineral opportunities in Australia, continued improvement in environmental, social and governance performance is required, including partnerships with First Nations people, development of critical minerals standards, improved mineral traceability and growth of the circular economy. Mine waste reprocessing and by-product potential at existing mining operations provide tractable short- to medium-term opportunities to expand Australia's critical minerals mining, processing and manufacturing sectors, to counter some of the geopolitical leverage of dominant market players.","[Britt, A.

Path planning technology is one of the key technologies to achieve intelligent mobile robots. In order to improve the pickup efficiency and to reduce the resource waste and carbon emissions in logistics, we investigate the robot path optimization problem. Under the guidance of the sustainable development theory, we aim to achieve the goal of environmental social governance by shortening and smoothing robot paths. To improve the robot's ability to avoid dynamic obstacles and to quickly solve shorter and smoother robot paths, we propose a fusion algorithm based on the improved genetic algorithm and the dynamic window approach. By doing so, we can improve the efficiency of warehouse operations and reduce logistics costs, whilst also contributing to the realization of a green supply chain. In this paper, we implement an improved fusion algorithm for mobile robot path planning and illustrate the superiority of our algorithm through comparative experiments.

Methodologically, this research develops a systematic literature review based on papers published in the Web of Science database in the last ten years. As a result, there was an upward evolution of research on the searched topic, with one hundred fifteen publications in the last three years compared to one hundred six documents published in the previous seven years. It is also observed that studies published at the beginning of the time frame between 2011 and 2020 were more concerned with the adoption of corporate sustainability, while the most recent research focuses on new approaches and methodologies for its implementation. And, with regard to its implementation, one of the main barriers is the incorrect perception of senior managers that the results from corporate sustainability must be more linked to the economic than to the environmental and social spheres. As relevant aspects, this study observed that new technologies, currently led by the 5th generation mobile network (5G) and Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), can contribute to the insertion of corporate sustainability in the industrial context. It also noted that, despite being recent, COVID-19 was considered by several researchers as an event to be considered in terms of corporate sustainability.","[de Oliveira, Ualison Rebula; Menezes, Rodolfo Pombo] Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, 783 Desembargador Ellis Hermydio Figueira St Volta, BR-27213145 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fernandes, Vicente Aprigliano] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Av Brasil 2241, Valparaiso 2362807, Chile",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"de Oliveira, UR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense UFF, 783 Desembargador Ellis Hermydio Figueira St Volta, BR-27213145 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",ualison.oliveira@gmail.com; rodolfopombo@id.uff.br; vicente.aprigliano@pucv.cl,,,,,,,175,27,28,10,79,,,,1387-585X,1573-2975,,,,FEB,2024,26,2,,,,,3045,3079,,10.1007/s10668-023-02933-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-02933-7,,JAN 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Procurement by the defense sector includes purchases made through contracts to private businesses that manufacture durable goods. Manufacturing of these goods results in pollution production with toxic wastes being among the most dangerous pollutants for public health. Despite green purchasing policy goals, most transactions in the United States through defense contracts result in disproportionately high-toxic pollution releases by manufacturers. We find that persistent exemptions granted defense agencies from following green purchasing policy result in a landscape where contractor environmental performance is unchanging with defense contractors persistently polluting in high amounts. Further, we find that defense contractors are linked to most toxic releases from procurement meaning that exemptions may be hindering potential advancements from green purchasing policy. Results can inform the design of new guidance about procurement and expand understanding of environmental inequality.","[Hill, Dustin T.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Grad Program Environm Sci, Ctr Environm Med & Informat, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Hill, Dustin T.] Syracuse Univ, Falk Coll Sport & Human Dynam, Syracuse, NY USA; [Collins, Mary B.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Studies, Environm Hlth Program, Div Environm Sci,Ctr Environm Med & Informat, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Syracuse University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry,"Hill, DT (corresponding author), SUNY ESF, 209 Baker Lab,1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",dthill@syr.edu,,,"SUNY Discovery Challenge; Environmental Studies Department, SUNY ESF; Graduate Program in Environmental Science, SUNY ESF; National Science Foundation [1534976]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1534976] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1534976] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","SUNY Discovery Challenge; Environmental Studies Department, SUNY ESF; Graduate Program in Environmental Science, SUNY ESF; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","A version of this paper was presented at the Seventh Annual Duck Family Graduate Workshop on Environmental Politics and Governance and the authors thank the University of Washington for hosting the event and for the valuable participant feedback on the draft of this paper.

This study estimated the total annual cost of regulatory compliance and lost revenue for US aquaculture. The total annual regulatory cost was $196 million (in 2023 USD), which accounted for 9%-30% of total annual costs, one of the top five costs of aquaculture production. Regulatory costs result in disproportionately greater per-unit costs of production on smaller-scale farms. Total annual lost revenue was $807 million (36% of total sales value), which resulted from lost sales and thwarted expansion opportunities from regulatory actions that either closed access to existing markets, forced reduced scales of production, or prevented attempts to expand production to meet existing demand for the farm's products. Accounting for multiplier effects, lost economic contributions were $1.4 billion annually, with >8000 jobs lost nationally from farms alone, not including associated supply chain partners. Well-designed regulations made use of best available science, participatory approaches to rule-making, sunset clauses for removal of outdated regulations, and market-based approaches. Pathways identified to improve regulatory efficiency included: (1) sunset clauses for each rule; (2) reward incentives (i.e., reduced testing frequency for farms with records of compliance) (3) standardized fish health testing requirements of sample size, farm-wide rather than lot testing, testing the most susceptible species/life stages; (4) non-lethal, multi-pathogen testing methods; (5) farm compensation for reverse externalities of avian predation; (6) appropriate risk management by experts to manage aquatic invasive species and pathogens; (7) training in aquaculture science, current farm practices, and appropriate, consistent, regulatory actions; (8) engagement with independent experts and producers throughout rule-making; (9) establishment of transparent appeals processes for farmers; (10) concurrent, not sequential review of permit requests by agencies; (11) long-term aquaculture literacy programs; and (12) an efficient, streamlined permitting and regulatory framework for mariculture.","[Engle, Carole R.] Engle Stone Aquat LLC, Strasburg, VA 22657 USA; [van Senten, Jonathan; Clark, Charles] Virginia Tech Univ, VA Seafood AREC, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Hegde, Shraddha] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [Kumar, Ganesh] Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS USA; [Boldt, Noah] ESC INC, Arlington, VA USA; [Fornshell, Gary] Univ Idaho Extens, Aquaculture Results LLC, Moscow, ID USA; [Hudson, Bobbi] Pacific Shellfish Inst, Olympia, WA USA; [Cassiano, Eric J.; Dimaggio, Matthew A.] Univ Florida, Trop Aquaculture Lab, Moscow, ID USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mississippi State University; University of Idaho; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Engle, CR (corresponding author), Engle Stone Aquat LLC, Strasburg, VA 22657 USA.",caroleengle2015@gmail.com,,,Economic Research Service [58-6000-2-0122]; USDA-Economics Research Service; Virginia Tech University,Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA-Economics Research Service; Virginia Tech University,Funding was provided by the USDA-Economics Research Service through Cooperative Agreement Number 58-6000-2-0122 to Virginia Tech University.

Most responsible fisheries initiatives are market driven and motivate transitions towards greener economies. These added-value fish economies have increasingly connected fishing grounds to external markets that demand high quality sustainable products. This article problematizes the framework of responsible fishing and examines its intersections with place-base institutional processes in the Pacific coast of Colombia. In doing this, it explores how the concept of 'responsible fishing' has been framed, arguing that it has been used to operationalize the expansion of neoliberal processes in the oceans. It draws on small-scale fisheries performed by Afro-descendant people in the Gulf of Tribuga, where responsible fishing narratives have been linked to the creation of marine protected areas and responsible fish supply chains. Two dominant framings of responsible fishing were identified; a 'sustainability' framing that denotes the sustainable use of fishing resources, and a 'technical' framing that refers to the use of environmentally safe practices. However, none of these framings accounts for social responsibility. Instead they have enforced the division of fishing practices between 'responsible'/'irresponsible', and produced static, ahistorical and oversimplified understandings of fishing dynamics. All this has triggered a local need for external control over fisheries governance, disempowering place-based control mechanisms. This article concludes by questioning whether responsible fishing can successfully ensure a sustainable use of fishing resources, or if moving beyond `responsibility' is needed to strengthen local institutional processes and autonomy among coastal peoples.","[Satizabal, Paula] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Satizábal, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",paula.satizabal@gmail.com,,,Francisco Jose de Caldas Scholarship from Colciencias; Albert Shimmins Postgraduate Writing-Up Award; School of Geography from the University of Melbourne,Francisco Jose de Caldas Scholarship from Colciencias; Albert Shimmins Postgraduate Writing-Up Award; School of Geography from the University of Melbourne,"The author would like to thank the coastal communities along the Gulf of Tribuga, the Los Riscales Community Council, and the Gulf of Tribuga Environmental Ordinance Roundtable whose support in the development of this research was invaluable.

The pandemic has provided an opportunity for commerce to move on to being more authentic, to offer genuine CSR applications and to contribute toward dealing with pressing environmental and social issues. Hence, this purpose of the research is to obtain a better understanding of whether the integration of environment, social, corporate governance and economic (ESGE) aspects into CSR strategies can support sustainable development toward more sustainable growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. To meet this challenge, we offer a mixture multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) model. Very few empirical studies have discussed CSR in the high-tech industry and proposed strategies and planning for ESGE efficiency. Using interviews with experts and a literature review, we identify the elements related to actual practices of the high-tech industry's appraisal and the integrated MCDM techniques to suggest efficient enhancement models. The best worst method (BWM) and modified VIKOR are implemented to estimate the strategic weights and the gaps of the aspiration value.

Bangladesh has attained 99% sanitation coverage, mostly with onsite sanitation systems; however, the country is facing a second-generation sanitation challenge, fecal sludge management, encompassing the entire sanitation chain. Kushtia Municipality in Bangladesh is entirely served by onsite systems; the fecal sludge emptying service is provided by the municipality, and the fecal sludge treatment plant is managed by a private entity. This study investigated sustainability of FFMs in Kushtia by using the financial, institutional, environmental, technical, and social (FIETS) sustainability approach and applying the financial flow simulator (eSOSView (TM)) tool to analyze financial viability. Several criteria in each aspect of the FIETS approach were developed, scored, and validated by stakeholders to determine sustainability. The study found that the financial aspect is the most important criteria for sustainability and modified parallel tax and discharge fee is the most sustainable business model for Kushtia.","[Akbar Chinna Mohideen, Sheik Mohammed Shibl; Brdjanovic, Damir] Adm Staff Coll India, Ctr Environm Urban Governance & Infrastruct Dev, Hyderabad, India; [Akbar Chinna Mohideen, Sheik Mohammed Shibl; Singh, Shirish] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Supply Sanitat & Environm Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Chowdhury, Tanvir Ahamed] SNV Netherlands Dev Org, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Brdjanovic, Damir] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Delft, Netherlands",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Delft University of Technology,"Mohideen, SMSAC (corresponding author), Adm Staff Coll India, Ctr Environm Urban Governance & Infrastruct Dev, Hyderabad, India.;Mohideen, SMSAC; Singh, S (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Supply Sanitat & Environm Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",shiblakbar@gmail.com; s.singh@un-ihe.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1157500]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1157500] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),The study was a part of MSc research supported by the Accelerating the Impact of Education and Training of Non-Sewered Sanitation project financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1157500).,,31,2,2,0,11,,,,,2296-665X,,,,JUN 1,2022,10,,,,,,,,863044,10.3389/fenvs.2022.863044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.863044,,,,Environmental Sciences,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This decline reflects unequal policy support for grasslands and managed grazing compared to row crops. To create a resource for community partners and decision-makers, we reviewed and analyzed the policy tools and implementation capacity that supports and constrains grasslands and managed grazing in the U.S. Upper Midwest. Risk reduction subsidies for corn and soybeans far outpace the support for pasture. Some states lost their statewide grazing specialist when the federal Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative lapsed. The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service support for lands with prescribed grazing practices declined after 2005 but remained relatively steady 2010-2020. These results reveal the policy disadvantage for grasslands and managed grazing in comparison with row crop agriculture for milk and meat production. Grassland and grazing policies have an important nexus with water quality, biodiversity, carbon and outdoor recreation policy. Socially just transitions to well-managed, grazed grasslands require equity-oriented interventions that support community needs. We synthesized recommendations for national and state policy that farmers and other grazing professionals assert would support perennial grasslands and grazing, including changes in insurance, conservation programs, supply chains, land access, and fair labor. These policies would provide critical support for grass-based agriculture and prairies that we hope will help build soil, retain nutrients, reduce flooding and enhance biodiversity while providing healthy food, jobs, and communities.","[Rissman, Adena R.; Lowe, Erin B.; Lu, Yu] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Fochesatto, Ana] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI USA; [Hirsch, Regina M.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Ctr Integrated Agr Syst, Madison, WI USA; [Jackson, Randall D.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agron, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Rissman, AR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",adena.rissman@wisc.edu,,,,,,,132,3,5,11,42,,,,,2571-581X,,,,MAR 3,2023,7,,,,,,,,1010441,10.3389/fsufs.2023.1010441,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1010441,,,,Food Science & Technology,,Food Science & Technology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transportation emissions are rapidly increasing in developing countries and are the second greatest source of emissions after electricity generation globally. Reducing freight transportation emissions is not a priority on the corporate sustainability agenda for many companies despite their significant impact on climate change. This research explores the paradox between the significant negative impact of freight transportation on climate change and its lack of saliency in corporate strategy using data from in-depth interviews with 12 organizations that are shipper members of SmartWay, a voluntary environmental partnership (VEP). Using mid-range theory (MRT) building beginning with legitimacy theory, this research explores how transportation functions and corporations measure and report freight transportation emissions reduction as part of the environmental sustainability agenda. The results provide insight into how an operationally focused VEP is challenged in gaining strategic organizational importance for its mission of freight emissions reduction and why the current approach of focusing on freight emission issues in transportation has limited traction.","[Tate, Wendy L.; Saunders, Lance] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Ellram, Lisa M.] Miami Univ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Tate, WL (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",wendy.tate@utk.edu,,,,,,,92,1,1,2,7,,,,0041-1612,2157-328X,,,,SUM,2023,62,3,,,,,269,310,,10.5325/transportationj.62.3.0269,http://dx.doi.org/10.5325/transportationj.62.3.0269,,,,Management; Transportation,,Business & Economics; Transportation,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Utilizing panel data spanning from 1999 to 2020 for 114 cities in the Yellow River Basin, this study develops a comprehensive evaluation framework for sustainable development, incorporating economic, social, and ecological dimensions. The empirical findings reveal that the digital economy acts as a catalyst for sustainable development. Importantly, these results withstand both endogeneity tests and robustness checks. Further heterogeneity analysis indicates that the positive impact of the digital economy on sustainable development is more pronounced in regions directly traversed by the Yellow River and in areas with higher sustainability levels. Moreover, the enactment and implementation of the 13th Five-Year National Information Plan have emphasized the role of the digital economy in enhancing sustainable development. Mechanism tests also illustrate those elevated levels of personal digital acceptance and government intervention contribution to amplify the digital economy's positive impact on sustainable development.

The analysis firstly focused on exploring sustainability disclosure and reporting practices, moving then to the examination of China-specific sustainability initiatives according to the Global Reporting Initiative(GRI) standards categories: Economic, environmental, and social. Adopting a theoretical perspective based on elements of institutional theory and stakeholder theory, we highlight how the development of sustainability reports by companies in the luxury sector is still a limited practice involving larger companies that have already invested in the implementation of sustainability strategies. The findings reveal how the reporting of China-specific sustainability initiatives is influenced by a set of factors such as company dimensions, company nationality, the management of the supply chain and operation in China, and the direct reference to China as a key market in terms of revenues. Finally, a cluster analysis shows how companies belonging to different relevant markets for the luxury sector demonstrate different homogeneous approaches by geographical area (isomorphism), with French and Chinese companies more engaged in reporting their sustainability initiatives in China.","[Galli, Davide; Bassanini, Federica] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci DiSES, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Galli, D (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci DiSES, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",davide.galli@unicatt.it; fbassanini23@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,13,13,7,52,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAY,2020,12,9,,,,,,,3940,10.3390/su12093940,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12093940,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objectives are to identify: (1) the latest research, development, and innovation activities; (2) issues and key barriers related to the technology readiness to bring biogas/biomethane to market; and (3) commercialisation issues, including cost parity with natural gas (the main competitor). A survey of the literature was carried out based on research articles and grey literature. The PESTEL and SWOT analyses identified opportunities for these fuels due to the relevant regulations (e.g., Fit for 55; the recent inclusion of the Mediterranean Sea as a SECA and PM control area; MPEC 79), market-based measures, and environmental, social, and governance strategies. The potential of biomass feedstock is estimated to have a substantial value that can satisfy the energy needs of the maritime industry. However, production costs of biomethane are high; estimated to be 2-4 times higher compared to natural gas. The market is moving in the direction of alternative drop-in fuels, including liquefied and compressed biomethane (LBM and CBM) and biogas. In terms of potential market penetration, LBM can be used as a marine drop-in fuel for the existing fleet that already combust LNG and LPG due to similar handling. Currently, these vessels are LNG and LPG tankers. However, in newly built vessels, LBM can be also supplied to container ships, vehicle carriers, and bulk carriers (about 20% of newly built vessels). Provided that compressed natural gas infrastructure exists, CBM can be exploited in vessels with low energy needs and low space requirements and shore-side electrification, because investments in retrofits are lower compared to constructing new infrastructure.","[Mallouppas, George; Yfantis, Elias Ar.; Ioannou, Constantina; Paradeisiotis, Andreas; Ktoris, Angelos] Cyprus Marine & Maritime Inst, Marine & Offshore Sci Technol & Engn Ctr, CY-6023 Larnax, Cyprus; [Yfantis, Elias Ar.] Univ Nicosia, Dept Engn, CY-2417 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Nicosia,"Mallouppas, G (corresponding author), Cyprus Marine & Maritime Inst, Marine & Offshore Sci Technol & Engn Ctr, CY-6023 Larnax, Cyprus.",george.mallouppas@cmmi.blue,,,Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) [ENTERPRISES/0521/0162],Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF)(Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF)),"The research is part of the BioCH4-to-Market project, which was funded by the Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) as part of the 'RESEARCH IN ENTERPRISES' programme, under grant agreement number ENTERPRISES/0521/0162.",,126,10,10,13,36,,,,,1996-1073,,,,FEB,2023,16,4,,,,,,,2066,10.3390/en16042066,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16042066,,,,Energy & Fuels,,Energy & Fuels,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A tripartite game model among the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) department, producers and the public is constructed based on the non-cooperative evolutionary game theory. Then this paper uses a system dynamics method to simulate and analyze the proposed game model. It is found that benefits of strict regulation strategy and financial subsidies subsidized by a superior EPB help to ease behavioral conflicts among game players, but their positive moderating impacts are scant. Effects of administrative fines and rectification due to the relaxed regulation strategy are unpredictable, such that the principle of moderation must be taken into account when rewarding or punishing an inferior EPB. As far as the producer is concerned, policy compensation paid by the EPB department has a positive effect on easing conflicts, but the impact of administrative penalties exerted on the producer who violates EPR system behind the scenes is negative. The profit-making characteristic of producers makes the influence of EPR system acceptance cost uncertain, which also implies that a suitable policy system is beneficial to changing producers' natural resistance to the EPR system. Noteworthy, effects of all the three factors on producers are lagging behind. Last but not least, under the premise of different environmental regulations, the public's expectations of environmental protection play exactly the opposite role. This study provides detailed and enlightening suggestions to different countries for constructing a comprehensive EPR policy system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This study contributes towards a better understanding of this tension by comparing two dimensions of relational ties and examining their contingent values given different environmental factors and exchange characteristics. Design/methodology/approach The authors used survey data from 194 matched buyer-supplier dyads in China's high-tech industries and employed hierarchical moderated regression analysis to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The authors find that compared with tie strength, tie brokerage has a stronger positive effect on co-exploration. Moreover, guanxi importance amplifies the effect of tie strength while decreasing the value of tie brokerage. As market uncertainty increases, the role of tie brokerage becomes more salient. Additionally, tie strength becomes less effective when buyer centralization is high, whereas tie brokerage exerts a stronger impact on co-exploration when an exchange is highly formalized. Originality/value This study contributes to the supply chain literature by adopting a relational perspective to integrate relational ties into the study of buyer-supplier co-exploration and by elaborating on the different implications of tie strength and tie brokerage in resolving the novelty-action trade-off.

Unlike other business sectors whose adverse impacts and RBC efforts (or lack thereof) are well documented, a comprehensive understanding of the state of commodity trading (CT), has been missing. In response, this paper uses a multidisciplinary literature review to provide an integrative understanding of the current state of research on the relationship between CT and RBC. Based on a review of 131 articles, we advance a granular understanding of the current and prospective role of commodity traders in RBC by grouping extant research into three overarching themes: (1) industry self-regulation and co-regulatory initiatives, (2) government-led regulatory initiatives and policy responses, and (3) company-level management strategies impacting RBC practices. In addition to illustrating the themes through existing research and identifying gaps along the overarching themes, we use our literature review to suggest avenues for future research. The paper's overarching contribution is, first, to synthesize previously fragmented findings into a coherent framework of CT and RBC. And second, to offer guidance on how scholarship in this important domain can be developed into a more mature, legitimate and practical stream of research.","[Dorfmueller, Henrietta; Kimotho, Wangui; Ebert, Isabel; Wettstein, Florian] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Dey, Pascal] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Bern, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Dorfmüller, H (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland.",henrietta.dorfmueller@unisg.ch; rose.kimotho@unisg.ch; isabel.ebert@unisg.ch; pascal.dey@bfh.ch; florian.wettstein@unisg.ch,,,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Frderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Frderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,No Statement Available,,175,0,0,11,19,,,,0167-4544,1573-0697,,,,DEC,2024,195,3,,,,,449,473,,10.1007/s10551-024-05635-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-024-05635-w,,MAR 2024,,Business; Ethics,,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The findings suggest that sustainability standards may impede small-scale farmers' participation in agribusiness. Specifically, the implementation of organic certification, essential for the functionality of the company business models, contributes most to small-scale farmer exclusion.

In this context, this work proposes a framework for holistically addressing these themes with tools (circularity indicators and technological resources) to assist organizations in the manufacturing sector that aim to adopt circular processes with a focus on the pillars of sustainability. To elaborate the framework, the SODA (Strategic Options Development and Analysis) method was applied to explore, with the help of the interviewed specialist, the complexities of the problem studied, enabling the identification of 7 important issues or dimensions on the path to circularity. To shape the framework, 7 experts were interviewed (one for each dimension) to validate and classify the circularity indicators (prospected in the literature and added by them), correlating them to the spheres of sustainability and digital transformation technologies. The results of the framework analysis showed that achieving circularity demands the consideration of the following factors: the circularity of energy aiming at its efficiency, circularity of inputs for better use of resources, investments in circularity for process optimization, establishment of new circular businesses taking advantage of the good experiences obtained, circular and non -circular supply chain integration, compliance and governance for circularity meeting the expectations of stakeholders and the relevance of feasibility studies to technical, economic and environmental to implement circularity of product components.","[Payer, Renan Carrico; Quelhas, Osvaldo Luiz Goncalves; Bergiante, Nissia Carvalho Rosa] Fluminense Fed Univ Brazil, Prod Engn, 156 Passo da Patria St, BR-24210240 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",,"Payer, RC (corresponding author), Fluminense Fed Univ Brazil, Prod Engn, 156 Passo da Patria St, BR-24210240 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",rpayer@id.uff.br; osvaldoquelhas@id.uff.br; nissiabergiante@id.uff.br,,,,,CNPq Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technologic Development and CAPES Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination.

To take into account the carbon footprint on crude oil from its international distribution segment, we utilize a micro-level dataset of more than 28,000 individual shipment samples to estimate each journey's carbon emissions. The unique detailed dataset enables us to aggregate carbon emissions at the country level for importers and exporters, by trade lane, and by vessel size categories. Our methodology provides a framework for crude oil consumers to dynamically account for the carbon footprint of the commodity which is transported via different trade routes and by different vessels (size and age). So far, this dynamic emissions accounting has been largely neglected by oil consumers who typically apply one single emission factor regardless its supply chain. Our results highlight the importance for importers to consider the origin and point-of-use of crude oil in order to have a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint. The quantitative analysis in this study can feed into well-to-tank fuel emissions factors for oil and oil products in order to adopt dynamic emissions factors in companies' carbon accounting.

We took a quantitative approach through an online survey to collect the required data from manufacturing companies in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data.

One example is the Volkswagen Emission Gate Scandal. Using firm-level panel data of major automobile manufacturers from 2000 to 2015, this study empirically identifies the motives behind the corporate deception scandal. We develop a conceptual model summarising the factors affecting decision-making, and the firms' environmentally responsible investments (ERIs) including the truthfulness of related public communications. Our findings identify legal and regulatory pressures, the firm's existing level of ERIs competency and expertise, pressures from emission regulation, market competitors, consumers, owners, or shareholders as the key factors inducing the scandal. The empirical findings show that firms are more likely to experience corporate fraud if their senior managers are paid with substantial variable components that may lead them to engage in riskier business behaviour and to be more short-term focused, thereby supporting the well-established contract theory. To avoid corporate fraud and engage in legitimate business competitiveness, we suggest that firms should focus on technological innovation as well as improving corporate governance and leverage ratios to effectively control and monitor management. In addition, policy makers should be more realistic about practical and commercial limitations in the policy-setting process, and take on a more supporting role in achieving technological innovations and effective corporate governance. In summary, we argue that cleaner production is not only the result of technologically progress and research, but importantly it also involves issues associated with corporate governance and business ethics.

However, producing chocolate comes with some sticky social, environmental and economic problems. This paper focuses on the issues of child labour, forced child labour and unsustainable farming practice within the chocolate industry, and specifically on the discourse about Nestle's Ivory Coast cocoa supply chain. We analyse corporate disclosures, related counter accounts and subsequent responses in new and old media as a dynamic communication process. A mobilising of Goffman's (1959) dramaturgical metaphor of impression management contextualises each communication as a performance towards an audience. Behind the communications is Nestle's need to repair its legitimacy - because child labour and unsustainable farming exist in its cocoa supply chain - and the audience's vested interests in their counter-performances. The Nestle case offers substantive and nuanced insights into corporate disclosure and communication practices, how the Internet is changing the more unidirectional performances of the past, and how appreciation of counter accounts and subsequent responses to counter accounts contributes to theoretical understanding as well as provides insights into the plight of cocoa's child labourers.

Specifically, there is a lack of a standardized decision analytics framework for ESG-oriented supplier relationship management (SRM) processes in the manufacturing sector. To address this gap, this study introduces a multi-criteria supplier analytics framework (MCSAF) towards sustainable SRM. Through referring traditional supplier evaluation criteria as well as emerging ESG criteria, a novel decision hierarchy for supplier segmentation is developed. The proposed system utilizes the Bayesian best-worst method and the Canopy-k-means clustering algorithm to formulate different supplier segments for strategic development. The proposed MCSAF has been successfully implemented in a German solar water pump manufacturer. The results show that the five highest-ranked criteria are 'Quality', 'Impact and importance on product quality and business growth', 'Environmental policy/management', 'Customer and product responsibility', and 'Risk and crisis management'. 52 suppliers are categorized into five segments, leading to the formulation of ESG-enabled supplier development strategies are subsequently formulated. The successful implementation of the MCSAF showcases its effectiveness in advancing ESG practices in sustainable supplier management.","[Li, Yanlin; Tsang, Y. P.; Lee, C. K.

The sustainable agriculture models-comprising organic farming, regenerative agriculture, climate-smart agriculture, carbon-capture agriculture, and nature-based solutions-focus primarily on improving ecological sustainability through farm-level practices. These models emphasize reducing external, industrial inputs, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting climate resilience, relying on technological and market-based solutions to address environmental concerns. On the other hand, the sustainable agrifood systems models-agroecology, alternative food networks, and permaculture-offer more ambitious visions of systemic transformation. These approaches not only seek to implement environmentally sound practices but also aim to reconfigure the broader food system by challenging corporate power, promoting local governance, fostering food sovereignty, and prioritizing social justice. Grounded in grassroots movements, these models emphasize social justice and economic viability in addition to ecological sustainability. This paper's contribution lies in its comparative analysis of the wide array of sustainable alternatives, highlighting both their strengths and limitations. Adopting an agrarian political economy perspective, it critiques the former camp for limited engagement with structural issues inherent in capitalist agriculture and the latter camp for underplaying the importance of industrial agriculture for national development in the Global South.","[Zhang, Qian Forrest] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore 179873, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Zhang, QF (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore 179873, Singapore.",forrestzhang@smu.edu.sg,,,Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2; [MOE-T2EP40221-0005],"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore);",This research was funded a grant from the Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 (Grant #: MOE-T2EP40221-0005).,,164,2,2,38,38,,,,,2071-1050,,,,NOV,2024,16,22,,,,,,,9675,10.3390/su16229675,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16229675,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model that introduces the prospect theory, and verifies numerical examples in combination with system dynamics simulation methods. Therefore, this study discusses the influence of evolutionary stability strategies on the development of electric ship industry. The results show that in order to realize effective governance of inland shipping pollution, the optimal evolutionary stability strategies of the three stakeholders should be as follows: active supervision in both upstream and downstream governments, and using clean energy in shipping companies. The improvement of the initial probability and risk preference of the three parties is conducive to promoting the faster and more stable industrial development, while reasonable profit distribution coefficient and compensation cost can promote the benign development of the inland river environmental governance system. In addition, the probability of upstream and downstream governments and shipping companies choosing the optimal strategies is positively related to the government fines, and negatively related to the regulatory costs. In particular, the application of prospect theory makes the result of evolutionary equilibrium more obvious.","[Xu, Lang; Di, Zhongjie] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jihong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Shenzhen University,"Chen, JH (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",xulang@shmtu.edu.cn; cxjh2004@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [20VHQ006],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (20VHQ006).,,63,119,122,45,294,,,,0025-326X,1879-3363,,,,OCT,2021,171,,,,,,,,112730,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112730,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112730,,JUL 2021,,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the challenges of counting and making commensurable the global warming impact of a myriad of biophysical and societal activities, this desire to communicate a product or service's carbon footprint has sparked complicated carbon calculative practices and enrolled actors at literally every node of multi-scaled and vastly complex global supply chains. Against this landscape, this paper critically analyzes the counting practices that create the 'e' in 'CO(2)e'. It is shown that, central to these practices are a series of tools, models and databases which, in building upon previous work (Eden, 2012; Star and Griesemer, 1989) we conceptualize here as 'boundary objects'. By enrolling everyday actors from farmers to consumers, these objects abstract and stabilize greenhouse gas emissions from their messy material and social contexts into units of CO(2)e which can then be translated along a product's supply chain, thereby establishing a new currency of 'everyday supply chain carbon'. However, in making all greenhouse gas-related practices commensurable and in enrolling and stabilizing the transfer of information between multiple actors these objects oversee a process of simplification reliant upon, and subject to, a multiplicity of approximations, assumptions, errors, discrepancies and/or omissions. Further the outcomes of these tools are subject to the politicized and commercial agendas of the worlds they attempt to link, with each boundary actor inscribing different meanings to a product's carbon footprint in accordance with their specific subjectivities, commercial desires and epistemic framings. It is therefore shown that how a boundary object transforms greenhouse gas emissions into units of CO(2)e, is the outcome of distinct ideologies regarding 'what' a product's carbon footprint is and how it should be made legible. These politicized decisions, in turn, inform specific reduction activities and ultimately advance distinct, specific and increasingly durable transition pathways to a low carbon society.

These solutions aim to establish formalized partnerships among ports, carriers, shippers, and countries. During the process, the stakeholders must consider four priority areas (alternative fuels, bunkering infrastructure, vessel decarbonization pathways, and cargo demand dynamics) from seven angles (environmental, economic, infrastructure, regulatory, operational, technological, and social). This study explores the prioritization of these criteria for establishing a green maritime corridor between two major ports in Portugal and Angola, which would be a significant step toward promoting sustainable global trade. Utilizing the fuzzy AHP, this research analyzes all these factors and their associated sub-criteria derived from a comprehensive literature review and consultations with stakeholders from the Ports of Sines and Luanda. The findings show the dominance of environmental compatibility and economic viability, while social acceptance shows the lowest score. This framework guides the decision-making process for developing a sustainable shipping corridor. The results offer valuable insights for policymakers which can guide them in fostering resilient maritime transport routes, accelerating the adoption of decarbonization strategies and playing a critical role in achieving the IMO's zero-emission targets by 2050.","[Bengue, Alberto Antonio; Alavi-Borazjani, Seyedeh Azadeh] Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Bengue, Alberto Antonio] Port Luanda, Luanda, Angola; [Alavi-Borazjani, Seyedeh Azadeh] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Chkoniya, Valentina] Univ Aveiro, Competitiveness & Publ Pol GOVCOPP & Aveiro, Res Unit Governance, Inst Accounting & Adm ISCA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Chkoniya, Valentina] Univ Coimbra, Civil Engn Dept, ISISE, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Cacho, Jose Luis] Port Sines, P-7521953 Sines, Portugal; [Fiore, Mariantonietta] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via Romolo Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Coimbra; University of Foggia,"Alavi-Borazjani, SA (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Environm & Planning, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Alavi-Borazjani, SA (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies CESAM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Fiore, M (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via Romolo Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",albertobengue@ua.pt; saab@ua.pt; valentina.chkoniya@ua.pt; luis.cacho@apsinesalgarve.pt; mariantonietta.fiore@unifg.it,,,"PRR-Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia; NextGenerationEU funds at University of Aveiro [C645112083-00000059, 53]",PRR-Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia; NextGenerationEU funds at University of Aveiro,"This research was funded by the PRR-Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia and by the NextGenerationEU funds at University of Aveiro, through the scope of the Agenda for Business Innovation NEXUS: Pacto de Inovacao-Transicao Verde e Digital para Transportes, Logistica e Mobilidade (Project no 53 with the application C645112083-00000059).",,68,4,4,29,29,,,,,2071-1050,,,,NOV,2024,16,21,,,,,,,9563,10.3390/su16219563,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16219563,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most research consists of single-case studies, only partly covers the different dimensions related to the implementation of sustainability reporting, or is based on content analysis. This paper offers a multidimensional approach of the concept of sustainability reporting based on a global survey yielding 97 complete and valid answers of PMBs. A binomial logistic regression has been conducted to identify those organizational characteristics, whether or not under the control of the PMB, that have the largest explanatory power when it comes to the adoption of the practice of sustainability reporting. The research results present new variables compared to the findings of previous studies, such as proximity to a city, the history of data gathering, and the presence of environmental/social certifications. Furthermore, this paper also investigates how these organizational characteristics are interlinked with external, contextual forces by making use of Institutional Theory. By combining organizational characteristics with information on the institutional environment in which the PMB operates, a more complete image is obtained. The results of this analysis show that myriad different institutional pressures are in play when it comes to having influence over the decision making of PMBs with regard to the adoption of sustainability reporting. Furthermore, several prominent associations between one of the isomorphisms and certain organizational characteristics can be observed.","[Geerts, Magali; Dooms, Michael] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Business, Res Unit Management & Strategy, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Stas, Lara] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Publ Hlth, Biostat & Med Informat Res Grp, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Geerts, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Business, Res Unit Management & Strategy, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",magali.geerts@vub.be; michael.dooms@vub.be; Lara.stas@vub.be,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of the Government of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of the Government of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The APC was funded by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of the Government of Canada: project title Green Shipping: Governance & Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain.,,70,24,26,2,26,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR,2021,13,6,,,,,,,3148,10.3390/su13063148,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13063148,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, despite ever-more detailed information on where deforestation occurs, how agriculture expands into forests remains unclear, which is hampered by a lack of spatially and temporally detailed reconstruction of agricultural expansion. Here, we developed and mapped a novel set of metrics that quantify agricultural frontier processes at unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. Specifically, we first derived consistent annual time series of land-use/cover to, second, describe archetypical patterns of frontier expansion, pertaining to the speed, the diffusion and activity of deforestation, as well as post-deforestation land use. We exemplify this approach for understanding agricultural frontier expansion across the entire South American Chaco (1.1 million km(2)), a global deforestation hotspot. Our study provides three major insights. First, agricultural expansion has been rampant in the Chaco, with more than 19.3 million ha of woodlands converted between 1985 and 2020, including a surge in deforestation after 2019. Second, land-use trajectories connected to frontier processes have changed in major ways over the 35 year study period we studied, including substantial regional variations. For instance, while ranching expansion drove most of the deforestation in the 1980s and 1990s, cropland expansion dominated during the mid-2000s in Argentina, but not in Paraguay. Similarly, 40% of all areas deforested were initially used for ranching, but later on converted to cropping. Accounting for post-deforestation land-use change is thus needed to properly attribute deforestation and associated environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions or biodiversity loss, to commodities. Finally, we identified major, recurrent frontier types that may be a useful spatial template for land governance to match policies to specific frontier situations. Collectively, our study reveals the diversity of frontier processes and how frontier metrics can capture and structure this diversity to uncover major patterns of human-nature interactions, which can be used to guide spatially-targeted policies.","[Baumann, Matthias; Buchadas, Ana; Oeser, Julian; Romero-Munoz, Alfredo; Mueller, Daniel; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Gasparri, Ignacio] Univ Nacl Tucuman UNT, Inst Ecol Reg IER, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, CC 34, RA-4107 Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina; [Gasparri, Ignacio] Univ Nacl Tucuman UNT, Fac Ciencias Nat, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Gasparri, Ignacio] Univ Nacl Tucuman UNT, Inst Miguel Lillo, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Meyfroidt, Patrick] XX Fonds Rech Sci FRS FNRS, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Levers, Christian] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Dept Environm Geog, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Inst Study Int Dev, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mueller, Daniel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Economies IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Buchadas, Ana; Mueller, Daniel; Kuemmerle, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Miguel Lillo Foundation; Universite Catholique Louvain; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; McGill University; McGill University; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Baumann, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",matthias.baumann@hu-berlin.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [KUJ 2458/5-1]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF) [031B0034A]; Belgian Science Policy Office Research Program for Earth Observation [SR/00/338]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [101001239]; European Research Council (ERC) [101001239] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Belgian Science Policy Office Research Program for Earth Observation; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We gratefully acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Project KUJ 2458/5-1), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF, Project PASANOA, 031B0034A), and the Belgian Science Policy Office Research Program for Earth Observation (belspo-STEREO-III, Project REFORCHA, SR/00/338).

Most of the methodologies developed so far measure resource efficiency on the basis of the environmental burden of the resource relative to the value of output. However, the key point of circular economy is keeping resources within the economy when products no longer serve their functions so that materials can be used again and therefore generate more value. The unit in which resource efficiency and circular economy are measured greatly affects both the ease of acceptance by policymakers and the direction in which green policy will change our society. Whereas the most common approaches to assessing resource efficiency and circular economy use mass, in this paper we advocate measuring both resource efficiency and circular economy in terms of the market value of 'stressed' resources, since this value incorporates the elements of scarcity versus competition as well as taxes representing urgent social and environmental externalities. The market value of resources is well-documented and responds automatically to the locality and time at which resources are used. Applying this unit, circularity is defined as the percentage of the value of stressed resources incorporated in a service or product that is returned after its end-of-life. Resource efficiency is the ratio of added product value divided by the value of stressed resources used in production or a process thereof. It is argued that precisely the concept of a free market, in which materials, parts and components are exchanged purely on the basis of their functionality and cost, allows the resource efficiency of a process (KPI for industry and governance) to be distinguished from the resource efficiency of a product (KPI for consumers and governance). Using standard industry data from Statistics Netherlands, the resource efficiency of several Dutch industries were evaluated using the new methodology and compared with a traditional mass-based approach.

The nexus between digitalization and sustainability unfolds exciting opportunities in addressing global challenges, creating a just and sustainable society and laying the groundwork for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Several studies have reviewed the link between these two paradigms and how they mutually impact one another. However, most of these reviews are qualitative and manual literature reviews that are prone to subjectivity and so lacking the required rigor. Given the above, this study aims to provide a comprehensive and objective review of the knowledge base on how digitalization and sustainability actually and potentially contribute to each other and highlight the key research that links these two megatrends. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature is conducted to objectively visualize the research status quo across time, disciplines, and countries. The Web of Science (WOS) database was searched for relevant publications published between January 1, 1900, and October 31, 2021. The search returned 8629 publications, of which 3405 were identified as primary documents pertaining to the study presented below. The Scientometrics analysis identified prominent authors, nations, organizations, prevalent research issues and examined how they have evolved chronologically. The critical review of results reveals four main domains in research on the nexus of sustainability and digitalization including Governance, Energy, Innovation, and Systems. The concept of Governance is developed within the Planning and Policy-making themes. Energy relates to the themes of emission, consumption, and production. Innovation has associated with the themes of business, strategy, and values & environment. Finally, systems interconnect with networks, industry 4.0, and the supply chain. The findings are intended to inform and stimulate more research and policy-making debate on the potential interconnection between sustainability and digitization, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era.","[Irajifar, Leila] RMIT Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Design, Melbourne, Australia; [Chen, Hengcai; Cheshmehzangi, Ali] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Lak, Azadeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Tehran, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Network Educ & Res Peace & Sustainabil NERPS, Hiroshima, Japan; [Sharifi, Ayyoob; Cheshmehzangi, Ali] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Higashihiroshima, Japan",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Shahid Beheshti University; Hiroshima University; Hiroshima University,"Irajifar, L (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Design, Melbourne, Australia.",leila.irajifar@rmit.edu.au,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71950410760]; Network for Education; Hiroshima, Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) , Japan Government; Network for Education and Research on Peace and Sustainability (NERPS) , Hiroshima, Japan","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Network for Education; Hiroshima, Japan; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) , Japan Government; Network for Education and Research on Peace and Sustainability (NERPS) , Hiroshima, Japan","The authors declare the following conflict of interests: Ali Cheshmehzangi reports financial support was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) , and the Network for Education and Research on Peace and.

To this end, the study uses hand-coding and novel text-as-data techniques for content analysis of a large sample of 880 codes of conduct. Results show that a standardized list of labor rights is included in up to 90% of the aforementioned codes, regardless of the location or sector of the drafting company. Codes are drafted with a clear influence from internationally recognized standards, even though a minority of codes directly refer to international texts. However, the similarity of codes is limited as they differ in length and extent to which they elaborate certain topics. This latter aspect is correlated with the firms' location and the sector they operate in. The research demonstrates that European companies refer to the legal framework and international standards extensively, while American companies more often develop their corporate ethical values or focus on governance and their relationship with suppliers. It also empirically shows that companies evolving in reputation-sensitive sectors are developing more specific codes including more detailed labor provisions.","[Vandenbroucke, Sarah] Leiden Univ, Dept Business Studies, Rapenburg 70, NL-2311 EZ Leiden, Netherlands; [Kantorowicz, Jaroslaw] Leiden Univ, Inst Secur & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands; [Erkens, Yvonne] Leiden Univ, Dept Labour Law, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Vandenbroucke, S (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Dept Business Studies, Rapenburg 70, NL-2311 EZ Leiden, Netherlands.",s.e.m.vandenbroucke@law.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,41,2,2,5,10,,,,1535-3958,1535-3966,,,,JAN,2024,31,1,,,,,472,492,,10.1002/csr.2580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.2580,,AUG 2023,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Battery recycling research is beneficial not only for controlling toxic and harmful substances, but also for public health. In addition, battery recycling brings value-added benefits to company management. As the most important link in the battery supply chain, the driving mechanism of battery recycling in the new electric vehicle industry will become particularly important. The subject of battery recycling is diverse, and the relationships among influencing factors are complex, thereby presenting a fluctuating state. Against this background, this study constructs a system dynamics model from the perspective of a main sorting and recycling system, a technological innovation subsystem and a replacement subsystem. Moreover, this study examines the driving mechanism of the power battery recycling system of a microlevel company. Focusing on the systematic impact of technological innovation capability and substitution, we find that the technological innovation drive of companies increases the total effect of required costs and product demands. It is embodied in two aspects, that is, the increase in the recovery rate leads to an increase in demand, whereas the increase in actual expenditures is less than the increase in technology-driven benefits. After technological innovation capability is improved, the effect of the technological innovation multiplier on the driving mechanism of companies is shown as rapid response time changes. In the substitution component of a company recycling system, we find that the maximum substitution rate limiting expectations has no significant impact on product differentiation. The leading effect of technological innovation capability is more obvious than that of substitution activity.

But clean energy industries are part of global value chains (GVCs), where past manufacturing shifts from developed to emerging economies have raised questions on a decline in long-term innovation. Our research centers on how geographic shifts in the GVC shape long-term innovation, i.e., innovation in a time frame within which mission-oriented, societal, or firm strategic objectives need to be met rather than tactical, near-term market competitiveness alone. Focusing on wind energy, we introduce a temporal measure to distinguish between long-term and short-term innovation, applying natural language processing methods on patent text data. We consider supply-side value chain factors (i.e., manufacturing supplier relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)) and demand-side factors (i.e., policy-induced clean energy market growth), shaping the patenting activities of 358 global specialized wind suppliers (2006-2016). Our findings suggest that the wind industry did not suppress long-term innovation during manufacturing shifts, in this case to China. After 2012 when China developed a large wind market, long-term innovation increased by 80.7% in European suppliers working with non-European OEMs (including Chinese) and by 67.2% in Chinese suppliers working with non-Chinese OEMs. Our results highlight the importance of coupling international manufacturing relationships with sizeable local demand for inducing long-term innovation. Our results advance research in innovation, GVCs, and green industrial policy with implications for several industries that can contribute to climate mitigation.","[Doblinger, Claudia] Tech Univ Munich, Campus Straubing Biotechnol & Sustainabil, Straubing, Germany; [Doblinger, Claudia] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Straubing, Germany; [Surana, Kavita; Hultman, Nathan] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Global Sustainabil, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Surana, Kavita] Complex Sci Hub, Vienna, Austria; [Li, Deyu; Anadon, Laura Diaz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Ctr Environm Energy & Nat Resource Governance, Cambridge, England; [Li, Deyu] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Anadon, Laura Diaz] Harvard Univ, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Cambridge; Utrecht University; Harvard University,"Surana, K (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Global Sustainabil, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Surana, K (corresponding author), Complex Sci Hub, Vienna, Austria.",ksurana@umd.edu,,,ESRC [ES/S010688/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,121,18,19,52,139,,,,0048-7333,1873-7625,,,,SEP,2022,51,7,,,,,,,104558,10.1016/j.respol.2022.104558,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2022.104558,,,,Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate the relationship between trade and freshwater fishes, we developed a river-basin economic transaction model that is applied to mainland China, home to 9% of the world's freshwater fish species. Here, we show that interbasin trade induced by final demand contributes 74% of the threats to China's freshwater fish biodiversity. Economically developed river basins (e.g., the Huaihe River) are the main beneficiaries of interbasin trade at the cost of biodiversity deterioration in economically underdeveloped river basins (e.g., the upper Pearl River), especially when trade occurs between distant basins. Our findings highlight the significance of the shift in governance from administrative divisions to river basins and control measures in different stages of economic supply chains to mitigate freshwater fish biodiversity threats.","[Wang, Changbo; Wang, Qunwei; Zhou, Dequn; Zha, Donglan] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Wang, Changbo; Wang, Qunwei; Zhou, Dequn; Zha, Donglan] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Res Ctr Soft Energy Sci, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Wang, Changbo; Wang, Qunwei; Zhou, Dequn; Zha, Donglan] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Lab Digital Intelligence Management & Low Carbon O, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, E.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yafei] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Natl Accounts, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chang, Yuan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pengpeng] Hebei Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shijiazhuang 050024, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiao] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Pang, Mingyue] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Yu, Han] Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Nat Geog Resources & Environm, Lanzhou 730101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lixiao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat Pollut Contr, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lenzen, Manfred; Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, ISA, Sch Phys A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Zhang, Xuejun] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Feng, Meili] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Geog Sci, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Mi, Zhifu] UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 7HB, England","Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Hebei Normal University; Anhui Agricultural University; Chongqing University; Lanzhou University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University; University of Sydney; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of London; University College London","Wang, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.;Wang, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Res Ctr Soft Energy Sci, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.;Wang, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Lab Digital Intelligence Management & Low Carbon O, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, LX (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat Pollut Contr, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Mi, ZF (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London WC1E 7HB, England.",wqw0305@126.com; zhanglixiao@bnu.edu.cn; z.mi@ucl.ac.uk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [52225902, 72373064, 72161147003, 31572234]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education [22YJCZH184]; Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province [2022SJZD050]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education; Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province,"We are grateful for financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 52225902, 72373064, 72161147003, and 31572234) , the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education (grant no. 22YJCZH184) , and the Major Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province (grant no. 2022SJZD050) .",,50,0,0,15,15,,,,,2589-0042,,,,NOV 15,2024,27,11,,,,,,,111121,10.1016/j.isci.2024.111121,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.111121,,OCT 2024,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,Green Published,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has led to different strategies by communities, governments, and businesses involved in food systems to mitigate and adapt to the unfolding pandemic. Small Island Developing States are particularly exposed to the conflation of risks from COVID-19 disease, economic downturns, underlying climate vulnerabilities and biosecurity risks. Objective: Our study aimed to identify the food systems vulnerabilities, impacts, and opportunities for supporting resilience and sustainable development in selected Pacific Island countries, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. The study focused on the impacts from the first six months of the pandemic (February-July 2020), with remote data collection and analysis done between May and July 2020. Methods: We conducted 67 interviews, and triangulated information with desktop and news sources emerging at the time. We present results on the effect on smallholder livelihoods, supply chains, governance, communities and employment. Overall, the major impacts of COVID-19 have been on economies, posing risks to future food security and further hampering progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals. Results and conclusions: We found that unemployment and economic contraction have been the most severe effects to date, with long-term consequences for food value chains and smallholder farmers. Disruptions to tourism, labour migration, and remittances have led to varying socio-economic impacts throughout the region. Vulnerable groups, notably women, urban poor, and youth, have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. TimorLeste has had some social protection measures, whereas in Pacific Countries these have been varied. The lockdowns and State of Emergency initially influenced the distribution and marketing of food, but local food economies are starting to stabilise. The continued functioning of international food supply chains reduced the risk of food insecurity in high import dependent nations, notably import dependent countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati. Significance: The results have significance for three recovery pathways. The first recovery pathway relates to revisiting value chains in light of restricted travel. The second recovery pathway exists through leveraging the adaptive capacities of communities to stimulate innovative agriculture that also integrates climate adaptation and nutrition. The third recovery pathway relates to addressing the structural challenges that perpetuate inequalities and poverty while finding new ways of implementing inclusive policies and research.

The results provide evidence that institutional ownership is positively associated with ESG scores, particularly from firms listed in the U.S. suggesting these investors' consciousness in ESG investments in shipping stocks. Conversely, family ownership is negatively related to ESG ratings, while public ownership is more financially performance-driven, but not ESG-conscious. Additionally, firms with larger market capitalization tend to achieve higher ESG scores. However, this study finds no statistically significant relation between sustainability and financial performance.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the sustainability trade-offs and synergies associated with a range of agroforestry systems in Europe and assess the underlying reasons for different performance regarding environmental, economic, social and governance domains. METHODS: Five case-studies of agroforestry from nothern, eastern and southern Europe were assessed using an established sustainability assessment tool, the Public Goods tool (PG tool). The case studies were selected to represent a range of innovative and traditional systems, encompassing arable and livestock, wood fuel and tree fruit crops. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All five of the case studies were performing well across a diverse range of sus- tainability criteria, with average scores of three out of five or higher across the assessment categories. Social capital and animal health and welfare management scores were particularly high, due to high rates of on-farm employment of between 0.4 and 2.3 full-time labour units per hectare, and a high volume of local sales alongside effective health planning and husbandry through health planning and a lack of restrictions on natural behaviour. Land Equivalent Ratios were greater than 1 within each case and were particularly high for established silvo- pasture systems (over 1.5). Fossil fuel use was considerably lower than the industry average in most of the case studies (between 17 and 92% of the country-average per hectare for three of the cases). Economic performance was highly variable, with high labour costs contributing to negative margins. SIGNIFICANCE: The assessments show that agroforestry systems have considerable potential to contribute to multiple sustainability objectives, and that environmental and social sustainability objectives are particularly well addressed through increased efficiency of land-use, increased opportunities for on-farm employment and engagement with local communities. However considerable financial barriers still exist and may prevent its further uptake. Promoting the future uptake of agroforestry in Europe therefore requires the commitment of multiple actors in supply chains to plan policies, farm-practices and knowledge exchange that can support the delivery of sustainability benefits.","[Smith, Laurence G.; Westaway, Sally; Mullender, Samantha; Smith, Jo] Organ Res Ctr, Stroud Rd, Cirencester, England; [Smith, Laurence G.] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England; [Smith, Laurence G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Biosyst & Technol, Box 190, S-23422 Lomma, Sweden; [Ghaley, Bhim Bahadur; Xu, Ying] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lehmann, Lisa Molgaard] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Pisanelli, Andrea; Russo, Giuseppe] CNR, Inst Res Terr Ecosyst, Rome, Italy; [Borek, Robert; Wawer, Rafal; Borzecka, Magdalena] State Res Inst, Inst Soil Sci & Plant Cultivat, Pulawy, Poland; [Sandor, Mignon; Gliga, Adrian] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Smith, Jo] MV Agroecol Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Reading; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Institute of Soil Science & Plant Cultivation; University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,"Smith, LG (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Reading, Berks, England.",l.g.smith@reading.ac.uk,,,UK by DEFRA as part of the European FACCE SURPLUS ERA-NET cofund programme; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [652615]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [652615] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,UK by DEFRA as part of the European FACCE SURPLUS ERA-NET cofund programme; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"SustainFARM was a three-year project from 2016 to 2018, funded in the UK by DEFRA as part of the European FACCE SURPLUS ERA-NET cofund programme, formed in collaboration between the European Commission and a partnership of 15 countries in the frame of the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI).

J,"Warshawsky, DN",,,,"Warshawsky, Daniel N.",,,"Food waste, sustainability, and the corporate sector: case study of a US food company",GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL,,,,Article,,,,,,food waste; food insecurity; food corporation; sustainability; green; United States,SECURITY; BANKING,"Food waste has emerged as one of the world's most critical issues, as record levels of food waste have resulted in negative outcomes for food security, land use, and methane production associated with climate change. As key institutions in the world's food system, retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers have taken steps to reduce food waste. Yet, while food corporations promote their food waste programs as part of their broader green sustainability initiatives, it is unclear how and why they have developed these initiatives. To fill this research gap, this study examines a US company's food waste reduction programs as a case study. To this end, this study utilises interview data of key stakeholders to examine the ways that food waste is produced, regulated, and reused by food corporations. Research findings point to some positive outcomes, such as the transformation of food waste into alternative energy and increased efficiency in food donation systems. Yet, these positive outcomes may be overshadowed by corporate priorities which privilege profitability, brand enhancement, and short-term high-visibility solutions. This research highlights that the broad and somewhat diffuse definition of sustainability may allow corporations to highlight narrow, company-specific technical fixes rather than do the hard work associated with reducing food waste in their supply chains. Moreover, data suggest that many food corporations use the sustainability trope as a way to ensure that they are recognised as legitimate, ethical, and profitable companies. Thus, while some argue that sustainable development institutionalises important environmental practices into the market, evidence from this study suggests that these corporate practices may be evidence of neoliberal environmental governance which is determined by market logics rather than environmental or social justice. In this way, corporate profitability determines how sustainability is defined, when and where sustainability is implemented, and how sustainability is to be measured.","[Warshawsky, Daniel N.] Univ Southern Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy,Hancock AHF B55B, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Warshawsky, DN (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy,Hancock AHF B55B, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",warshaws@usc.edu,,,,,,,67,35,41,8,80,,,,0016-7398,1475-4959,,,,DEC,2016,182,4,,,,,384,394,,10.1111/geoj.12156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geoj.12156,,,,Geography,,Geography,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Food systems integrate social, economic, environmental and health aspects of food production through to consumption. Aquatic foods are an essential part of food systems providing an accessible source of nutrition for millions of people. Yet, it is unclear to what degree research across diverse disciplines concerning aquatic foods has engaged food systems, and the value this concept has added. We conducted a systematic review of fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic food literature (2017-2019) to determine the following: the characteristics of this research; the food systems components and interrelations with which research engaged; and the insights generated on nutrition, justice, sustainability and climate change. Sixty five of the 88 reviewed articles focussed on production and supply chains, with 23 considering human nutrition. Only 13% of studies examined low- and middle-income countries that are most vulnerable to undernutrition. One third of articles looked beyond finfish to other aquatic foods, which illuminated values of local knowledge systems and diverse foods for nutrition. When aggregated, reviewed articles examined the full range of food system drivers-biophysical and environmental (34%), demographic (24%) and socio-cultural (27%)-but rarely examined interactions between drivers. Future research that examines a diversity of species in diets, system-wide flows of nutrients, trade-offs amongst objectives, and the nutritional needs of vulnerable social groups would be nudging closer to the ambitions of the food systems concept, which is necessary to address the global challenges of equity, nutrition and sustainability.","[Simmance, Fiona A.; Cohen, Philippa J.; Huchery, Cindy; Sutcliffe, Sarah; Tezzo, Xavier; Thilsted, Shakuntala H.; McDougall, Cynthia; Freed, Sarah; Byrd, Kendra A.; Wesana, Joshua; Mills, David J.; Akester, Michael; Chan, Chin Yee; Nagoli, Joseph; Wate, Jillian T.; Phillips, Michael J.] WorldFish, George Town, Malaysia; [Cohen, Philippa J.; Huchery, Cindy; Sutcliffe, Sarah; Mills, David J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Cohen, Philippa J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Suri, Sharon K.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tezzo, Xavier; Oosterveer, Peter] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ahern, Molly] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Fisheries Div, Rome, Italy; [Wesana, Joshua] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, London, England; [Cowx, Ian G.] Univ Hull, Hull Int Fisheries Inst, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",CGIAR; Worldfish; James Cook University; University of Tasmania; University of Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Greenwich; University of Hull,"Simmance, FA (corresponding author), WorldFish, George Town, Malaysia.",F.simmance@cgiar.org,,,National Dutch Science Foundation (NWO-WOTRO),National Dutch Science Foundation (NWO-WOTRO),This work was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) led by WorldFish and the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) led by the International Food Policy Research Institute.

The authors derive those for the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. Thereupon, we develop several propositions for future research.Practical implicationsThe authors provide suggestions to practice how to better achieve value in all three sustainability dimensions through implementing a business model perspective, ecosystem thinking, societal demands and Data Governance and AI integration.Social implicationsBy linking societal aspects of Industry 4.0 technologies with environmental, and economic aspects, the authors provide several suggestions how to implement Industry 4.0. For instance, policymakers are recommended to support entire ecosystems than isolated solutions.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to extant literature by conceptualising how Industry 4.0 can leverage value in reaching sustainability in all three dimensions and produce broader ecosystems-wide impacts.","[Mueller, Julian M.] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Mueller, Julian M.] Private Univ Schloss Seeburg, Seekirchen Am Wallersee, Austria; [Kazantsev, Nikolai] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg IfM, Cambridge, England; [Allmendinger, Richard; Salehi-Amiri, Amirhossein] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, England; [Reis, Jacqueline Zonichenn] Univ Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Jaradat, Shaden] Univ Manchester, Fac Sci & Engn, Manchester, England; [Bartolo, Helena] Polytech Inst Leiria, Dept Civil Engn, Leiria, Portugal; [Bartolo, Paulo Jorge Da Silva] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr 3D Printing, Singapore City, Singapore",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Cambridge; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; Universidade Paulista; University of Manchester; Nanyang Technological University,"Müller, JM (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Germany.;Müller, JM (corresponding author), Private Univ Schloss Seeburg, Seekirchen Am Wallersee, Austria.",julian.mueller@fau.de; nk622@cam.ac.uk; Richard.Allmendinger@manchester.ac.uk; seyedamirhossein.salehiamiri@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk; zonichenn@hotmail.com; Shaden.Jaradat@manchester.ac.uk; Helena.bartolo@ipleiria.pt; pbartolo@ntu.edu.sg,,,"ESRC Made Smarter Network+ (InterAct) Commissioned Research Programme, Early Career Researcher Fellowship [723336]; [J17293/ES/W007231/1]","ESRC Made Smarter Network+ (InterAct) Commissioned Research Programme, Early Career Researcher Fellowship;","The second author acknowledges the EC/Horizon 2020 (grant agreement no. 723336), ESRC Made Smarter Network+ (InterAct) Commissioned Research Programme, Early Career Researcher Fellowship number J17293/ES/W007231/1, and the community's role at Clare Hall College (Cambridge) in supporting his scientific work.",,133,0,0,9,9,,,,2040-8021,2040-803X,,,,2024 DEC 11,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/SAMPJ-03-2024-0305,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SAMPJ-03-2024-0305,,DEC 2024,,"Business, Finance; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Management",,Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Innovative technologies and concepts for urban water and wastewater systems already exist, but so far they have only been implemented in pilot projects, mainly as the result of the institutional barriers they face. So how can urban water transformation be encouraged? Qualitative expert interviews, a literature analysis and a series of workshops involving representatives from utilities and stakeholders involved in urban planning were undertaken to identify the key obstacles and encourage action. The current challenges facing the implementation of innovative urban water systems include sector-focused planning approaches, path dependencies (such as technological and mental'' barriers), legal and institutional constraints, and complex structures of responsibilities. New institutional arrangements involving the key players (cooperation models) as well as new processes requiring a reallocation of labour could contribute to a smoother implementation. Innovative water systems present new strategic opportunities for water utilities. Two opportunities that are worthy of consideration in order to fully exploit the benefits of such systems are a strengthening of the water-energy link and an intensification of activities along the water chain''.

In this study, we present our systematic approach to proposing a definition that meets all stakeholders' understanding and extract from the definition an actionable framework. Focusing on total quality management and circular economy frameworks, we followed a two-step approach towards the definition: Conduct a thematic analysis on the body of literature, followed by consultations with green aviation professionals. Green aviation is defined as sustainable aviation practices to minimize environmental impact and continuously improve social wellbeing. This definition is used to extract a conceptual framework to help future research work and sustainability integration into the practitioner's strategic planning. The proposed framework adapts the triple bottom line theory to include an organization's level of social, environmental, and economic integration towards increased 'sustainability value'.

Demand for improved environmental, social and governance performance from supply chains creates an imperative for research to deliver options for farmers to make reductions in their environmental footprint. Given the rapidly evolving nature of greenhouse-gas abatement research, this critical review provides an update on the state of the research relevant to Australian dairy systems and identifies research gaps that must be addressed if there is to be widespread on-farm adoption. Current research suggests that Australian dairy farms could theoretically abate enteric methane by 40-50%, with about another 5-10% reduction in whole-farm greenhouse-gas emissions being possible by flocculating or covering stored effluent. Fertiliser- and urine-patch management strategies could substantially reduce direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions, but by variable amounts subject to local conditions. However, few abatement options are currently cost-effective for farmers. Significantly more research investment is required to facilitate the on-farm adoption of strategies, particularly to reduce enteric methane and improve the efficiency of nitrogen cycling. Improved understanding is required of the influences on each strategy's abatement potential and interactions with economically important traits in grazing systems, the effect of combining abatement strategies, and systems by which strategies can be implemented cost-effectively on farms. The challenge for research is to consider how the implementation of cost-effective abatement options can be refined for grazing dairy systems to maintain the position of Australian dairy in the global market.","[Garnett, L.

Additionally, based on the cumulative and cross-border impacts of pollution discharge in different regions, it is appropriate to use dynamic game theory to study pollution control problems. Therefore, this paper develops a dynamic multi game model to analyze the pollution control game behavior between the upstream and downstream regions along the basin in three scenarios: non-cooperation, pollution abatement cooperation, and ecological compensation. By using the optimal control method, we get the dynamic equilibrium strategies of the government and enterprises and pollution stock trajectories under different cooperation modes. The results show that pollution abatement cooperation can improve the environment, but may not improve social welfare; the eco-compensation mechanism is not always conducive to the improvement of the environment and welfare of the basin, and the effective conditions of implementing ecological compensation is put forward. In addition, we also analyzed the impact of consumer preferences, pollution treatment efficiency, and other parameters on governments and enterprises decision-making and the social welfare.

In Ghana-the world's second biggest cocoa producer-the cocoa sector is challenged by increasing global cocoa demand, climate change impacts, as well as mounting consumer pressure over cocoa's deforestation. Climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has emerged to address these challenges as well as to improve smallholder incomes. As with CSA more widely, there are concerns that CSC discourses will override the interests of cocoa smallholders, and lead to inequitable outcomes. To better understand if and how the implementation of CSC in Ghana can meet its lofty ambitions, we examine (1) the dominant CSC discourses as perceived by stakeholders, and their reflection in policy and practice, and (2) subsequent implications for cocoa smallholders through an equity lens. Through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in Ghana's cocoa sector, we find overwhelming consensus for an ecological modernisation discourse with the promise of a triple win narrative that simultaneously stops deforestation, supports climate mitigation and adaptation, and increases smallholder livelihoods. Moreover, we find that implementing CSC on the ground has generally converged around sustainable intensification and private-sector-led partnerships that aspire to generate a win-win for environment and productivity objectives, but potentially at the expense of delivering equitable outcomes that serve smallholders' interests. We find that the success of CSC and the overly-simplistic sustainable intensification narrative is constrained by the lack of clear tree tenure rights, complexities around optimal shade trees levels, potential rebound effects regarding deforestation, and the risks of agrochemical-dependence. More positively, local governance mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) may give cocoa smallholders a stronger voice to shape policy. However, we caution that the discursive power of dominant private sector actors may risk side-lining equity which could prove detrimental to the long-term wellbeing of Ghana's similar to 800,000 cocoa smallholders.","[Nasser, Felix; Wong, Grace Y.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Maguire-Rajpaul, Victoria A.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Maguire-Rajpaul, Victoria A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Dumenu, William K.] Forestry Inst Ghana, Kumasi, Ghana; [Dumenu, William K.] Univ Freiburg, Environm Econ & Resource Management, Freiburg, Germany",Stockholm University; University of Oxford; University of Cambridge; University of Freiburg,"Nasser, F (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",Felixnasser@gmx.de,,,"Stockholm Resilience Center, Stockholm University; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); UK's Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500112/1]; UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N509711/1]; Stockholm Resilience Centre; EPSRC [EP/N509711/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Stockholm Resilience Center, Stockholm University; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); UK's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Stockholm Resilience Centre; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The fieldwork was partly funded by the Stockholm Resilience Center, Stockholm University, and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

The UK government took the initiative by introducing the Modern Slavery Act in 2015. Despite this, little is known about how companies disclose information about their efforts to tackle modern slavery as required by the Act and the role of corporate governance as a determinant of modern slavery disclosure (MSD) levels. This study, therefore, investigates the extent to which companies engage in MSD and empirically examines the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on MSD. Based on a content analysis of FTSE 100 companies' modern slavery statements during the 2016-2020 period, we find that MSD improved over time but is still relatively low. Our results show that companies pay less attention to the core practices of modern slavery, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), due diligence procedures, risk assessment and management, and training. This evidence suggests that companies tend to comply with the Act by focusing largely on symbolic structures rather than providing a comprehensive disclosure of their impacts on modern slavery practices to minimise regulatory risks and manage stakeholders' perceptions. We also find that boards with greater female representation have a positive and significant association with MSD. This finding is consistent with the gender socialisation theory in that women are more sensitive to communal values and ethics. Consequently, companies with a greater proportion of female directors are more transparent about their strategies and actions related to fighting modern slavery. Furthermore, a critical mass of at least four female directors is necessary before any positive impact on MSD can be observed. Our findings shed new light on this under-researched area and the role of female directors in addressing modern slavery risk and can be of interest to companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders.","[Moussa, Tantawy; Allam, Amir] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, London, England; [Moussa, Tantawy] Cairo Univ, Fac Commerce, Giza, Egypt; [Elmarzouky, Mahmoud] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England; [Moussa, Tantawy] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Westminster; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Aston University; University of Westminster,"Moussa, T (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",t.moussa@westminster.ac.uk,,,British Academy [SRG22\220712]; British Academy [SRG22\\\\220712] Funding Source: British Academy,British Academy(British Academy); British Academy(British Academy),"British Academy, Grant/Award Number:SRG22\220712",,93,13,13,5,37,,,,0964-4733,1099-0836,,,,DEC,2023,32,8,,,,,5382,5402,,10.1002/bse.3426,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3426,,APR 2023,,Business; Environmental Studies; Management,,Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Published",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

B Corporations aim to generate a positive impact, and by seeking certification that validates this premise, they are evaluated in aspects of governance, environment, customers, community, and workers. Such assessment demonstrates attention to various stakeholders and can promote good practices. This research aims to analyse how the circular economy is being internalised in Brazilian B Corps from the perspective of Stakeholder Theory. A total of 264 Brazilian B Corporations were identified, which constitute the units of analysis for the case study. Seventy-six of these responded to questionnaires, and 12 B Corps participated in semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that: (i) circular economy actions through the ReSOLVE framework are partially implemented by B Corps; (ii) circular economy practices require engagement with stakeholders, especially for the share and cycle actions of the ReSOLVE framework that mainly involve customers and the community; (iii) government and consumers were identified as key stakeholders for accelerating the circular economy. The contributions of this study include: (i) presentation of a typology that brings together exploratory theoretical propositions about strategic stakeholders, circular economy assumptions, and business models of B Corps; (ii) correlation between the ReSOLVE framework, B Impact Assessment, and stakeholder theory; (iii) identification of key stakeholders for accelerating the transition to the circular economy.

Due to the spatial separation between consumption and production, the transfer of PM2.5 pollution and its health and economic effects caused by interprovincial trade have not been taken seriously. In this study, economic, atmospheric, and epidemiological models were combined to assess air pollution transfer and its health and economic impacts that are attributed to provincial trade in China. The analyses were performed under the PM2.5 transfer scenario in which economically developed areas in eastern China transferred many health and economic impacts to inland areas through interprovincial trade in 2012.

Current water quality governance involves an overlapping array of policy tools implemented by governments, civil society organizations, and corporate supply chains. The choice of regulatory and voluntary tools is likely to influence many dimensions of the relationship between urban and agricultural actors. These relationships then influence future conditions for collective decision-making since many actors participate for multiple years in water quality improvement. In this policy analysis, we draw on our professional experiences and research, as well as academic and practitioner literatures, to investigate how different types of water quality interventions influence urban-agricultural relationships, specifically examining policy tools on a regulatory to voluntary spectrum. Interactions between farmers and other rural agricultural interests on one hand, and urban residents and their stormwater managers and wastewater treatment plants on the other, influence dynamics relevant for water quality improvement. We suggest that the selection of policy tools within complex governance contexts influence urban-agricultural relationships through financial exchange, political coalitions, knowledge exchange, interpersonal relationships, and shared sense of place. Policy tools that provide a means to build relationships and engage with people's emotions and identities have potential to influence personal and community change and adaptive capacity, while processes such as lawsuits can catalyze structural change. Engaging these relationships is particularly critical given the need to move out of polarized positions to solve collective problems.","[Church, Sarah P.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Traphagen 217, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Floress, Kristin M.] Forest Serv, USDA, Northern Res Stn, 1033 Univ Pl,Suite 360, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Ulrich-Schad, Jessica D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Old Main 224B, Logan, UT 84321 USA; [Wardropper, Chloe B.] Univ Idaho, Dept Nat Resources & Soc, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 1139, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Ranjan, Pranay] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Eaton, Weston M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, 214A Armsby Bldg, State Coll, PA 16802 USA; [Gasteyer, Stephen] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, 401B Berkey Hall,509 E Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Rissman, Adena] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Idaho; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Michigan State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Church, SP (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Traphagen 217, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA.",sarah.church@montana.edu; kristin.m.floress@usda.gov; jessica.schad@usu.edu; cwardropper@uidaho.edu; ranjanp@purdue.edu; eatonwes@psu.edu; gasteyer@msu.edu; arrissman@wisc.edu,,,"United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA); USDA AFRI Grants [2017-67012-25979, 2017-68007-26584]; National Science Foundation [EAR-1855996]",United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA AFRI Grants; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Thank you to our multi-state Hatch research group NC1190, where the ideas for this manuscript began.

Some have argued that this transformation is driven by a supermarket revolution akin to that in North America, Europe and Latin America. Others suggest that the supermarket revolution model oversimplifies complex African realities and that urban food systems are experiencing uneven supermarket penetration in the face of resilient informal food sectors. This paper focuses on Windhoek, Namibia, showing that the city's food system is dominated by South African and local supermarket chains. Since the end of apartheid, South African supermarket chains have expanded their operations into Namibia. Supermarket domination of Windhoek's urban food system is a function of proximity of South Africa and integration into South African supply chains. In other African countries, supermarket penetration has been much slower and is even being reversed. Explanations for uneven penetration in different countries require greater contextualisation and more case study research.","[Nickanor, Ndeyapo; Kazembe, Lawrence N.] Univ Namibia, Dept Stat & Populat Studies, Windhoek, Namibia; [Crush, Jonathan; Wagner, Jeremy] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Sch Int Policy & Governance, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Crush, Jonathan] Univ Western Cape, Dept Geog Environm Studies & Tourism, Bellville, South Africa",University of Namibia; University of Waterloo; University of the Western Cape,"Crush, J (corresponding author), Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Sch Int Policy & Governance, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jcrush@balsillieschool.ca,,,International Development Research Centre; Open Society Foundation for South Africa; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Open Society Foundation for South Africa; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by the International Development Research Centre; Open Society Foundation for South Africa; QES - Advanced Scholars program; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,77,6,6,3,13,,,,0376-835X,1470-3637,,,,MAR 4,2021,38,2,,,,,230,247,,10.1080/0376835X.2020.1819774,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0376835X.2020.1819774,,SEP 2020,,Development Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,,Development Studies; Public Administration,,,Bronze,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This logic, however, overlooks that firms' relocation threats are not equally credible. Focusing on variation in ownership structure, I argue that, even among generally mobile multinational corporations (MNCs), their foreign operations are more credibly movable, and hence more favorably regulated, than their operations at home. MNCs' country-specific investments into the economy and politics of their home markets drive this difference in relative mobility. An empirical analysis that relies on within-firm variation in ownership of MNCs' production sites across European countries and original plant-level carbon regulation data strongly support my argument: foreign ownership becomes an asset for favorable regulation. These findings highlight the need to account for mobility differences among MNCs.","[Bayer, Patrick] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Bayer, P (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Scotland.",patrick.bayer@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,98,3,3,0,3,,,,0022-3816,1468-2508,,,,OCT 1,2023,85,4,,,,,1291,1304,,10.1086/724963,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/724963,,OCT 2023,,Political Science,,Government & Law,,,Green Accepted,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

If so, at what level and by what topographic logic? Is it a region? If so, at what level and by what geographic logic? Are its boundaries natural, political, or multivalent on different scales? In short, this essay looks at the special (re)production of environmental conditions within a cyborg world. Here, the Valley is comprised of (a) Colorado River water; (2) migratory waterfowl; (3) the accidentally manufactured, but intentionally seeded food chain of the Salton Sea (3) the San Andreas Fault, (4) Mexican field labor; (5) public universities extension services; (6) global markets and supply chains; (7) international biotechnology, chemical and seed conglomerates, and (8) state and federal regulation of water rights, regulations and markets. The Valley is a cyborg, a historical entity comprised interdependently of nature, technoscience and humanity. This, characterization, however, raises problems with conceptions of the massive losses of migratory waterfowl from avian cholera at the Salton Sea, the agroecological devastation caused by the unintentional introduction of the Silver Leaf whitefly, and the wastage of constrained water rights as environmental crises of nature. The articulation of a cyborg perspective sees the environmental conditions of the Valley as the product of relations comprised of uneven and indeterminate ecological process, techno scientific trajectories, and human practices. Extending the cyborg's integration of nature, technology and social agency, a relational reading of James O'Connor's second contradiction of capitalism thesis is developed. O'Connor's political ecology and Haraway material serniotics, while broadly operating at different levels of analysis, prove surprisingly resonant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this context, the focus of this perspective shifts toward plasma technology, which has demonstrated the capability to convert methane into ethylene. Plasma catalysis creates distinctive physical and chemical environments, particularly at normal temperature and pressure, distinguishing it from alternative methods. Nevertheless, the utilization of atmospheric pressure plasma is intricate, posing scientific challenges in the realms of physics and chemistry. In this viewpoint, various key performance aspects are evaluated, encompassing methane conversion efficiency, ethylene selectivity, and specific energy input. These scientific pros and cons are then assessed for their readiness for industrial -scale implementation. Initially, the potential for small-scale ethylene production is examined, leveraging existing robust process technologies to unlock fresh market and supply chain opportunities. Subsequently, the sustain -ability of plasma technology for green ethylene production is compared to conventional ethylene production and alternative green ethylene production methods, including biomass-based approaches. Contrary to perhaps optimistic expectations, current literature evidence does not uniformly favor the latter, indicating the potential for plasma-based green ethylene processes. Additionally, this paper underscores the importance of considering Environmental, Social, and Governance factors that influence business decisions. Finally, this review underscores plasma technology as a potentially promising approach for green ethylene synthesis from methane, offering unique advantages under normal conditions while simultaneously presenting scientific challenges. It assesses its viability for small-scale production and benchmarks its sustainability against conventional and alternative methods, emphasizing the importance of a sustainable future for the green petrochemical industry.","[Lamichhane, Pradeep; Pourali, Nima; Rebrov, Evgeny V.; Hessel, Volker] Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry CV4 7AL, England; [Scott, Lauren] Alkcon Corp, 11930 44th St North, Clearwater, FL 33762 USA; [Tran, Nam N.; Hessel, Volker] Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn, Adelaide 5005, Australia; [Tran, Nam N.] Can Tho Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Mekong Delta 92000, Vietnam; [Lin, Liangliang] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Chem & Mat Engn, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Gelonch, Marc Escriba] Univ Lleida, EPS Sch Chem Engn, Igualada 08700, Spain; [Rebrov, Evgeny V.] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Chem Engn & Chem, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",University of Warwick; University of Adelaide; Can Tho University; Jiangnan University; Universitat de Lleida; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Hessel, V (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Coventry CV4 7AL, England.",volker.hessel@adelaide.edu.au,,,European Commission [810182]; ERC Synergy Grant Surface-COnfined fast modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification (SCOPE),European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); ERC Synergy Grant Surface-COnfined fast modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification (SCOPE),"This work is supported from the ERC Synergy Grant Surface-COnfined fast modulated Plasma for process and Energy intensification (SCOPE) , from the European Commission, with Grant No. 810182.",,147,14,14,12,41,,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,JAN,2024,189,,B,,,,,,114044,10.1016/j.rser.2023.114044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.114044,,NOV 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is crucial, however, that this biomass be grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. International processes and certification systems have been developed to ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) in general, but it is important to consider if they adequately address specific impacts of intensified production and harvesting methods related to forest fuels. To explore how existing SFM frameworks address sustainable forest fuel production, criteria and indicators (C&I) from 10 different international processes and organizations and 157 international, national and sub-national forest management certification standards under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) were reviewed. International processes include indicators that require identification or reporting of availability, harvested amounts, value, or share in energy consumption of forest fuels. Forest certification standards address several specific woodfuel issues, but not always in a consistent manner. It seems that developed countries more frequently address environmental consequences of harvesting residues or whole trees on soil fertility and biodiversity, while developing countries more frequently address social issues, such as local people's access to firewood and working conditions in charcoal production. Based on findings, options to improve SFM standards for sustainable forest fuel production are discussed. These options include clarification of terminology, systematic inclusion of important management impacts unique to forest fuel production, coordination of efforts with other related governance processes, including tools promoting sustainability at more integrated levels, such as landscape, supply chain and global levels.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unexpected difficulties in the operations of most companies, leading to a significant deterioration in their financial performance. We use empirical analysis to examine whether a company's ESG activities affect its financial performance. We employ the context-dependent data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to evaluate the performance and provide a benchmark-learning roadmap for 27 photoelectric companies in Taiwan. We also compare the marketability, innovation ability, and profitability of three sub-industries: camera modules, optical component lenses, and optical components. Furthermore, we utilize a combination of classical DEA, stratification DEA, measurement of attractiveness, and progress for company evaluation. The results indicate that validating sustainability reports has a positive information effect, and high-quality Global Reporting Initiative-based external third-party confirmed reports possess relatively high credibility, readability, and information value. The content and quality of these reports have an impact on performance. These findings offer insights into the role of ESG activities in the photoelectric industry and can help managers reflect upon and justify their choice to invest in specific ESG activities.

This bibliometric analysis signals the emergence of a substantial research community based in Asia and the Middle East, whose production is distinct from North American and European-centric evaluation studies. While the latter primarily address methodological challenges related to sustainability issues in social policy, organizational capacity building, and public health, the broader SA literature centers on life-cycle assessments to integrate the analysis of environmental and socioeconomic effects in such domains as biodiversity, energy efficiency, urban planning, alternative agriculture, and supply chain management. This mapping exercise highlights the global distribution of research output and identifies existing gaps and potential future cross-fertilization. The transdisciplinary SA literature can draw from theory-based designs attuned to complexity and systems thinking.

Under this context, corporate green innovation should be urgently guided, which is an important subject to be studied and solved with great urgency to achieve harmonious ecological and economic growth. In this study, the data of 836 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020 are selected, carbon market and digital transformation are integrated into a unified analysis framework, and the green innovation effect and mechanism of the two and their interaction terms are investigated, not showing consistency with the previous studies about the effect of carbon market or digital transformation on green innovation. The present study suggests that (i) both carbon market policy and digitalization level serve as vital factors in boosting green innovation among high-carbon companies, whereas the synthetic effect of carbon market policy and digital transformation inhibits corporate green innovation behavior. (ii) The influences exerted by carbon market policy, digital transformation, and the synthetic effect on green innovation are dependent on property rights, size, and industry of high-carbon companies. (iii) As revealed by the analysis of mediating effects, financing constraints are the main mechanism of action that leads to a negative correlation between the synthetic effect of the carbon market and digital transformation and green innovation. Besides, R & D investment and environmental information disclosure only affect the action mechanism about digital transformation and carbon market policy, whereas they do not affect the synthetic effect of carbon market and digital transformation. Therefore, to promote green innovation and green transformation of high carbon companies, the government needs to flexibly use market-based environmental regulation tools (e.g., carbon market), strengthen the influence exerted by digital technology in improving innovation quality, and flexibly formulate relevant policies in accordance with the heterogeneity of different objects.","[Wang, Di] Peking Univ, Sch Govt, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Di] Peking Univ, Inst Publ Governance, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Dou, Wei] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Resource Management, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Beijing Normal University,"Wang, D (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Govt, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Wang, D (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Publ Governance, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",surpassyourself@vip.163.com,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [22YJC790120]; Key support project for academic team building of Institute of Public Governance,Peking University [TDXM202106]","Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); Key support project for academic team building of Institute of Public Governance,Peking University","This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, Award number:22YJC790120; the Key support project for academic team building of Institute of Public Governance,Peking University,Award number TDXM202106.",,73,11,11,24,160,,,,1387-585X,1573-2975,,,,SEP,2024,26,9,,,,,22775,22800,,10.1007/s10668-023-03575-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03575-5,,JUL 2023,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to investigate the driving forces that influence the adoption of environmentally friendly logistics activities. Following a detailed literature review, a theoretical model, which encompassed several driving forces and logistics activities, has been developed. Survey-based quantitative data were collected from logistics service providers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and analysed using structural equation modelling methodology and multiple regression analysis. Through answering 110 questionnaires, respondents holding different managerial levels at logistics service organizations, provided data reflecting their perception of the forces that would influence the adoption of green logistics practices. The driving forces (legislations, customers, and organizational awareness) were found to influence the adoption of green logistics practices by the logistics service industry in the areas of warehousing, packaging and transportation.","[Salhieh, L.; Abushaikha, I.] German Jordanian Univ, Sch Management & Logist Sci, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan",German-Jordanian University,"Abushaikha, I (corresponding author), German Jordanian Univ, Sch Management & Logist Sci, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan.",ismail.abushaikha@gju.edu.jo,,,,,,,78,11,13,2,29,,,,2078-5585,2078-5976,,,,DEC,2016,47,4,,,,,59,69,,10.4102/sajbm.v47i4.75,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajbm.v47i4.75,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper introduces dynamic differential games to capture the temporal evolution and adjustment of strategies, examining dynamic game strategies under different compensation scenarios (non-horizontal ecological compensation, horizontal ecological compensation and fully shared ecological compensation). A new interest distribution model is proposed, with empirical analysis conducted using Shanghai as a case study to validate the reliability and feasibility of the model. The findings indicate: (1) Government intervention combined with horizontal ecological compensation significantly improves waste management efficiency and urban welfare. The compensation mechanism fosters regional cooperation, optimizes resource allocation, reduces decision-making conflicts and enhances overall processing effectiveness. (2) Without a compensation mechanism, high costs in export regions and low benefits in import regions result in low cooperation willingness. The ecological compensation mechanism enhances willingness to cooperate by fairly distributing costs and benefits, optimizing long-term cooperation and overall gains. (3) Complete shared ecological compensation is optimal, though partial shared mechanisms are also effective in practice. Proper interest and ecological compensation ratios can significantly improve waste management efficiency and urban environment, strengthening long-term cooperation. The study theoretically expands the dynamic optimization and cooperation mechanism analysis in waste management, provides solutions for environmental policy formulation in cross-regional waste handling and offers new perspectives and tools for addressing complex issues in cross-regional environmental governance, including targeted policy recommendations with practical significance for enhancing cross-regional waste management.","[Li, Mengdi; Han, Chuanfeng] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Meng, Lingpeng] Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, 1550,Haigang Ave,Pudong New Area, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Shao, Zhiguo] Qingdao Univ Technol, Sch Management Engn, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Pihui] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Management Engn, Jinan, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Shanghai Maritime University; Qingdao University of Technology; Shandong Jianzhu University,"Meng, LP (corresponding author), Shanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, 1550,Haigang Ave,Pudong New Area, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",lpmeng@shmtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974122, 71874123, 71972127, 72304161]; National Social Science Foundation of China [23AZD073]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2022QG029, ZR2023QG066]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers 71974122, 71874123, 71972127, 72304161; National Social Science Foundation of China, grant number 23AZD073; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, grant numbers ZR2022QG029, ZR2023QG066.",,58,1,1,16,16,,,,0734-242X,1096-3669,,,,2024 NOV 28,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/0734242X241299099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X241299099,,NOV 2024,,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The required changes in the current food system must be achieved while reducing the negative environmental impacts of current farming practices on our climate and biodiversity and avoiding deforestation. This formidable challenge must be overcome in a projected climate that is more variable and where extreme weather events are increasingly common. While the green revolution, agricultural land expansion and agrotechnological innovations have significantly increased crop productivity over the last 50 years, the gains in the yields of most major crops have reached a plateau. Moreover, global hunger remains at a record high. Climate change-associated changes in weather patterns have decreased the yields of major crops. Further land expansion is impossible without severe trade-offs with biodiversity and climate change mitigation. Wars and pandemics are currently severely disrupting the global agri-food system, increasing prices and exacerbating food insecurity, with the world's poorest suffering the most. The climate change-social instability nexus will continue to cause additional stress to the agri-food system. Here, we consider the inequities in the current food system, highlighting the weak interconnection among research, policy and societal action that is hindering mitigation and adaptation efforts. We argue that improved interconnections among research, policy, governance and societal action will unlock the potential to achieve food security while supporting climate change mitigation targets. Our analysis includes specific strategies such as strengthening small-scale farmers, promoting fair trade practices and reducing food waste to achieve these goals.","[Onyeaka, Helen; Miri, Taghi] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, England; [Onyeaka, Helen; Jabbour, Liza] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Inst Sustainabil & Climate Act BISCA, Birmingham, England; [Duan, Keru; Pang, Gu] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, England; [Shiu, Eric] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Birmingham, England; [Pokhilenko, Irina; Frew, Emma; Fu, Lin; Osifowora, Bisola] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Ctr Econ Obes, Birmingham, England; [Ogtem-Young, Ozlem] Univ Birmingham, Ctr Household Assets & Savings Management CHASM, Sch Social Policy, Dept Social Policy, Birmingham, England; [Jabbour, Liza] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Management, Birmingham, England; [Miles, Kathryn] Univ Birmingham, Res Strategy & Serv Div, Res Strategy & Dev Partner Engn & Phys Sci, Life & Environm Sci, Birmingham, England; [Khan, Amil] Univ Birmingham, External Relat, Birmingham, England; [Foyer, Christine H.] Univ Birmingham, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Sch Biosci, Birmingham, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Onyeaka, H; Miri, T (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, England.",onyeakah@bham.ac.uk; t.miri@bham.ac.uk,,,,,Not applicable.,,111,0,0,8,10,,,,2048-3694,,,,,JUL,2024,13,4,,,,,,,e572,10.1002/fes3.572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fes3.572,,,,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Food Science & Technology,,Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Food Science & Technology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study extends existing research on relationship management by exploring the effects of various transaction constraints on the use of contracts and relational norms. It also examines the effects of these two mechanisms on outsourcing performance. The analysis of data from 264 Chinese firms engaged in logistics outsourcing indicates that demand volatility has a negative effect on contracts but has no significant effect on relational norms. Supply volatility exerts an inverse U-shape effect on relational norms, but has no significant effect on contracts. When technology uncertainty prevails, firms are likely to increase their use of either contracts or relational norms. In contrast, when vendor contribution is highly unpredictable, firms will simultaneously reduce their use of contracts and relational norms. Furthermore, although relational norms enhance satisfaction more effectively than contracts, their positive effects on financial performance are not significantly different. These findings enrich relationship management research, especially with regard to control mode selection in situations of transaction uncertainty. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many publications address incorporating ESG, but only some deal with it from the perspective of business models. This paper fills that gap. The methods of incorporating ESG risk into a sustainable business model, identified on the basis of the literature review, were verified based on the examples of three companies from the energy industry. A two-stage review of publications from the WoS and Scopus databases was carried out, considering a more comprehensive (sustainability) and a narrower (ESG risk) range of keywords, and the period from 2000 to 2022. The result showed that SMEs and large enterprises consider ESG risk in their risk management systems (ERMs), while small enterprises and start-ups do not. In Europe, Asia, and Australia, it is common to include ESG risk in an ERM, while it is rare in Latin America. In developing countries, companies in the service sector are more likely to include ESG risk in ERMs than those in the manufacturing sector. These findings may be useful for policymakers who wish to provide support and financial incentives for companies transforming their business models toward sustainability.","[Ziolo, Magdalena] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Bak, Iwona] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Econ, Janickiego 31, PL-71270 Szczecin, Poland; [Spoz, Anna] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Inst Econ & Finance, Aleje Raclawickie 14, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",University of Szczecin; West Pomeranian University of Technology; Catholic University of Lublin,"Spoz, A (corresponding author), John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Inst Econ & Finance, Aleje Raclawickie 14, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",aspoz@kul.lublin.pl,,,National Science Centre Poland (NCN) [OPUS16 2018/31/B/HS4/00570],"National Science Centre Poland (NCN)(National Science Centre, Poland)","Free of charge publication.

We investigate whether capital markets negatively value a broader concept of carbon risk exposure in addition to its historic carbon footprint and offset assessed penalties by considering carbon mitigation activities undertaken by the firm. We develop a conceptual framework of a firm's 'carbon risk profile' from the literature comprising: (a) carbon risk exposure (current emissions and broader risk notions of fossil fuel dependency and carbon visibility); and (b) carbon mitigation activities (realized emissions reductions and anticipatory proactive activities). We confirm and operationalize this framework using interviews with managers and environmental, social, and governance analysts. Based on a sample of 310 firm-year observations for ASX200 firms from 2014-2020 in high-carbon sectors, our results suggest material valuation penalties for the broader carbon risk exposure concept. Further, we find that capital markets attach value to a firm's intangible capability to proactively mitigate its carbon risk exposure. Building on these results, to further mobilize capital markets in the push towards net zero emissions, policymakers and regulators may wish to undertake initiatives to increase carbon-related disclosures on both risks and mitigation activities.","[Millar, Ingrid] Griffith Univ, Nathan, QLD, Australia; [Clarkson, Peter] Simon Fraser Univ, Univ Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; [Clarkson, Peter] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Herbohn, Kathleen] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia",Griffith University; University of Queensland; Simon Fraser University; University of Queensland,"Clarkson, P (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Univ Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.;Clarkson, P (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",p.clarkson@business.uq.edu.au; p.clarkson@business.uq.edu.au,,,,,No Statement Available,,118,0,0,25,26,,,,0001-3072,1467-6281,,,,2024 OCT 3,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/abac.12344,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/abac.12344,,OCT 2024,,"Business, Finance",,Business & Economics,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little is known about the regulatory behaviour and motivations of operators to comply with this regulation. We explore the regulatory behaviour of companies by applying a synthesis of behavioural theories of regulatory compliance and transnational market regulation. Informed by qualitative and quantitative mixed methods, this study finds that EUTR compliance is influenced by operators' regulative, economic, normative and cultural-cognitive motivations. The empirical analyses reveal that larger, publicly exposed companies are driven to comply through social pressure and the deterrence effect of sanctions and control. Operators' perceptions of the costs and benefits do not explain compliance behaviour in a significant, quantitative way.

Blight is a complex problem with varied consequences requiring integrated decision making at both individual and community levels. This is an important issue since residents of blighted areas live in environments that directly influence their quality of life, values and behaviors. This study conducts an economic, social, and environmental analysis regarding impacts, intermediation and eradication of blight. The complexity of blight requires an analysis encompassing both objective and subjective variables. Also, this study addresses limitations of prior research by applying a methodology that combines cognitive mapping and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. Study results include a multi-criteria analysis system based on the inputs provided by a panel of experts. Although process-oriented, where results generally are not applicable from one application to another, our approach resulted in blight-caused impacts being allocated to four major clusters: governance; construction and real estate market; social dimensions and security; and health and environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only the market but also how businesses have managed their supply chains and production. COVID-19 has been claimed to be a test of a company's long-term viability. Sustainability refers to a company's ability to last a long time (corporate longevity). The tug of war between economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social justice that guarantees enterprises are profitable and sustainable is the main issue for companies in developing governance. From a theoretical standpoint, longevity is an intriguing problem. There are two types of corporate longevity: corporate longevity (CL) and corporate sustainable longevity (CSL). Little research has specifically examined the internal aspects of CSL. It necessitates several specific characteristics that all play a role in CSL. This research intends to highlight operational resilience as a crucial predictor of CSL's significance in the jamu business. Companies that have consistently produced and benefitted from their business operations, before, during, and after the pandemic, have faced challenges of sustainability or longevity. Predecessor independent variables, and moderating or mediating variables, can be used to enable the operational resilience stance. To achieve CSL, the company must know how much it will determine its position in numerous ways in company practice. This study contributes to exploring dimensions and indicators of operational resilience to determine CSL in its relevance to the jamu industry. Different roles for operational resilience in different industry practices are also feasible.","[Irawan, Dadang; Prabowo, Harjanto; Kuncoro, Engkos Achmad] Bina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch, Doctorate Program, Res Management, Jakarta 11480, Indonesia; [Thoha, Nurianna] Bina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch, Management Dept, Int Business Program,Int Undergrad Program, Jakarta 11480, Indonesia",Universitas Bina Nusantara; Universitas Bina Nusantara,"Irawan, D (corresponding author), Bina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch, Doctorate Program, Res Management, Jakarta 11480, Indonesia.",irawan.150175@gmail.com; harprabowo@binus.edu; eak@binus.edu; nurianna@binus.edu,,,,,,,61,3,3,4,31,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,6431,10.3390/su14116431,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116431,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the changing needs of society and the advancement of technology, the agricultural product circulation system needs to undergo corresponding changes to adapt to the modern fast-paced social system. Blockchain technology couples with the circulation of agricultural products, as its technical features, such as immutability and a distributed ledger database, ensures the speed and stability of the key information circulation process of agricultural products. The research goal of this paper was to clarify the influence of blockchain technology on the qualification rate and circulation efficiency for agricultural products. Based on the main characteristics of blockchain technology and a summary of domestic and foreign theoretical research, this paper simulated the impacts of blockchain technology on the agricultural product circulation system. The results revealed that blockchain technology can improve the qualification rate of agricultural products and thereby ensure their quality and safety. The introduction of blockchain increased the qualification rate by nearly 30%. Moreover, blockchain technology significantly enhanced the efficiency of the agricultural product circulation system, thereby greatly promoting economic benefits. The introduction of blockchain increased circulation efficiency by nearly 15%. Finally, the introduction of blockchain technology can effectively promote the governance level and reduce the supervision costs of the agricultural product circulation system. Through simulation analysis, we found that blockchain technology has a positive impact on both the qualification rate and circulation efficiency for agricultural products. These findings enrich research into the application of blockchain technology in the management and circulation of modern agricultural products.","[Wang, Liukun; Qi, Chunjie; Jiang, Peng; Xiang, Si] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University,"Qi, CJ (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",liukunwang@webmail.hzau.edu.cn; qichunjie@mail.hzau.edu.cn; peng.jiang1@outlook.com; xiangsi0123@126.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [16BJY136]; Special Fund for National Modern Agriculture (Citrus) Industrial Technology System (MATS) [CARS-26-06BY],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Special Fund for National Modern Agriculture (Citrus) Industrial Technology System (MATS),This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 16BJY136) and by the Special Fund for National Modern Agriculture (Citrus) Industrial Technology System (MATS) (Grant No. CARS-26-06BY).,,49,7,7,12,92,,,,,1660-4601,,,,JUL,2022,19,13,,,,,,,7686,10.3390/ijerph19137686,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19137686,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

These pressures stem from the global focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and their association with risk management and corporate resilience. As a result, understanding the connection between sustainability and performance indicators, such as return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), is crucial to determine whether sustainable practices positively influence financial outcomes or primarily serve to address external expectations. This study seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence by employing a rigorous methodological approach-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)-to assess the impact of sustainability practices on key performance measures. The inclusion of a diverse range of industries from the US and Europe enhances the relevance of the findings, as it facilitates their generalization across developed economies where sustainability initiatives are highly prioritized. Our results are consistent with prior research demonstrating a positive relationship between sustainability and financial performance, particularly in high-development contexts over a medium-term period. These findings carry important implications for managers and policymakers, emphasizing that sustainability is not a compromise but a catalyst for economic and financial profitability. This study contributes to the literature by illustrating how sustainability can simultaneously advance ethical objectives and enhance financial performance, establishing it as a critical area of focus for both academics and practitioners.","[Estebanez, Raquel Perez; Martin, Francisco Javier Sevillano] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Accounting & Finance, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Estébanez, RP; Martín, FJS (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Accounting & Finance, Madrid 28040, Spain.",raperez@ucm.es; fjsevill@ucm.es,,,,,,,51,0,0,16,16,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JAN,2025,17,1,,,,,,,297,10.3390/su17010297,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17010297,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the growing body of research on energy emergency management, existing studies primarily focus on power system risks and disaster mitigation, often neglecting theoretical and quantitative approaches for fossil energy emergency scheduling under extreme weather conditions. This study addresses this gap by introducing an improved supernetwork-based model designed as an instrumental and structured framework for fossil energy emergency scheduling. The model integrates multiple energy sources, transportation modes, hierarchical levels, and objectives, incorporating both affected and unaffected regions as subnetworks. The analysis encompasses the entire logistics chain, detailing the transportation of oil, coal, and natural gas via road, rail, waterways, and pipelines from storage facilities to receiving locations through transit hubs. A novel parameter calculation approach is developed, leveraging the extreme weather risk indicator (EWRI) to quantify the vulnerability of transportation networks and assess extreme weather impacts. The supernetwork model incorporates these parameters, enabling unified decision-making by regulatory authorities to optimize emergency scheduling paths, volumes, and transportation modes. Solutions are derived using variational inequality formulations and a modified projection algorithm. Validated through a numerical example, the proposed model demonstrates accuracy, practicality, and computational simplicity. This improved supernetwork offers a robust quantitative tool for fossil energy emergency scheduling applicable across diverse countries and regions, with potential extensions to other domains requiring emergency scheduling and route optimization under adverse conditions.","[Chen, Ze-Chang; Li, Chong-Mao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian 710129, Peoples R China; [Li, Chong-Mao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Int Ctr Global Governance Res, Xian 710129, Peoples R China; [Li, Chong-Mao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710129, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ze-Chang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University; Renmin University of China,"Li, CM (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian 710129, Peoples R China.",li.chongmao@nwpu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [23BGL216],National Social Science Fund of China,Acknowledgments This research was funded by National Social Science Fund of China (grant number 23BGL216) .,,107,0,0,0,0,,,,0360-5442,1873-6785,,,,MAY 1,2025,322,,,,,,,,135491,10.1016/j.energy.2025.135491,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2025.135491,,,,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,,Thermodynamics; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In many countries, its workforce consists mostly of precariously employed immigrant and resident foreign-born workers. Categorized as essential workers, they worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while facing high infection risk. Using case-studies in three country contexts - Illinois/USA, the Netherlands, and North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany - we analyzed policy documents, investigative reports, publicly available data, and informal expert consultation to examine structural causes of protection gaps for workers in the meat industry as well as facilitators and barriers to improving occupational safety and health. The Framework Method was applied to systematize and compare the overall data.Our analysis yields two key findings: First, immigrant workers in the meat industry face similar structural conditions across country contexts, with intersecting immigration- and employment-related precarity, generating gaps in social and health protection and deficiencies in the realization of theoretically held rights. Second, as policy responses to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks varied, our case-studies showcase fundamentally different approaches to state responsibility for worker wellbeing as part of food supply chain (FSC) governance. The sacrificial-worker approach, observed in Illinois/USA, prioritized industry interests over worker and public health. In the Netherlands, a passive government delegated responsibilities to industry actors who forestalled systemic change through ad hoc adjustments, leaving the core problem of workers' precarity intact. In Germany, the government leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic as a catalyst for change by enforcing a ban on subcontracting workers in the meat industry, with the potential to fundamentally shift industrial relations and thus address the root causes of worker precarity. Our results highlight economic liberalization and related worker precarity as central determinants of health inequities; and they underscore the imperative for more equitable social and health protection of all workers as part of FSC governance, and as part of food systems transformation for sustainability.","[Gottlieb, Nora] Bielefeld Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Med & Hlth Serv Res AG2, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Jungwirth, Ingrid; Glassner, Marius] Rhine Waal Univ Appl Sci, Fac Soc & Econ, Marie Curie Str 1, D-47533 Kleve, Germany; [de Lange, Tesseltje; Mantu, Sandra] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Migrat Law, Fac Law, POB 9049, NL-6500 KK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Forst, Linda] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci, 1603 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",University of Bielefeld; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Gottlieb, N (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Med & Hlth Serv Res AG2, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",nora.gottlieb@uni-bielefeld.de,,,European Union Horizon 2022,European Union Horizon 2022,"We would like to thank UIC students Syeda Imam and Michaela Beamon-Richardson, Radboud University student-assistant Giulia Ledda and Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences student-assistant Federica Pilotti for their research assistance.

Therefore, the remanufacturing firm needs to combine acquisition management with remanufacturing planning. Used products are often collected from a large number of end users, and acquisition pricing is adopted to control the return quantity of the used product. In this paper, we study a multiperiod acquisition pricing and remanufacturing decision problem under random price-sensitive returns. First, the problem is formulated into a two-decision periodic review inventory model, the decomposition property of which is proved, and thus, the problem can be decomposed into two subproblems with single decision variable. Second, we acquire the solution structure of the optimal remanufacturing quantity, which is a basic inventory policy not influenced by random returns. Next, we analyze characteristics of the optimal acquisition price and derive a monotonic pricing policy depending on the starting level of the whole inventory in each period. Further, an algorithm is designed to calculate the optimal inventory level and acquisition price of each period, which holds a lower computational complexity. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm and to conduct managerial insights of main parameters.","[Sun, Xiaochen] Tianjin Univ, Sch Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongjian] Nankai Univ, Sch Business, China Acad Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Zhou, Yancong] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Informat Engn, Tianjin 300134, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Nankai University; University of Southern Denmark; Tianjin University of Commerce,"Li, YJ (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Sch Business, China Acad Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",xcsun@tju.edu.cn; liyongjian@nankai.edu.cn; gov@sam.sdu.dk; zycong78@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71002106, 70971069]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-11-0252]; MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [12JJD630004]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT0926]; Forsknings-og Innovationsstyrelsen for 'The International Network programme: Sustainable supply chain management: A step toward Environmental and Social Initiatives' [2211916]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)); Forsknings-og Innovationsstyrelsen for 'The International Network programme: Sustainable supply chain management: A step toward Environmental and Social Initiatives',"This research is supported by (1) the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Research Fund Nos. 71002106 and 70971069 for X.C.

Meanwhile, an F-MCDM (F-Multi-criteria Decision Making) model was created to capture the interactions among the influencing factors, identifying eight key influencing factors and four possible countermeasures. The results revealed that policy and institutional innovation, incentives and investment ecology, efficient implementation and coordination mechanisms, and supply chain and technology security capacity are four crucial challenges for CRII. Among them, the cooperation modes between the central government and local governments, as well as among local governments, were identified as the most critical factors. Accordingly, a four-pronged framework of policy alignment, cooperative incentives, operational excellence, and supply assurance was developed to better promote CRII.

The circular economy (CE) principles in community energy ini-tiatives can help shift the existing energy pattern and transform society to better understand the Sustainable De-velopment Goals (SDGs). This study aims to structure and evaluate the preference of stakeholders' objectives for community energy formation in the era of the CE to accelerate clean energy transitions. The conscious use of en-ergy while participating in energy projects helps reduce energy consumption, reuse waste, and redesign commu-nity grid expansion with climate protection objectives. These links are explored systematically by integrating the value-focused thinking (VFT) approach and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Using the VFT approach helped uncover strategic objectives of maximizing values of community energy using CE measures. Moreover, AHP assisted in identifying the preferred set of values as the results indicate that technical categories are fundamental pressure points for implementing CE principles in such initiatives. This study's contribution falls at the intersec-tion of these concepts, where community energy initiatives provide a platform to integrate CE strategies. This study helps realize the rebound effects of consumer-centric community energy initiatives considering CE princi-ples from a governance literature perspective. From a strategical standpoint, it signifies the potential links between CE and community energy initiatives. The adoption of CE measures has been seen as a win-win solu-tion to the community energy business models and improves economic, environmental, and social sustainability.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The latter can be measured by the port congestion situation so the mitigation of congestion helps improve customers' experience. We observe that smart ports are widely built and many local governments are promoting port integration to ease competition and reduce congestion. One immediate question is: Are the two strategies really effective that further enable the improvement of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) performance? In this study, by taking the do-nothing strategy as the benchmark, we examine how smart port and port integration strategies work in port congestion reduction and ESG improvement. We reveal that the smart port strategy brings the Matthew effect that the large port obtains a larger market share and the smaller port worries about the win-lose situation. We also reveal that smart port can make each port and the entire port system more congested, resulting in the investment dilemma. Differently, the port integration strategy can effectively reduce congestion but hurt social welfare. We further discuss a mixed strategy where both strategies are implemented. Interestingly, under the mixed strategy, the risk of falling into the investment dilemma can be reduced and social welfare can be increased. We compare the ESG performances under three strategies and highlight that the mixed strategy achieves the highest system profit, the smart port strategy yields the highest social welfare, and the port integration strategy may outperform the other strategies in terms of environmental sustainability.","[Niu, Baozhuang; Dong, Jian; Wang, Hongzhi] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Wang, HZ (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",bmniubz@scut.edu.cn; dongjian677@yeah.net; whz1532843164@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72125006, 72293564/72293560]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors are grateful to the editor and reviewers for their helpful comments.

The green energy transition relies heavily on metals, such as aluminium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, nickel, rare earth elements (REEs), silicon, tin, titanium, tungsten and zinc, among others. However, this transition occurs within the context of: (1) a geographical concentration of known mineral deposits and downstream capability; (2) a demand that vastly exceeds supply; (3) a strong drive to mitigate environmental and energy concerns; and (4) an increasing level of geopolitical conflicts. Consequently, the energy transition is not straightforward, as it intensifies material demand, market and geopolitical competition. This is especially true for lithium which is pivotal in this transformation. Concerns driven by material access, energy sustainability and national sufficiency are increasingly resulting in national and super-national geopolitical activities, such as resource nationalisation, forming strategic or trade alliances, encouraging near- and friend-shoring, promoting material circularity, and accelerating green technology research and deployment. This study examines the global impact of the green energy transition, from the perspective of the mineral value chain, including downstream products, its implications on the projected demand, and geopolitics. There are many potential outcomes in the future, depending on: (1) the pragmatic outcomes of the energy transition, which is only empirically realizable through implementation; (2) the strength of independence and global stability; and (3) the rise of regional or friendly trade blocs. In particular, this study examines a future scenario in which there is an emergence of an OPEC-style organisation for green energy minerals and metals (GEMMs), focusing on lithium as an example, because: (1) it has a clear and essential role in the green energy transition; (2) it is geographically concentrated in a manner that facilitates production coordination; and (3) it is overwhelmingly consumed by developed nations but supplied by developing nations. An organisation built around lithium could be a prototype to other GEMM markets. Consequently, we propose that it is possible to leverage existing circumstances and propose that such an organisation, here termed Green Energy-Mineral Exporting Countries, or GEMEC, could serve as a collaborative platform to enhance geopolitical positioning, maximise economic benefits through coordinated production and export policies, and address the environmental, social and governance challenges associated with the green energy transition.","[Ghorbani, Yousef] Univ Lincoln, Sch Chem, Joseph Banks Labs, Green Lane, Lincoln LN6 7DL, Lincs, England; [Zhang, Steven E.; Bourdeau, Julie E.] 39 Kiewiet St,Helikon Pk, ZA-1759 Randfontein, South Africa; [Chipangamate, Nelson S.; Nwaila, Glen T.] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Min Inst, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, ZA-2000 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rose, Derek H.] Mintek, Mineral Div, 200 Malibongwe Dr, ZA-2194 Randburg, South Africa; [Valodia, Imraan] Univ Witwatersrand, Southern Ctr Inequal Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Valodia, Imraan] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Lincoln; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand,"Ghorbani, Y (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Sch Chem, Joseph Banks Labs, Green Lane, Lincoln LN6 7DL, Lincs, England.",yghorbani@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,146,15,15,17,43,,,,0301-4207,1873-7641,,,,MAR,2024,90,,,,,,,,104737,10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.104737,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.104737,,FEB 2024,,Environmental Studies,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this research is to characterize the process by which organizational collectives.Design/methodology/approachThis is a case study of six private healthcare establishments mobilized around an organizational project. A seven-month research-intervention was carried out with six healthcare establishments mobilized around an organizational human resources (HR) project. The transformative aim was to encourage the emergence of an organizational collective by playing a functionalist role in the project methodology while also reflecting on the organizational practices observed. Using an abductive and constructivist approach, the study material revolved around the mental representations of the practitioners involved in this collective, gathered through semi-structured interviews, participant observations and documentary research.FindingsThis research characterizes a process of emergence of a collective of organizations that includes an activation phase consisting of triggering factors contributing to the construction of shared mental representations and a phase of specific structuring of the collective action of the organization collective in the making. These two phases lay the foundations for the organizational collective responsible for managing not only the initial project but also other projects and operations, thus ensuring its longevity.Research limitations/implicationsIt is based on a single exploratory case study with a limited sample of members of an organizational collective. In addition, it is specific to the healthcare sector, the HR field and the hierarchical level of the members we worked with. With a view to verifying, consolidating and generalizing knowledge, it would be pertinent to test these results in other empirical contexts.Practical implicationsThe direct managerial interest of our study will therefore lie in the recommendations addressed to players wishing to become involved in a collective of organizations. The organizational collective is founded on a durability that goes beyond the temporary framework of the project. It would be interesting to know how to contribute to the durability of this collective from the outset, in particular through the routinization of organizational practices generated within the framework of this regulation by management systems. This collective of organizations also generates a value system which, if we refer to the results of our research, goes beyond the objectives of solving the project's problem. It would also be timely to pursue research into the value creation of a collective of organizations.Social implicationsFor a number of years, healthcare policies have been encouraging the development of collective organizations through greater coordination, supply chains, care networks, etc. (Valette, 2019). Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge the scarcity of management science research on the subject in this sector, despite the fact that public policy incentives to reorganize the healthcare system are constantly highlighting them. In concrete terms, since the 2016 Modernization Act, numerous organizational collectives in response to major public health challenges have been deployed, such as professional communities in healthcare territories, Art 51 pathways, etc. (Observatoire National de la Qualit & eacute; de vie au travail, 2021). Originality/valueDespite extensive research into the characteristics and modes of operation of organizational collectives, little is known about their emergence process (Viollet and Dreveton, 2023). Moreover, there is little management science research on organizational collectives in the healthcare sector, even though public policy incentives are constantly encouraging them. Our aim is to fill this gap by answering the question: How does an organizational collective emerge?","[Gelize, Maialen; Darras, Nathalie] ESTIA, Estia Rech, Bidart, France",,"Gélizé, M (corresponding author), ESTIA, Estia Rech, Bidart, France.",m.gelize@estia.fr; n.darras@estia.fr,,,,,,,65,0,0,4,4,,,,1460-1060,1758-7115,,,,2024 DEC 3,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/EJIM-04-2024-0418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-04-2024-0418,,DEC 2024,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analysis draws on findings from a case study of market deregulation in the subtropical dairy industry. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dairy producers, their service providers, and industry and government staff. We found the adaptive cycle concept contributed to understanding how deregulation changed industry structures and working practices, how those changes led to feedbacks within the production system and supply chain, and how the industry following deregulation has experienced periods of stability and instability. Regime shifts were associated with an increase in demand for human capital, a degradation of cognitive social capital and a reduction in farm income. Findings identified that were not readily explained by the resilience thinking conceptual framework include a producer's ability to anticipate and make choices and the change in social and power relationships in the industry.","[Sinclair, Katrina] New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Wollongbar, NSW 2477, Australia; [Curtis, Allan] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Mendham, Emily] Charles Sturt Univ, Natl Ctr Groundwater Res & Training, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Mitchell, Michael] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Charles Sturt University; National Centre for Groundwater Research & Training; Charles Sturt University; University of Tasmania,"Sinclair, K (corresponding author), New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Wollongbar, NSW 2477, Australia.",katrina.sinclair@dpi.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,,51,51,57,1,111,,,,0889-048X,1572-8366,,,,SEP,2014,31,3,,,,,371,384,,10.1007/s10460-014-9488-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-014-9488-4,,,,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; History & Philosophy Of Science; Sociology",,Agriculture; History & Philosophy of Science; Sociology,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Of particular note is the proliferation of corporate regulation to govern socially responsible behavior in recent legislative reforms in the EU and U.K. In seeking to answer the broader question of whether corporate regulation indeed effectively governs and moderates corporate behavior, this paper focuses on the nature of corporate regulation. Although different pieces of corporate regulation purport to achieve different objectives and impose different types of obligations, this paper offers an institutional account of corporate regulation, specifically in relation to the U.K.'s regulatory capitalism, as the U.K. is typically held up as having a liberal market economy (which is broadly similar to the U.S.). In this article, I argue that the nature and effectiveness of corporate regulation crucially depends on the nature of regulatory capitalism in the type of economic order under discussion. Hence the study of the UK.'s economic order and its efforts in introducing corporate regulation to change corporate behavior holds lessons more generally for corporate regulation in economies that share similar features. The examination in this article provides an overarching framework for distilling the achievements and limitations of corporate regulation in such economic contexts. First, the paper clarifies that regulatory capitalism in the U.K. is characterized by three key tenets that reflect the spirit of the liberal market economy embraced here. Over time, gaps have been revealed in the achievements of these tenets of regulatory capitalism, particularly in relation to social expectations of the regulation of corporate behavior. These gaps have become the subject of debates in the realm of corporate social responsibility (CSR), where business, civil society, and the state frame the expectations of corporate behavior in contested ways: in relation to the scope of responsibility, the motivations for corporate behavior, the theoretical premises, and business practices. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, we observe increasing legalization in the EU and U.K. of CSR issues, framed in new governance regulatory techniques. They hold promise for change in corporate conduct through deeper forms of corporate engagement and accountability, but they appear at the same time relatively undemanding and susceptible to cosmetic compliance. By discussing key examples in new corporate regulation reforms in the EU and U.K., we seek to understand why recent corporate regulation reforms seem to offer mixed and, in some cases, relatively limited achievements in governing corporate behavior. We argue that the institutional account of corporate regulation continues to be able to explain regulatory weaknesses and limited achievements, in spite of the deployment of new governance regulatory techniques. This is because new governance regulatory techniques are implemented within the ethos of regulatory capitalism which limits their potential to introduce paradigm shifts. However, the limitations of these regulatory reforms highlight more sharply the institutional shifts that are needed in order to connect the efficacy of corporate regulation with meeting social expectations.","[Chiu, Iris H-Y] UCL, Corp Law & Financial Regulat, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Chiu, IHY (corresponding author), UCL, Corp Law & Financial Regulat, London, England.",,,,,,,,549,2,4,0,29,,,,0196-3228,,,,,WIN,2019,39,2,,,,,85,170,,,,,,,Law,,Government & Law,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trade unions are one particular civil society group whose participation in MSIs has received little scholarly attention so far. The objective of this paper is to examine the determinants that enable and constrain trade union participation in MSIs. Based on interviews, focus groups, observations and document analysis we determine local trade union participation in three MSIs, operating at company, national and transnational level respectively, in the Costa Rican pineapple industry. To explain the limited encountered trade union participation, an analytical framework is developed combining structural and agency dimensions, namely the MSI design and trade union's power resources. The findings show shortcomings in the representativeness, procedural fairness and consensual orientation in the design and implementation of the MSIs. These are, however, not sufficient to explain weak trade union participation as trade union power resources also have an influence. Strong network embeddedness and improved infrastructural resources had a positive effect, whereas the lack of internal solidarity and unfavourable narrative resources constrained the unions' participation.","[Martens, Deborah; Orbie, Jan] Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gansemans, Annelien; D'Haese, Marijke] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Martens, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr EU Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",deborah.martens@ugent.be; annelien.gansemans@ugent.be; jan.orbie@ugent.be; marijke.dhaese@ugent.be,,,Ghent University Special Research Fund for Interdisciplinary Research Projects,Ghent University Special Research Fund for Interdisciplinary Research Projects,This research was financed by the Ghent University Special Research Fund for Interdisciplinary Research Projects.,,84,8,9,0,9,,,,,2071-1050,,,,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,4295,10.3390/su10114295,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114295,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify the key Islamic banking sustainability indicators, the authors selected the most cited sustainability measurement indexes in Islamic banking. Initially, the indexes were divided into 10 broader themes, and then the key Islamic banking sustainability indicators were shortlisted from each theme based on their high-frequency distribution. The shortlisted sustainability indicators were then ratified to be in line with Islamic philosophy based on Maqasid al-Shariah (objectives of Shariah) and were subsequently grouped into the three dimensions of economic, environmental, and social sustainability based on the axial coding method. Finally, the categorized sustainability indicators were aligned with the relevant UN SDGs through the axial coding method for policy formulation, and respectively 12 propositions were developed for policy formulation. This study labeled the methodological process of this study as the ECA method (exploration, categorization, alignment). The new ECA method offers a reverse extension in the SDG compass developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for aligning business policies with the UN SDGs. The process of aligning Islamic banking sustainability indicators with the UN SDGs will provide a roadmap to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of economic, environmental, and social issues. Due to the diversity of the UN SDG framework, it covers multiples aspects for sustainable development. Therefore, considering the UN SDGs in terms of various banking instruments will mitigate the multiple distressing impacts of COVID-19 on the triple bottom line (people, planet, and profit), it will also promote a sustainable development agenda.","[Jan, Amin] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management & Humanities, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Mata, Mario Nuno; Martins, Jose Moleiro] Polytech Inst Lisbon, ISCAL Lisbon Super Inst Accounting & Adm, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Albinsson, Pia A.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Mkt & Supply Chain Management, Peacock Hall 4114,ASU Box 32090, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Martins, Jose Moleiro] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, P-1069035 Lisbon, Portugal; [Hassan, Rusni Bt] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, IIUM Inst Islamic Banking & Finance, Jalan Gombak, Kuala Lumpur 53000, Malaysia; [Mata, Pedro Neves] Lisbon Polytech Inst, ESCS Escola Super Comunicacao Social, P-1549014 Lisbon, Portugal; [Mata, Pedro Neves] ISTA Univ Inst Lisbon ISCTE IUL, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; International Islamic University Malaysia; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon,"Jan, A (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management & Humanities, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",amin_jan_khan@yahoo.com; mnmata@iscal.ipl.pt; albinssonpa@appstate.edu; zdmmartins@gmail.com; hrusni@iium.edu.my; pmata@escs.ipl.pt,,,,,,,63,37,38,3,36,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR,2021,13,5,,,,,,,2607,10.3390/su13052607,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052607,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach Conceptual theory building combined with content analysis is used to develop a framework and propositions representing a middle-range theory of sustainable GS. A literature review of the 89 most influential papers is followed by a further discussion based on the resource orchestration perspective (ROP) to advance an integrated conceptual framework. Findings Three main themes are identified from the literature as antecedents, GS practices and sustainable performance, with each theme being detailed in a variety of constructs. Based on the ROP, the relationships between these constructs are revealed, and therefore, an integrated conceptual framework is advanced via three sets of propositions in recourse orchestration breadth, recourse orchestration depth and resource orchestration evolution, respectively. Eight directions for future research are further proposed. Originality/value First, this study provides a comprehensive framework for future study in the emergent field of sustainable GS. Second, the authors contribute to theory development by proposing a ROP to explore the GS practices towards sustainability. Third, the future research directions we proposed can benefit scholars interested in the overlapping areas of GS and sustainability.","[Jiang, Yan] Middlesex Univ, Dept Management, London, England; [Jia, Fu] Univ York, York Management Sch, Heslington, England; [Blome, Constantin] Univ Sussex, Falmer, England; [Chen, Lujie] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Middlesex University; University of York - UK; University of Sussex; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Jia, F (corresponding author), Univ York, York Management Sch, Heslington, England.",fu.jia@exeter.ac.uk,,,Humanities and Social Sciences project of The Ministry of Education of China [17YJA630034]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2017J01519],Humanities and Social Sciences project of The Ministry of Education of China; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province),The authors appreciate the financial support from Humanities and Social Sciences project of The Ministry of Education of China (Grant number: 17YJA630034) and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (No. 2017J01519).,,172,22,22,11,84,,,,1359-8546,1758-6852,,,,JAN 13,2020,25,1,,,,,35,60,,10.1108/SCM-12-2018-0448,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-12-2018-0448,,,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 232 papers published in the last 23 years (2000-2023) are reviewed to assess the breadth of research perspectives in dry port sustainable operations. Additionally, the findings summarize current research trends, identify flaws in the body of knowledge, and suggest potential research areas. A bibliographic analysis approach is deployed to explore the existing body of knowledge, review the concepts in depth, and narrow the focus on potential research areas. Within this context, a content analysis technique has been utilized to explore and understand the conceptual underpinnings of specific themes, typically involving trending subjects like sustainability, dry ports, inland ports, economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. Tools such as BibExcel and VOSviewer were utilized to assist in conducting the bibliometric analysis. The majority of dry port research has concentrated on the definition, functions, policy and governance, location analysis, ownership, and dry port-seaport interaction. Less attention is paid to dry port sustainability in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the interaction of internal and external collaboration with dry port sustainability, dry port social sustainability, dry port economic sustainability, dry port environment sustainability, and dry port service quality. Specifically, there has been limited research output on the sustainability of dry ports within the context of landlocked nations. This study will raise awareness of unexplored areas for further research by focusing on critical issues that are not generally covered by scholars in existing literature, such as dry port internal sustainability management and external collaboration.","[Beyene, Zellalem Tadesse; Jaleta, Matiwos Ensermu] Addis Ababa Univ, Sch Commerce, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Nadeem, Simon Peter] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Derby DE22 1GB, England; [Kreie, Andre] Kuhne Fdn, Logist Educ Emerging & Developing Countries LEED, Dorfstr 50, CH-8834 Schindellegi, Switzerland",Addis Ababa University; University of Derby,"Beyene, ZT (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Sch Commerce, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",zellalem.tadesse@aau.edu.et; s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk; matiwos.ensermu@aau.edu.et; andre.kreie@kuehne-foundation.org,,,,,,,89,7,7,14,41,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JAN,2024,16,1,,,,,,,263,10.3390/su16010263,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16010263,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined the relationship between the concerns of Chinese consumers regarding food fraud, and the role that demonstrating authenticity may play in relieving those concerns. Methods A two-stage mixed method design research design was adopted. First, qualitative research (focus groups n = 7) was conducted in three Chinese cities, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu to explore concerns held by Chinese consumers in relation to food fraud. A subsequent quantitative survey (n = 850) tested hypotheses derived from the qualitative research and theoretical literature regarding the relationship between attitudinal measures (including risk perceptions, social trust, and perceptions of benefit associated with demonstrating authenticity), and behavioral intention to purchase authentic European products using structural equation modelling. Results Chinese consumers perceive food fraud to be a hazard that represents a food safety risk. Food hazard concern was identified to be geographically influenced. Consumers in Chengdu (tier 2 city) possessed higher levels of hazard concern compared to consumers in Beijing and Guangzhou (tier 1). Structural trust (i.e. trust in actors and the governance of the food supply chain) was not a significant predictor of attitude and intention to purchase authenticated food products. Consumers were shown to have developed 'risk-relieving' strategies to compensate for the lack of trust in Chinese food and the dissonance experienced as a consequence of food fraud. Indexical and iconic authenticity cues provided by food manufacturers and regulators were important elements of product evaluations, although geographical differences in their perceived importance were observed. Conclusions Targeted communication of authenticity assurance measures, including; regulations; enforcement; product testing; and actions taken by industry may improve Chinese consumer trust in the domestic food supply chain and reduce consumer concerns regarding the food safety risks associated with food fraud. To support product differentiation and retain prestige, European food manufactures operating within the Chinese market should recognise regional disparities in consumer risk perceptions regarding food fraud and the importance of personal risk mitigation strategies adopted by Chinese consumers to support the identification of authentic products.","[Kendall, H.; Kuznesof, S.; Raley, M.; Clark, B.; Frewer, L.

While several authors have analyzed the motives of these measures individually, this article provides a broader explanation for their diffusion. In empirical terms, it focuses on `conflict minerals' and illegally logged timber. Building on the classical norm life cycle, the article's argument is threefold. Firstly, it argues that these mandatory due diligence policies are the result of a new foreign accountability norm concerning the conditions under which natural resources are extracted. Secondly, it shows that the emergence of this norm is the result of strategic framing, in particular by moral entrepreneurs. International NGOs have successfully advocated the foreign accountability norm by placing it within already existing free market norms, instead of provoking open confrontation. Thirdly, in addition to the classical norm life cycle, the article shows that agency has also played a crucial role in the current phase of norm cascade. `Fair business' entrepreneurs benefit from new markets for certified products, such as `conflict free' phones, and their marketing enhances the norm cascade.

Finally, people's sustainable employability can be improved. Highly sustainable employability employees can continue to work in the labour market and their working lives can be prolonged. Labour market supply will increase and labour shortage will be partly solved. Methods: We discuss the concept of sustainable employability based on some previous studies. Our conclusion is that the existing definitions and measurement dimensions are problematic. The swAge-model, a tool that helps us understand how to make working life more sustainable and healthier for all ages, can be the basis of sustainable employability. Results: We develop a discussion paper concerning the definition and measurement dimensions of sustainable employability using the swAge-model with an added factor of intrinsic work value and the dynamic chain. Conclusions: Our definition of sustainable employability takes environmental factors into consideration and makes it clear that it is not a solely personal characteristic, but the result of an interaction between individuals and the environment, thus distinguishing employability from work ability. We use the swAge-model as a basis to make the composition of our definition more logical and informed. Our measurement dimensions are clearly described to facilitate the future development of a scale, and our concept may ultimately help to extend the working lives of older and retired workers and thus solve the future labour shortage problem.","[Deng, Jianwei; Liu, Jiahao; Deng, Wenhao; Yang, Tianan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econom, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Deng, Jianwei; Yang, Tianan] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Duan, Zhezhe] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Urban Governance, Sch Govt, Shenzhen 215123, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Shenzhen University,"Yang, TA (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econom, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Yang, TA (corresponding author), Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Duan, ZZ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Inst Urban Governance, Sch Govt, Shenzhen 215123, Peoples R China.",Dengjianwei2006@163.com; bitliujiahao@163.com; dwenhao215@163.com; tianan.yang@bit.edu.cn; duanzz@szu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974011, 72174022, 71603018, 71804009]; China National Social Science Foundation [20ZDA024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China National Social Science Foundation,"This research was funded by [the National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [71974011, 72174022, 71603018, 71804009] and [2020 China National Social Science Foundation Major Project] grant number [Grants 20ZDA024].",,55,10,10,17,71,,,,,1660-4601,,,,DEC,2021,18,24,,,,,,,13230,10.3390/ijerph182413230,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413230,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,"Green Published, gold",,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Neilson, J; Pritchard, B",,,,"Neilson, Jeff; Pritchard, Bill",,,Fairness and ethicality in their place: the regional dynamics of fair trade and ethical sourcing agendas in the plantation districts of South India,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,,,,Article,,,,,,,SUPPLY CHAINS; FOOD,"In this paper we argue for a 'horizontal' approach to the analysis of fair and ethical trade, one which asks questions about the wider eddies they create within regional production contexts. This approach runs counter to much of the existing literature on the topic, which typically examines initiatives 'vertically', in terms of how they affect the lives of participating producers and communities. Applying this method to critique fair and ethical trade in the tea and coffee plantation districts of South India, we find that, at present, initiatives fail to intersect with the most pressing problems of poverty and development within this regional production system. Somewhat ironically, these schemes seem to be having their greatest positive effects within industry segments that are not the most needful of support, and tend to have very limited engagement with those industry participants in direst straits (notably, smallholders and workers on abandoned estates). Consideration of these issues highlights how the uneven penetration of fair and ethical trade is contributing to transformations in the institutional formations and systems of governance. Producers oriented to servicing affluent Western markets are increasingly enmeshed within fair and ethical trade agendas and interact with dense ensembles of suprastate and civil society regulation (involving international nongovernmental organisations and audit firms). Yet, more marginalised producers remain regulated by traditional institutional mechanisms embedded within the nation-state (government departments, trade unions, etc). These assessments point to the limitations and challenges facing fair and ethical trade as a strategic intervention for addressing the social, economic, and environmental injustices of global agriculture.","[Neilson, Jeff; Pritchard, Bill] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Neilson, J (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Madsen Bldg, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia.",j.neilson@usyd.edu.au; b.pritchard@usyd.edu.au,,,,,,,53,61,69,1,41,,,,0308-518X,1472-3409,,,,AUG,2010,42,8,,,,,1833,1851,,10.1068/a4260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a4260,,,,Environmental Studies; Geography,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using insights from transaction cost and resource dependence theories, this paper aims to explore how to balance coercive and non-coercive powers to enhance GSI and the mediating role of relationship commitment and the moderating role of relationship closeness. Design/methodology/approach To validate the hypotheses, this study conducted hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping using the survey data collected from 206 Chinese manufacturers. Findings The results indicate that coercive power undermines normative commitment, while non-coercive power promotes normative and instrumental commitments. Both normative and instrumental commitments enhance GSI. Normative commitment mediates the impacts of coercive and non-coercive powers on GSI, while instrumental commitment only mediates the impact of non-coercive power on GSI. Moreover, supplier trust and dependence negatively moderate the positive link between instrumental commitment and GSI. Practical implications Executives should carefully balance coercive and non-coercive powers to encourage firms to maintain good relationships with suppliers and develop common environmental values under different mediating effects of normative and instrumental commitments. However, they should also be aware that high level of trust and dependence can affect the impacts of powers.

Although many scholars have studied the issue of enterprise sustainability, to date, the institutional and risk control perspectives of sustainability have received less attention, particularly in manufacturing practices. To address research gap, this study develops a comprehensive framework for evaluating enterprise sustainability that encompasses the economic, social, environmental, institutional, and risk control dimensions. A novel group decision-making approach, called the Rough-Fermatean Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique is proposed, which identifies the mutual relationships among the 15 evaluation criteria and generates the influence weights. Fermatean fuzzy theory is used to reflect the subjective judgment of experts and the inherent uncertainty in evaluation. Moreover, rough set theory is used to aggregate the multiple experts' opinions and to retain potential information in the form of interval values. A case study of Taiwan's electronics manufacturers is carried out to demonstrate the practicality and validity of the proposed approach. The results show that goodwill and corporate image, zero emission of pollutants and waste discharge, and corporate governance are the most influential sustainability criteria. This study can assist decision-makers in the manufacturing sector in developing more appropriate improvement strategies. Enterprises can improve their competitiveness and move towards sustainable development by first focusing on the more influential criteria. For academic researchers, the proposed framework and methodology can be applied to the discussion of sustainability evaluation in other industries.","[Kao, Fang-Chen] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Kao, Fang-Chen; Huang, Shu-Chin; Lo, Huai-Wei] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chin-Yi University of Technology; Chaoyang University of Technology,"Lo, HW (corresponding author), Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.",jenkao66@gmail.com; schuang2@gm.cyut.edu.tw; w110168888@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 110-2222-E324-001-MY2],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan.

Methodology/Approach - Starting from an examination of the extant literature on CSR e-communication, the paper identified several key dimensions of the selected topic. Then, through a content analysis research design, the study explores how companies communicate on corporate websites their CSR efforts, applying a four-dimensional model. Findings - Different from assumptions (not demonstrated) in the previous research, the paper highlights that Business-to-Business (B-to-B) companies are more prone than Close-to-Market (C2M) organizations to be engaged in the disclosure both of CSR orientation (i.e. how their value statements reflect their commitment to sustainability) and structure (i.e. how they communicate their governance structure and certifications of CSR and how they engage with stakeholders). Moreover, the paper shows similarities in how C2M and B-to-B companies communicate their efforts in using interactive tools and presenting CSR content on their corporate websites. Research Implications - From a conceptual point of view, both institutional and political theories can explain why disclosure of CSR values, governance structures, and engagement mechanisms is becoming more and more frequent in B-to-B companies. These kinds of organizations are, in fact, potentially more problematic in terms of environmental issues. Hence, the paper demonstrates that the increased public scrutiny pushes B-to-B companies to play the parts of 'political actors', thus making them more likely to invest in processes that engage different stakeholders in CSR decision-making. Practical Implications - The research has the merit of tracing back the main differences between C2M and B-to-B companies in terms of CSR e-communication to the inherent nature of the industry to which organizations belong. This involves the view that managers of B-to-B companies can benefit from suggestions on how to use CSR e-communication to sustain specific corporate strategies. B-to-B companies are becoming more aware that mechanisms for approaching CSR communication can help them to prevent greenwashing accusations, which are very common and risky for industrial companies and their partners. Originality/Value/Contribution of the paper - The paper adds several insights to the debate on CSR communication in B-to-B research, pointing out the constitutive dimensions and the diverse motivations that can push companies to adopt specific approaches in CSR disclosure.","[Palazzo, Maria; Siano, Alfonso] Univ Salerno, Dept Polit & Commun Sci, Fisciano, Italy; [Vollero, Agostino] Univ Salerno, Social & Commun Sci, Dept Polit, Fisciano, Italy; [Foroudi, Pantea] Middlesex Univ, Dept Mkt Branding & Tourism, London, England",University of Salerno; University of Salerno; Middlesex University,"Palazzo, M (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Polit & Commun Sci, Fisciano, Italy.",mpalazzo@unisa.it,,,,,,,92,13,13,2,48,,,,1051-712X,1547-0628,,,,,2019,26,3-4,,,,,341,355,,10.1080/1051712X.2019.1611087,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1051712X.2019.1611087,,,,Business,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The article proposes a liner shipping multi-objective optimization (MOO) model based on profit maximization, CO2 emissions minimization, and SOx emissions minimization for which all objective functions are a function of vessel sailing speed. Two demand configurations are considered: elastic and inelastic. The MOO model is solved using three different methods and is applied to two liner services deployed on the trans-Pacific and Europe-Far East markets. A single-objective optimization approach is also proposed in which the monetary value of the emissions is considered in an objective function. The main conclusion of the article is that the sensitivity of demand to transit time is based on the gap between economic and environmental optimal solutions and that policies considering imposing a tax on CO2 or SOx to reduce the negative externalities from international shipping should account for this element.","[Cheaitou, Ali] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Sustainable Engn Asset Management SEAM Res Grp, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Cheaitou, Ali] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Ind Engn & Engn Management Dept, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Cariou, Pierre] Kedge Business Sch, MOSI Dept, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33400 Talence, France",University of Sharjah; University of Sharjah; Kedge Business School,"Cheaitou, A (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Sustainable Engn Asset Management SEAM Res Grp, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.;Cheaitou, A (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Ind Engn & Engn Management Dept, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.",acheaitou@sharjah.ac.ae; pierre.cariou@kedgebs.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project [895-2017-1003],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project,This research has been supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) project (No 895-2017-1003): Green Shipping: Governance and Innovation for a Sustainable Maritime Supply Chain.,,50,45,49,6,73,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,FEB,2019,273,1-2,,,SI,,501,525,,10.1007/s10479-018-2786-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-018-2786-2,,,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recognising the lack of scientific evidence for this claim, this paper aims to compare the results of sustainability assessments for 14 local and global food products in four sectors within four European countries. Each sector has been analysed independently using sustain ability indicators across five dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic, social, health and ethics. In order to determine if local products generally perform better, an outranking analysis was conducted to rank the products relative to their sustainability performance. Outranking is a multi-criteria decision aid method that allows comparison of alternatives based on quantitative and qualitative indicators at different scales. Each product is also characterized by a degree of localness in order to relate sustainability and localness. The results are given in the form of phi flows, which are relative preference scores of one product compared to other ones in the same sector. The rankings showed that global products consistently come last in terms of sustainability, even when the preference functions and weighting of the indicators were varied. The first positions of the rankings were taken either by the most local or an intermediary product. Moreover, detailed rankings at the attribute level showed the relative strengths and weaknesses of each food product along the local-global continuum. It appeared that the strength of local and intermediary products was mainly in health and socio-economic dimensions, particularly aspects of care and links to the territory such as biodiversity, animal welfare, governance or resilience. In relation to global food products, they presented substantial advantages in terms of climate change mitigation and affordability to consumers. This contrasts with the food-miles ecological claim. Thus, we conclude that distance is not the most critical factor in improving sustainability of food products, and that other criteria of localness (identity, governance or size) play a more critical role.

Yet, their activities and the resulting negative local externalities continue to pose burdens on the adjacent, and often densely populated, urban areas in which they operate. At present, it has been observed that changes in global economic tendencies affect the traffic configuration of inland ports, leading to substantial spatial and societal repercussions on the inland port-city interface. Therefore, this paper investigates the impacts of five identified global economic tendencies on the traffic patterns of inland ports: containerization, energy transition, sustainable construction, urban logistics, and circular economy. The consequences of related traffic evolutions on inland port infrastructures, as well as relationships with local community stakeholders, are evaluated. As such, our research has been designed in two well-defined ways. First, a quantitative, backward-looking in-depth analysis of past traffic development (1998-2017) of seven Western European inland ports, located within major urban regions, has been carried out, describing general trends in traffic structure evolution in light of the five identified global economic tendencies. The selected inland ports were Basel, Brussels, Charleroi, Frankfurt, Liege, Paris, and Strasbourg. The ports were selected as part of the northwestern Rhine-Seine-Scheldt inland waterways network, connected to the Hamburg-Le Havre range. By means of this sample, all major inland navigation corridors, linking the Hamburg-Le Havre range to the hinterland, are represented. Second, a qualitative, forward-looking analysis of the impact of the five identified global economic tendencies on the inland port-city interface has been performed by means of a World Cafe, held during a recent masterplanning process of the Port of Brussels. Based on both approaches, our findings confirm that the economic and environmental transition in inland ports is rapidly accelerating. At the same time, these transitions have the potential to significantly complicate the collaboration between urban stakeholders, in terms of optimal inland port development, urban land and infrastructure use, and the management of local negative externalities.","[Moeremans, Bruno; Dooms, Michael; Haezendonck, Elvira] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Social Sci & Solvay Business Sch, Pleinlaan 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Moeremans, B (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Social Sci & Solvay Business Sch, Pleinlaan 5, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Bruno.moeremans@vub.be,,,,,,,86,4,4,4,52,,,,1479-2931,1479-294X,,,,JUN,2023,25,2,,,SI,,272,300,,10.1057/s41278-022-00233-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41278-022-00233-x,,JUL 2022,,Transportation,,Transportation,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little attention has gone to the position of global export commodities, where production and consumption are far apart. Banana in Costa Rica and cocoa in Cote d'Ivoire were the subject of this study to find out what major drivers determine the functioning of these systems. Next to identifying drivers such as population growth and increased plant disease pressure, it was found that the typical far-away setting and different living conditions between producer and consumer countries required a special eye on governance as a tripartite arena (government, private sector, civil society) with their power relations, and on certification schemes as a driver that follows from corporate social responsibility. The certification schemes addressed cover all food system outcomes, although health and nutrition in a less conspicuous way. The descriptions of the functioning of the schemes were also linked to living wages and incomes for banana plantation workers in Costa Rica and cocoa smallholder farmers in Cote d'Ivoire. Although very meaningful, certification schemes so far do not prove to be a silver bullet, but they do have the potential, in combination with other measures, to help positive food system transformations.","[Alho, Carlos F.

The focus of green logistics practices (GLPs) is on maximizing energy efficiency in logistics services, potentially leading to cost reductions for companies. Such practices can be supported through public reports, such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports, and government policies, including government certification. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the financial efficiency of logistics companies can be improved through the implementation of GLPs and a relevant government policy. To achieve this objective, a two-stage analysis was conducted using Data Envelopment Analysis - Slack-Based Measure (DEA-SBM) and Tobit regression analysis. The DEA-SBM was employed to assess whether the financial efficiency of logistics companies adopting GLPs and a relevant government policy was superior to that of companies not adopting such practices. Additionally, Tobit regression analysis was employed to analyze the effects of GLPs, ESG reports, and a government policy on the financial efficiency of logistics companies. The findings of the study indicate the necessity for collaboration between the private and public sectors to implement GLPs in a financially positive manner. In conclusion, the research demonstrated that the implementation of GLPs, coupled with public disclosure through ESG reports or equivalents and a government policy, had a positive impact on the financial efficiency of logistics companies.","[Kim, Dohyun] Inha Univ, Grad Sch Logist, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Kim, Dohyun; Na, Joonho] Korea Transport Inst, Sejong 30147, South Korea; [Ha, Hun-Koo] Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, Incheon 22212, South Korea",Inha University; Korea Transport Institute; Inha University,"Ha, HK (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",dohyun@koti.re.kr; njh5020@koti.re.kr; hkha@inha.ac.kr,,,Inha University; Korea Transport Institute,Inha University; Korea Transport Institute,This research was supported by Inha University and Korea Transport Institute.,,59,1,1,37,44,,,,,2405-8440,,,,MAY 30,2024,10,10,,,,,,,e30916,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30916,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30916,,MAY 2024,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

It addresses gaps in understanding how socio-economic, political, and technological factors collectively influence ES and EE during the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The research aims to reveal the complex relationships and potential trade-offs between energy sustainability, economic growth, and equitable energy distribution. Utilizing robust panel data methods including System GMM, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects, the study examines the impacts of various determinants on ES and EE. The dataset includes annual observations on global integration, financial integration, infrastructure quality, political stability, and other relevant metrics from diverse global sources. The findings reveal that increased financial integration significantly enhances ES by easing capital flow into energy infrastructure, which is crucial for stable energy supply chains. Political stability also positively affects ES, underscoring the importance of stable governance in sustaining energy policies. Conversely, rapid urban growth and inadequate social integration pose challenges to achieving EE, highlighting disparities in energy access worsened by urbanization. Technological advancements and digital connectivity appear as positive drivers for EE, enhancing the efficiency and distribution of energy resources. This study contributes to the literature by providing a detailed examination of how integration into global financial and political systems affects energy strategies at a national level. It offers valuable insights for policymakers on fostering environments conducive to sustainable energy development and fair energy access. The research underscores the importance of incorporating socio-economic and technological advancements in energy policy frameworks to achieve balanced growth and sustainability.

While PoW is highly secure, it is energy-intensive, and PoS tends to favour wealthy stakeholders, leading to validator centralisation. Existing mechanisms lack fairness, and the aspect of sustainability is not considered. Moreover, it fails to address social trust dynamics within validator selection. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes Proof of Friendship (PoF)-a novel consensus mechanism that leverages social trust by improving decentralisation, enhancing fairness and sustainability among the validators. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on computational power or financial stakes, PoF integrates friendship-based trust scores with geo-location diversity, transaction reliability, and sustainable energy adoption. By incorporating a trust graph, where validators are selected based on their verified relationships within the network, PoF mitigates the risks of Sybil attacks, promotes community-driven decentralisation, and enhances the resilience of the blockchain against adversarial manipulation. This research introduces the formal model of PoF, evaluates its security, decentralisation, and sustainability trade-offs, and demonstrates its effectiveness compared to existing consensus mechanisms. Our investigation and results indicate that PoF achieves higher decentralisation, improved trustworthiness, reduced validator monopolisation, and enhanced sustainability while maintaining strong network security. This study opens new avenues for socially aware blockchain governance, making consensus mechanisms more equitable, efficient, and environmentally responsible. This consensus mechanism demonstrates a holistic approach to modern blockchain design, addressing key challenges in trust, performance, and sustainability. The mechanism is tested theoretically and experimentally to validate its robustness and functionality. Processing latency (PL), network latency (NL) [transaction size/network speed], synchronisation delays (SDs), and cumulative delay per transaction are 85 ms, 172 ms, 1802 ms, [PL + NL + SD] 2059 ms, respectively.","[Marchang, Jims] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Adv Wellbeing Res Ctr, Sheffield S1 1WB, England; [Marchang, Jims; Keishing, Solan; Kashyap, Indranee] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sch Comp & Digital Technol, Sheffield S1 1WB, England; [Srikanth, Rengaprasad] BT Grp, Supply Chain Secur, 1 Braham St, London E1 8EE, England",Sheffield Hallam University; Sheffield Hallam University,"Marchang, J (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Adv Wellbeing Res Ctr, Sheffield S1 1WB, England.;Marchang, J (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sch Comp & Digital Technol, Sheffield S1 1WB, England.",jims.marchang@shu.ac.uk; rengaprasad.srikanth@bt.com; s.keishing@shu.ac.uk; indranee.kayshyap@shu.ac.uk,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,,,,2079-9292,,,,,MAR 14,2025,14,6,,,,,,,1153,10.3390/electronics14061153,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics14061153,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",,Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,,,gold,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study aims to identify the key barriers of smart cities from a review of existing literature and views of experts in this area. This work further makes an attempt on the prioritisation of barriers to recognise the most important barrier category and ranking of specific barriers within the categories to the development of smart cities in India. Through the existing literature, this work explored 31 barriers of smart cities development and divided them into six categories. This research work employed fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique to prioritise the selected barriers. Findings reveal that Governance' is documented as the most significant category of barriers for smart city development followed by Economic; Technology'; Social'; Environmental' and Legal and Ethical'. In this work, authors also performed sensitivity analysis to validate the findings of study. This research is useful to the government and policymakers for eradicating the potential interferences in smart city development initiatives in developing countries like India.","[Rana, Nripendra P.; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.] Swansea Univ Bay Campus, Sch Management, Emerging Markets Res Ctr EMaRC, Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales; [Luthra, Sunil] State Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Nilokheri 132117, Haryana, India; [Mangla, Sachin Kumar] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Islam, Rubina] Univ Salford, Salford Business Sch, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England; [Roderick, Sian] Swansea Univ Bay Campus, Sch Management, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales",University of Plymouth; University of Salford,"Dwivedi, YK (corresponding author), Swansea Univ Bay Campus, Sch Management, Emerging Markets Res Ctr EMaRC, Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales.",nrananp@gmail.com; sunilluthra1977@gmail.com; sachin.kumar@plymouth.ac.uk; rubislam@gmail.com; s.roderick@swansea.ac.uk; ykdwivedi@gmail.com,,,,,,,135,145,155,2,48,,,,1387-3326,1572-9419,,,,JUN,2019,21,3,,,SI,,503,525,,10.1007/s10796-018-9873-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-018-9873-4,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",,Computer Science,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

High complexity, continuous processes, integrated dynamics, and adaptability issues challenge the sustainable decision-making process for NIDIs'. Hence, the United Nations has directed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to overcome this ambiguity. This paper examines the challenges in monitoring the targets outlined in SDG 2 (2.3, 2.4, 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)) and SDG 12 (12.1, 12.3, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, and 12(a)) of the United Nations's 2030 goals. The proposed goals could effectively address inventory stocks, appropriate policy selections, perishability, and stochastic market demand. Therefore, this study develops a novel framework by hand-mapping the SDGs and their targets with NIDIs sustainability practices, reflected in its environmental, social, and governance aspects. This paper also includes a systematic literature review (2006 to 2022) to identify sustainable models of NIDIs along with variables, barriers, different mathematical programming approaches, optimal performance criteria, and proposed application framework. Moreover, the findings offer a dual contribution: aiding academic analysis of NIDIs about SDGs and proposing a sustainable modeling framework for practitioners, fostering stakeholder collaboration, and integrating current research trends and agendas for future research directions.","[Maheshwari, Pratik] Indian Inst Management Jammu, Jammu 180016, India; [Kamble, Sachin] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France; [Belhadi, Amine] Int Univ Rabat, Rabat Business Sch, Sale, Morocco; [Kumar, Satish] Indian Inst Management Nagpur, Nagpur, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Jammu; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; Universite Internationale de Rabat; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Nagpur,"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Management Nagpur, Nagpur, India.",pratik@iimj.ac.in; sachin.kamble@edhec.edu; Belhadi.amine@outlook.com; satish@iimnagpur.ac.in,,,,,,,160,0,0,11,11,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,2024 AUG 1,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10479-024-06144-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-024-06144-9,,AUG 2024,,Operations Research & Management Science,,Operations Research & Management Science,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article brings a state-corporate crime lens to bear on the economic and political processes that shape Global South-located commodity production. It seeks to understand the functioning of neo-imperialist profiteering through elaborating the concept of regimes of extreme permission, described as modalities of 'intense' accumulation, defined by weaker or unstable forms of hegemony consolidation, illegal/illicit practices, state-sanctioned violence and various socio-environmental degradations. Through analyses of two regimes of extreme permission in the SE Asian context-Indonesian palm oil plantations and Export Processing Zones for garment production in the Greater Mekong Subregion-the paper describes the role of states and corporations in constructing the repressive socio-political space required for neo-colonial corporate accumulation. We contribute to 'Southernizing' criminology by re-articulating state-corporate crime theory within imperialist contexts. It also shows that neo-colonialism can be understood as the de-regulation of corporate accumulation.","[Ciocchini, Pablo; Greener, Joe] Univ Liverpool, Sch Law & Social Justice Bldg, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZR, England",University of Liverpool,"Ciocchini, P (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Law & Social Justice Bldg, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZR, England.",p.ciocchini@liverpool.ac.uk; j.greener@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,77,10,10,2,7,,,,0007-0955,1464-3529,,,,AUG 17,2023,63,5,,,,,1309,1326,,10.1093/bjc/azac091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azac091,,DEC 2022,,Criminology & Penology,,Criminology & Penology,,,hybrid,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
