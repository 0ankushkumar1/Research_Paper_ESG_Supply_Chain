# Research Analysis: Bibliometric and Data Visualization Study

This repository contains the data and code for a research study that performs bibliometric analysis and visualization on datasets collected from **Web of Science (WOS)** and **Scopus**. The analysis was conducted using **Python**, with additional visualizations generated using **VOSviewer**.

## üìå Summary

- **Data Sources**: 
  - Web of Science (WOS)
  - Scopus

- **Processed Output**:
  - A cleaned and merged CSV dataset for unified analysis.

- **Tools & Technologies Used**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `networkx`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk` (Python libraries)
  - VOSviewer for co-authorship, keyword co-occurrence, and citation network visualizations.

- **Notebook**:
  - `research_analysis.ipynb` contains the full analysis workflow, including:
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Bibliometric indicators (e.g., top authors, institutions, keywords)
    - Network construction and clustering
    - Visualizations and insights

## üîç Objectives

- To integrate and harmonize bibliometric data from multiple scholarly databases.
- To identify key trends, themes, and patterns in the research domain.
- To visualize collaboration networks and keyword evolution over time.

## üìä Visualizations

- Interactive and static visualizations created in Python.
- VOSviewer visualizations for enhanced bibliometric network insights.
